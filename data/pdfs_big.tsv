ISOLATION OF VIRUSES FROM WILD MAMMALS IN WEST AFRICA, 1966-1970 GRAHAM E. KEMP*, OTTIS R. CAUSEY*, HENRY W. SETZERt, and DOROTHY 1. MOORE* Abstract: During the S-year period 1966-1970, a total of 7497 wild mammals of at least 101 different species were collected from 36 locations in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo and sampled for virus. The collections were made in five ecologically distinct vegetative zones: high forest, Guinea, Sudan, and Sahel woodland, and the J05 Plateau. Sixteen different virus types, represented by 83 isolates, were recovered, as follows: Arumowot (6 isolates), Bhanja (2), bluetongue type 7 (1), Chandipura (1), Congo (2), Dakar bat (3), Dugbe (1), IbAn 17143 (1), IbAn 33709 (1), Lebombo (1), Mokola (4), poxvirus IbAn 34325 (1), Semliki Forest (1), SudAn 754/6 1 (53), Uganda 5 (3), and West Nile (2). Viruses were isolated from Nigeria, the principal area of mammal collecting, and Dahomey, but not from Togo. The possible relationship of these viruses to diseases of man and domestic animals is discussed. Over the past 10 years, the Virus Re- search Laboratory (VRL) at the Univer- sity of Ibadan has examined materials from a variety of sources for the presence of arboviruses. Isolations have been at- tempted from man, domestic and wild animals, reptiles, and arthropods, as well as from sentinel mammals and birds.6’#{176} This report deals with a single aspect of the surveillance, namely, the virologic investigation of wild mammals collected in the environs of Ibadan and on numer- ous field trips in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo during the period 1966-1970. Many of these collections were made conjointly with personnel of the Smithsonian Institu- tion, Division of Mammals, who were then engaged in a Pan-African mammal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection and Identification of Animals Cooperative studies between the VRL and the Smithsonian Institution were carried out in Nigeria in 1966 and 1967, and in Dahomey and Togo in 1968. Since the primary objective of the Smith- sonian team was to collect mammals from a variety of habitats for correla- tion of taxonomic and ecologic data, most of the animals they captured were prepared as permanent museum speci- mens and later definitively identified in Washington, D.C. These animals were routinely made available for virologic assay, but not all were actually sampled. Conversely, not all the animals collected by the VRL were prepared as museum specimens; indeed, as VRL staff gained proficiency in identification, it was neces- sary only occasionally to send museum specimens to the Smithsonian for verifi- cation of species. During 1967, responsibility for mam- mal trapping in the vicinity of Ibadan was gradually assumed by the VRL, and during the years 1968 through 1970 all collecting and processing of animals in Nigeria was done by VRL staff. Collection Sites Collecting was done at 36 sites (see map, Fig. 1). Continuing collections were * Virus Research Laboratory, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.

A detailed listing of the locations is omitted in favor of general information about the vegetative zones in which the sites occur: high forest, Guinea wood- land, Jos Plateau, Sudan woodland, and Sahel woodland. The following account is based on Keay’s” description of Ni- gerian vegetation. The entire region sampled is tropical and experiences high temperatures the year round. As one proceeds from south to north, however, the dry season be- comes progressively longer, so that an- nual rainfall varies overall from 355 cm in portions of the high forest zone to as low as 25 cm in the Sahel woodland zone. The vegetation varies accordingly. The high forest zone of Nigeria, a belt of dense rain forest with tall trees form- ing a canopy, has suffered vast patchy destruction owing to heavy human popu- lation pressure, and much of it now qualifies as “derived savannah.” This is particularly true of the area surrounding Ibadan, which city is located near the northern limit of the forest zone and has an annual rainfall of about 122 cm. The Guinea woodland zone, next to the north, typically consists of rather open woodland, with smaller trees (about 12 m) and tall bunchy grass. The dry season here lasts an average of S months; FIGURE 1. Map showing locations in West Africa where wild mammals were collected, 1966- 1970. [Map adapted from D. R. Rosevear. 1965. The Bats of West Africa. British Museum (Nat. Hist.).] Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 281 annual rainfall varies from 122 to 102 cm, south to north; and the lowest mean relative humidity is 28%. The Jos Plateau, although located in the northern Guinea zone, is considered separately because of its very different altitude-about 1280 m above sea level. As a result of widespread degradation by man, the plateau today consists of wide grassy plains dotted with rocky hills that may or may not be wooded. In recent years, rainfall has varied from 122 cm to as high as 172 cm.� Two of the four collecting sites on the plateau were visited twice: Jos town, in 1969 and 1970; and the village of Panyam, in 1967 and 1969. The Sudan woodland zone is clearly differentiated from the Guinea zone: the dry season average 7 months; annual rainfall varies from 84 to 71 cm, south to north; and the lowest mean relative humidity is 23%. In Nigeria, nearly all of the Sudan zone has been inhabited for centuries, with consequent modifi- cation of the vegetation by farming. More of the trees here have thorns than in the Guinea zone, and the grass is shorter and feathery. At Kware, a village 13 miles north of Sokoto, collecting was done in both May and November 1966 and again in 1970. Methods of Collection In the vicinity of Ibadan, ordinarily two collections were made each week. Terrestrial mammals were caught mainly by snap traps, although folding aluminum box traps were also used. Occasionally traps were placed on tree limbs to cap- ture arboreal rodents. Insectivorous bats were caught in mist nets set up in strate- gic positions near the openings from which the animals emerged for evening flights; frugivorous bats were caught in mist nets placed adjacent to fruiting trees or shrubs. On occasion, mist nets were strung in locations that favored the cap- ture of both insectivorous and frugivor- ous species. During field trips, animals were cap- tured or were purchased dead or alive from local residents. Official personnel captured small animals mainly by the use of snap traps, but again some fold- ing aluminum traps were used. Ordin- arily traps were set late in the afternoon and checked early the next morning; however, if ants were found to be at- tacking the trapped animals, checks were also made at intervals during the night. Bats were either caught in mist nets or else were shot, usually during the day as they rested in leafy trees but occasionally when they were on the wing in the early evening. Some night hunting was con- ducted to capture nocturnally active mammals of many different genera. Sampling of Tissues for Virologic Studies Most animals were killed in the process of capture. All, whether dead or alive, were immediately treated with chloro- form to immobilize parasites. Live ani- mals were then killed by exsanguination under anesthesia or, if blood was not taken, by the use of chloroform. After identification, the animal was brushed by hand to loosen ticks, fleas, lice, and mites, which were collected in a white enamel pan. In the case of animals re- quiring more definitive identification, the host was then weighed, measured, and carefully prepared as a museum speci- men, the cleaned skull being preserved separately for later taxonomic studies. All components of a single animal were labeled with the same number. Tissues were then taken from the carcass and the carcass discarded. On field trips, approximately 0.1 g samples of liver and spleen were re- moved and placed together in a vial, which was then kept in a cryogenic ves- sel on liquid nitrogen until returned to the laboratory. For animals captured at Ibadan, the organ pool usually consisted of liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and lung. In the case of bats, salivary glands also were removed, with separate instruments, and placed in a vial by themselves. Brain tissue was seldom taken. Although live animals occasionally were bled for sero- logic testing, blood specimens usually were not examined for virus-the one notable exception being the specimens collected at Bassa in 1970 in connection with Lassa fever investigations.3 282 Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 At the laboratory, vials containing tis- sues were stored at -60C in a mechani- cal refrigerator until processed for virus isolation attempts. Blood samples were kept at ambient temperatures until the clot began to retract; after centrifugation, serum was poured into plastic tubes and stored at -60C. Virologic Techniques All attempts to isolate virus were car- ried out by intracerebral (ic) inoculation of 2- or 3-day-old mice. The methods used in processing of specimens, inocu- lation of mice, passaging of isolates, and characterization of agents have been de- scribed.5#{176} Reisolation was not always at- tempted. Once established by passage in mice, viruses were screened in comple- ment-fixation tests against a battery of reference immune mouse ascitic fluids for agents previously isolated in Ibadan, and immune fluids and antisera from other laboratories. When necessary, iden- tification was confirmed by neutralization test. Agents that remained unidentified were referred to the Yale Arbovirus Re- search Unit, New Haven, Connecticut, for further study. RESULTS During the 5-year period, 7497 wild mammals, collected from each of the major vegetative zones south of the Sahara except the mangrove swamps, were examined for virus (Table 1). These animals comprised at least 101 different species and were collected in all months of the year. The six most frequently taken species, which together made up more than half the total animals sampled, were: multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, 1292; brown grass rat, Arvi- cant/us ni!oticus, 839; shrew, Crocidura complex (perhaps as many as six species), 548; desert gerbil, Tatera kempii, 505; African hedgehog, A te!erix albiventris, 450; and big-toothed mouse, Uranomys ruddi, 441. Sixteen different virus types (83 iso- lates) were recovered from 14 different species of animal (Table 2). Nine virus types were isolated from insectivores, either Atelerix albiventris (6) or Croci- dura sp. (3). Multiple virus types also were isolated from the rodents Tatera kempii (4), Arvicanthzis nilolicus (4), the giant rat, Cricetomys gainbianus (3), and Mastomys nata!ensis (2). SudAn 754/61 virus, the agent most frequently encountered, was recovered 53 times from nine species-one insecti- vore, one primate, and seven rodent. Arumowot virus, second in frequency with six isolates, was recovered from one insectivore and three rodent species. Only one other virus, Bhanja, was re- covered from both an insectivore and a non-insectivore species. Bluetongue type 7, Chandipura, Congo, IbAn 17143, Mo- kola, and Semliki Forest viruses were each exclusive to a single insectivore species. Uganda S virus was isolated from three species, all rodents, and Dugbe, IbAn 33709, Lebombo, poxvirus (IbAn 34325), and West Nile viruses were each exclusive to a single rodent species. Dakar bat virus was obtained only from Tadari- da condy!ura. Table 3 analyzes the distribution of virus isolates by month and in relation to monthly numbers of animals tested. If we assume that the dry season months for the areas sampled are November through March, then in the dry season 10 isolates (8 virus types) were recovered from 3039 animals tested for an isolation rate of 0.3%. If, by corollary, April through October are considered the rainy season months, then in the rainy season 73 isolates (11 types) were obtained from 4458 animals tested for an isolation rate of 1.6%. April and May were the months with the highest isolation percentages, 1.8 and 2.7 respectively. In Table 4, virus isolations are ana- lyzed by vegetative zone and year. The Sudan woodland zone provided the ma- jority of isolates (53) and had the highest isolation rate (2.3%). Both figures re- flect the numerous recoveries of SudAn 754/61 virus, of which 33 were made in 1970 at Kware, during an epizootic caused by this virus in small mammals. Only SudAn 754/61 and Arumowot viruses were encountered in three zones- Guinea woodland, Jos Plateau, and Su- dan woodland.

DISCUSSION It is apparent that small mammals in the regions of West Africa covered by this study are infected with a wide range of viruses. Several of the agents encoun- tered have been implicated in diseases of man or domestic animals, either in Nigeria or elsewhere.

Dugbe, Congo, and Bhanja viruses are tick-borne agents frequently isolated from ixodid ticks and domestic livestock in Nigeria.7’0”8 Dugbe is the virus most commonly recovered by the VRL in Ni- geria and has also been responsible for febrile illnesses in man.00 The present isolation from the giant rat Cricetomys gambianus represents the first of Dugbe from wildlife. Cricetomys occurs in grea- ter numbers in Nigeria than this study would imply, since local residents prefer to eat these rats instead of contributing them for research. Congo virus, associated with human morbidity in Zaire (the former Belgian Congo) and with both morbidity and mortality in East Africa, has recently been shown to be indistinguishable anti- genically from the causative agent of Crimean hemorrhagic fever of man in the USSR.’ The fact that the first two wildlife isolates of Congo virus in Ni- geria came from the African hedgehog, TABLE 4.

Such a reservoir might well consti- tute a source of virus for migratory birds on their way to Europe or Asia, or for their ectoparasites. If so, gathering places for migratory birds may be important as dissemination and virus amplification sites; for example, Malamfatori on Lake Chad, where several avian species as- semble in vast numbers from a wide area of West Africa before crossing the Sahara on their spring migration. Bhanja virus, originally isolated in India from ticks, Haemaphysalis interme- dia, removed from a paralyzed goat,” has not been implicated in human disease. In Nigeria, this virus has been isolated re- peatedly from both livestock� and ticks.1#{176} The present two isolates, from the Afri- can hedgehog and the ground squirrel, Xerus eryt/uropus, are believed to be the first from wildlife. Chandipura, of the vesicular stomatitis (VS) group of arboviruses, was first iso- lated from man in India during an epi- demic in which both it and the presump- tive causative agent, chikungunya virus, were recovered from seemingly indis- tinguishable illnesses.2 The present isola- tion of Chandipura from a hedgehog rep- resents the first of a VS group virus in Africa and has been reported elsewhere.” This finding of the virus in northern Ni- geria, in an important livestock-rearing area, would seem to have possible disease implications in West Africa for both man and his domestic animals. Lebombo is a serologically ungrouped arbovirus that was originally isolated from mosquitoes, A edes circumluteolus, in South Africa (South African Institute for Medical Research, unpublished data). In addition to its recovery in this study from a cutting grass rat, Thryonomys swinderianus, it has been isolated in Nigeria from lice (Scipio aulacodi) ob- tained from the same rat, from Mansonia at ricana (V.H. Lee, personal communica- tion), and from a febrile child.” has been isolated only in Nigeria: from non-nervous tissues of shrews,n from cerebrospinal fluid of a child who sur- vived the infection,’2 and from the brain of a child who died of a paralytic ill- ness.’8 Epidemiologic data pertaining to these infections” and results of experi- mental transmission studies in shrews” are reported elsewhere. This virus may well be a cause of significant morbidity or mortality in West Africa, where shrews are common in urban and rural habitats. The present recovery of Semliki Forest virus, a group A arbovirus, from a hedge- hog represents the first isolation of this agent both in Nigeria and, to our know- ledge, from a naturally infected mammal. Uganda S virus, of arbovirus group B, has been isolated from mosquitoes and from a febrile child in South Africa.” The present three isolates, each from a different rodent genus, may indicate that small mammals play a role in the main- tenance of the virus in nature. This pos- sibility is supported by recovery of Uganda S virus from sentinel baby mice in the vicinity of Ibadan during 1966 (VRL, unpublished data). West Nile virus, also of group B, is widely distributed, having been isolated in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe.’7”'” In man, infection with the virus may range from inapparent infection to feb- rile illness to a dengue-like illness, with or without rash, to encephalitis.3”25” The virus also has been isolated from wild birds,” a bat,” and two naturally in- fected horses with encephalitis, one in Egypt” and the other in France.’6 In Nigeria, isolations have been made from sentinel mice (1965, 1967, 1969), wild birds (1965, 1968), and camels (1969)19 The recoveries from Arvicanthis niloticus reported here are thought to represent the first from rodents. Bluetongue is an important disease of sheep and cattle in some parts of the world. A number of bluetongue virus strains have been recovered from Cu/i- coides spp. in Nigeria;” these seem to cause little or no observable disease in indigenous sheep,” but exotic animals, if introduced into the country, would prob- ably be at risk. The significance of the isolation of bluetongue virus type 7 from Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 291 a shrew is not yet known; however, blue- tongue strains have been isolated from rodents in South Africa.’5 So far there is no evidence to indicate that the remaining six virus types isolated in this study play a role in infections of man or domestic animals. Arumowot and SudAn 754/61 viruses, both members of the Phlebotomus fever group, were first isolated in the Sudan, the former from Culex antennatus in 196382 and the latter from a mixed tissue pool from animals (J. Schmidt, personal communication). Our findings extend their known range from the Sudan in northeast Africa to the savannah areas of West Africa, and one might thus expect these agents to be pre- sent in many of the arid regions of Africa. Neither virus seems to have a pronounced host preference, SudAn 754/61, in particular, having been isola- ted from nine different species of wild mammal in this study. Dakar bat virus is a member of the group B bat salivary gland viruses, which Acknowledgements appear to be host specific and perhaps are able to propagate in their mammal- ian hosts without the need for an arthro- pod vector. Details of the characterization of pox- virus, IbAn 34325, will be reported sep- arately. IbAn 17143 and IbAn 33709 are probably new viruses and are still under study; nothing is yet known concerning their pathogenicity for animals other than mice. It should be noted that most of the iso- lations reported here were made from tis- sue specimens. With the collections at Bassa, however, only serum specimens were tested, and these yielded two isolates of Bhanja virus, and one each of Congo and Dugbe viruses. As already mentioned, the Bhanja and Dugbe isolates represent the first of the two agents from wildlife. Whether more general use of serum, rather than tissues, would have resulted in a greater number of Bhanja and Dugbe isolates is not known. During the period in which these studies were carried out, the Virus Research Laboratory received support from The Rockefeller Foundation. The authors are particularly indebted to the field representatives of the Smithsonian Institu- tion, U.S. National Museum, who made their headquarters at Ibadan. These personnel did a good deal of training of VRL staff in the trapping and identification of animals and the preparation of museum specimens from them for definitive identification in Washington, D.C. In order of their arrival in Ibadan, they were Mr. and Mrs. Harry John Herbert and Mr. and Mrs. Julius Geest. The Smithsonian team in Togo and Dahomey consisted of Mr. Brian Robbins and Mr. James Leduc. All of these field team members deserve special praise in that they performed repetitive, eaacting tasks under difficult living conditions understood only by those who have lived continu- ously in a tent in the humid and arid tropics. Mr. Stanley Akpan assisted in the collection and identification of animals in the Ibadan area and also on trips independent of the Smithsonian teams with VRL staff. Mr. James Phillips col- lected the majority of the primate samples during 1969. Mr. Max.welt Alphonsus assisted in virology, and Mr. Edward O’Connor with identification of viral isolates. Thanks are also due to governmental officials too numerous to mention in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo, who greatly facilitated the attempts to collect animals. LITERATURE CITED I. ALTMAN, R. and W.

Baak-Baak1, Nohemi Cigarroa-Toledo1, Oswaldo M. Torres-Chablé3, Roger Arana-Guardía1, Fernando I. Puerto2, Carlos Machain-Williams1, and Julián E. García-Rejón1* Abstract. Two ectoparasites, spiny rat mite, Echinolaelaps echidninus (Berlese) (n = 27), and spined rat louse, Polyplax spinulosa (Burmeister) (n = 2), were recorded for the first time in Yucatán State and documented with photographs. The ectoparasites were identified mostly on black rat, Rattus rattus (L.), with serological evidence of flavivirus infection. Adult female E. echidninus was most common and found on black rat with serological evidence of yellow fever, Modoc, and Apoi viruses. We also reported for the first time the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouché), on R. rattus. We discussed the potential for the arthropods to bite and transmit pathogens to humans. Introduction In México, the diversity of ectoparasites associated with rodents and transmission of pathogens have seldom been studied. There are 2,625 species of mites in México (Perez et al. 2014). Despite the richness of species, only two records exist of the spiny rat mite, Echinolaelaps echidninus (Berlese), in México (Ramos-Casillas 2002, Estebanes-Gonzales and Cervantes 2005). The mite is common in temperate and tropical zones throughout the world (Strandtmann and Mitchell 1963). It mostly parasitizes the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus (Berkehout) (Furman 1972, Ugbomoiko and Obiamiwe 1991). Previous studies determined it transmitted pathogens (Miller 1908, McLay et al. 2014). Sucking lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) are obligate hematophagous, permanent ectoparasites of mammals and are important vectors of microorganisms that cause a variety of diseases (Crystal 1959). In México are 44 species of sucking lice of nine genera in six families (Sánchez-Montes et al. 2013). The spined rat louse, Polyplax spinulosa (Burmeister), has been reported only twice in México, and was found on R. norvegicus and Rattus rattus (L.) (Mooser et al. 1931). The arthropods were ______________________________ 1Laboratorio de Arbovirología. Centro de Investigaciones Regionales “Dr. Hideyo Noguchi”.

Materials and Methods The study was at Mérida City (population ~800,000) in the Yucatán Peninsula of southeastern México (Fig. 1). The flat and low Yucatán Peninsula (elevation 0-250 m above sea level) has bedrock dominated by limestone and is characterized by a subtropical climate. Weather and housing characteristics at Mérida City were previously described (García-Rejón et al. 2008). Mean monthly maximum temperatures at Mérida range from 29°C in December to 34°C in July, and most rainfall occurs from May to October with a peak from June to September. We identified ectoparasites to determine serological evidence of flavivirus infections in peridomestic rodents at Mérida City (Cigarroa-Toledo et al. 2016). Antibodies for dengue (DENV-4), West Nile, Modoc, Apoi, and yellow fever viruses were found in serum from rodents. Plaque reduction neutralization analysis to detect antibodies for vertebrate-specific flaviviruses might be revised in Cigarroa- Toledo et al. (2016). Rodents were trapped in 20 houses within a 92 square-km area at Mérida City. Trapping at each house was for three consecutive nights every month from October 2011 to September 2012. All houses were within 100 m of vacant lots that contained domestic trash or vegetation. Rodents were captured using Sherman traps (8 x 9 x 23 cm, H. B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, FL). During anesthesia, all rodents were examined for ectoparasites that were removed Fig. 1. Map of sites at Mérida City, Yucatán, where rodents were studied for ectoparasites.

Mites collected from the same host were stored in 70% ethanol and processed together (Estebanes-Gonzales 2005). Specimens were identified and photographed at 30X with the aid of a stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Microlmaging GmbH®) coupled to a digital camera (ScopePhoto 3.1®). Lice were photographed using a microscope (10/0.22X). Adult female E. echidninus (Standtmann 1963, Ahmed 2006) are large, robust, oval, and almost covered with a sculptured dorsal shield (Fig. 2A). The body is approximately 1,000 μm long and 690 μm wide. The dorsal shield is posteriorly rounded and rarely ornamented with transverse overlapping striations. It has 40 pairs of setae, 22 on the prosoma and 18 on the opisthosoma. Ventrally, E. echidninus has sclerotized sterna, epigynial, anal, and endapodal plates (Fig. 3A). The anterior of the sternal plate is almost straight and just behind the capitulum while its margin is concave and slightly covers the anterior margin of the epigynial plate. The postero-lateral corners of the plate project distinctly between coxae II and III. The sternal plate has three pairs of long pointed setae. The epigynial plate or genitoventral shield is widely expanded posterior to coxa IV and extended to the anal shield from which it is separated by a thin strip of integument. The posterior margin of the epigynial plate has a concavity closely matching the rounded anterior margin of the anal plate. The genitoventral plate has four pairs of setae. It is almost triangular with a convex anterior side. The longitudinal anal opening is guarded by two rectangular leaves surrounded with elevated oval integument. The anal plate has three setae; setae of the anterior pair are posterolateral to anal leaves and approximately half as long as the posterior unpaired seta behind the anal plate. The gnathosoma or capitulum consists of long basis capituli bearing median hypostome and two lateral pedipalps. Long well-developed tritosternum are between two triangular small folds of integument originating at the base of the basis capituli. The tritosternal base is longer than broad, undivided, and bifurcated into two long laciniae. The deutosternl groove is a longitudinal median groove on the ventral side of the basis capituli above the tritosternum. Chelicera consist of three Fig. 2. Dorsal surface of female E. echidninus. A.

The basal segment has one median ventral seta. The labium appears as an inverted isosceles triangle, its tip observed in front of the deutosternal groove of the basis capituli. Temporal regions of the head of P. spinulosa (Ewing 1935) are quadrangular, the post-antennal and posterolateral angles being little rounded, without eyes or ocular points. Segment II of the antenna is as long as wide. The front of the sternal plate is not rounded. The abdomen with well-defined ventral, lateral, and dorsal plates. Lateral plates are small, sub triangular. Paratergal plates 3-5 with only dorsal apical angle produced into points.

The adult female has two plates per segment. Without submarginal seta. The shape of the head of Ctenocephalides felis (Beaucournu and Menier 1998) is generally twice as long as the height. Spines 1 and 2 of the general comb, the first two spines, are approximately equal length. One or two bristles are on the lateral metanotal area. Tibiae of all six legs have five or six notches. One short stout bristle is in the interval between the postmedian and apical long bristles of the dorsal margin of the hind tibia. Results In total, we captured 161 rodents of Mus musculus (86) and Rattus rattus (75). Only 34 ectoparasites were removed from 12 rodents and identified because the rest were not well preserved. E. echidninus was most common (n = 27, Figs. 2- 3), followed by C. felis (n = 5, Fig. 4) and P. spinulosa (n = 2, Fig. 5). Of the 12 rodents infested with ectoparasites, three had serological evidence of infection by flavivirus. In the city zoo called “parque zoológico Centenario"" was E. echidninus on R. rattus with evidence of infection by yellow fever, Modoc, and Apoi viruses. Fig. 4.

Discussion We reported two new ectoparasites with potential to vector pathogens of humans. In previous studies in México, E. echidninus was found on Peromyscus pectoralis and Rattus sp. (Ramos-Casillas 2002, Estebanes-Gonzales 2005). E. echidninus is capable of transmitting the lethal apicomplexan protozoan Hepatozoon muris (Syn. Hepatozoon perniciosum) (Miller 1908, Smith 1996) and Junin virus (family Arenaviridae), the etiological agent of Argentinian haemorrhagic fever (McLay et al. 2014), to rats. Argentinian haemorrhagic fever is a lethal disease endemic to central Argentina, infecting principally agricultural workers (Kolokoltsova et al. 2014).

Identifying the presence and prevalence of this vector of arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance is necessary because it is common among rodents at Mérida City. In México, P. spinulosa has been collected on R. norvegicus and R. rattus (Mooser 1931) but was rare in our collection. In a previous study in Yucatán State, Polyplax was found on dogs but not on R. felis (Zavala-Velazquez et al. 2002). Polyplax spinulosa is a vector of Mycoplasma haemomuris (Syn. Haemobartonella muris), transmitted among Rattus sp., causing anemia (Crystal 1959, Harasawa et al. 2002). It also is an experimental vector of louse-borne typhus, Rickettsia prowazekii (Durden and Page 1991). Antibodies reactive with R. prowazekii were found in serum of patients with dengue-like illness at Nuevo León, México (Medina- Sanchez et al. 2005). For the first time, C. felis was found on R. rattus in Yucatán State. The flea is one of the most important ectoparasites throughout the world (Linardi and Santos 2012). In México, it is widely distributed on dogs and cats (Cruz-Vazquez et al. 2001, Hernandez-Valdivia et al. 2011, Canto et al. 2013). In Yucatán, C. felis is a vector of gram-negative bacteria Rickettsia felis (Zavala-Velazquez et al. 2002) that causes acute febrile diseases, some of which are self-limited for many patients but fatal to others (Zavala-Velazquez et al. 2000). In Yucatán, human cases have been confirmed by PCR and serological test (Zavala-Velazquez et al. 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006). C. felis is the main vector of the filarial parasite Acanthocheilonema reconditum (Napoli et al. 2014) that affects dogs and humans. Human infection has been characterized by subcutaneous nodules and ocular infection (Huynh et al. 2001). C. felis also is considered an intermediary host of Dipylidium caninum, a cestoda affecting dogs worldwide (Ramana et al. 2011). The parasite had been reported in dogs at Yucatán, México (Rodríguez-Vivas et al. 2011). Infection by D. caninum occurs when fleas are ingested and subsequently free cysticercoids that infect mammalian hosts. Humans are infected when they accidentally eat a flea. D. caninum has been found in children (Ramana et al. 2011, Narasimham et al. 2013). It is important to emphasize that Modoc and Apoi viruses are flaviviruses with no known vectors (Leyssen et al. 2002). Because we found E. echidninus with flaviviruses on rodents, the arthropods are likely vectors.

A traveller returning to Australia developed Zika virus infection, with fever, rash and conjunctivitis, with onset five days after a monkey bite in Bali, Indonesia. Flavivirus RNA detected on PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab was sequenced and identified as Zika virus. Although mosquito-borne transmission is also possible, we propose the bite as a plausible route of transmission. The litera- ture for non-vector transmissions of Zika virus and other flaviviruses is reviewed. Keywords: Zika virus, monkey bite, traveller transmitted via Aedes mosquito vectors, including Ae. aegypti (Boorman and Por- terfield, 1956). However, a non-vector- borne transmission was recently de- scribed, probable via sexual contact (Foy et al, 2001). Here we report the case of an acute Zika virus infection in a returned traveller following a monkey bite in Bali, Indonesia. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old Australian man pre- sented to Royal Darwin Hospital, Australia with fever and rash following a macaque monkey bite seven days earlier at the Ubud Monkey Forest in Bali, Indonesia. He trav- elled to Bali on vacation ten days before his presentation, and stayed for six days before his return to Darwin. The monkey bite oc- curred on his right torso through his cloth- ing, drawing blood and leaving several puncture marks (Fig 1). The wound was irrigated with water immediately after- INTRODUCTION Zika virus is a member of the fam- ily Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, first discovered in sentinel rhesus monkeys in Uganda in 1947 (Dick et al, 1952). In humans, it can produce a self-limited fe- brile illness similar to dengue fever, and has widespread distribution, including Africa, Southeast Asia (Olson et al, 1981), a well-described outbreak on Yap Island, Micronesia in 2007 (Duffy et al, 2009) and in the south Pacific (Roth et al, 2014) in 2012-2014. Genomic sequencing for the virus was completed in 2006 (Kuno and Chang, 2005) and polymerase chain reac- tion (PCR) assays have been developed for viral detection (Faye et al, 2008).

He sought local medical attention the following day, and was administered two doses of rabies vaccine. He developed fevers and myalgia two days after his return, five days following the bite. The next day he developed a gen- eralized maculopapular blanching rash over his face, arms, legs and torso, and on the morning of hospital presentation, developed bilateral conjunctivitis. He denied headache, meningeal, respiratory or urinary symptoms. He recalled mosquito bites whilst in Bali. There was no history of recent sexual contacts, intravenous drug use, water exposure or tick bites. There had been no other overseas travel in the previous twelve months. On examination his temperature was 37.9°C, with normal vital signs. He had a generalised, blanching maculopapular rash (Fig 1). There were no eschars, pe- techiae or genital ulcers. Conjunctival injection was noted bilaterally. There was no lymphadenopathy.

Serum and swabs of the bite site, conjunctivae and nasopharynx were sent to the national reference laboratory for viral PCR. He was treated with empirical intravenous acyclovir (12.5 mg/kg three times daily) pending herpesvirus B PCR. He was also given rabies immunoglobu- lin and rabies vaccine. His acyclovir was stopped on day 4 when his herpesvirus B PCR was reported negative, and with symptomatic improvement he was dis- charged. Flavivirus RNA was detected on PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab. This was sequenced and identified as Zika virus (Fig 2). Flavivirus PCR was negative in the serum and a swab sample taken from the bite site. All symptoms had resolved within two weeks. Dengue IgM and IgG serology were negative on both the ini- tial and convalescent samples taken two weeks later.

In an early experimental model by Boorman and Porter- field (1956), a rhesus mon- key became asymptom- atically infected from an Aedes aegypti mosquito, as evidenced by seroconver- sion. In non-epidemic set- tings, Zika virus is thought to circulate in a sylvatic cy- cle involving mosquitoes and a predominantly non- human primate reservoir (Haddow et al, 2012), with humans thought to serve as primary amplification hosts during epidemics (Haddow et al, 2012), such as those reported from Yap island in 2007 (Duffy et al, 2009) and French Polyne- sia in 2012-14 (Roth et al, 2014) Acute symptomatic Zika virus infection in the case reported here followed a monkey bite and we propose this as a potential route of trans- mission.

DISCUSSION Zika virus is generally accepted to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus has been isolated from Aedes africanus (Dick, 1952), Ae. aegypti (Boorman and Por- vector-borne transmission of Zika virus has been previously described: the source patient had returned to Colorado where the virus has never been described, the known vectors for Zika virus were absent, and the patient had not travelled to any countries known to harbour Zika virus (Foy et al, 2011). Exposure to bodily fluids through sexual intercourse was postulat- 0.2 Zika Virus infection following a Monkey Bite Vol 46 No. 3 May 2015 463 ed as the probable mode of transmission (Foy et al, 2011). Perinatal transmission of Zika virus has also been described (Bes- nard et al, 2014). This case demonstrates the presence of Zika virus in the human pharynx and Zika virus RNA has been identified in saliva from humans with symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (Besnard et al, 2014), consistent with the potential for transmission from primate bites. Other flaviviruses have also been demonstrated in saliva, including den- gue virus (Mizuno et al, 2007; Poloni et al, 2010). Non-vector transmission of other mosquito-borne flaviviruses has also been documented (Kuno, 2001), includ- ing several cases of dengue transmission following needlestick injuries, and a case of transmission through mucocutaneous exposure (Chen and Wilson, 2004). West Nile virus, another flavivirus, has also been demonstrated to infect humans without a mosquito vector, via direct con- tact with infected fluids, including blood transfusions and organ transplantation (Gould and Solomon, 2008). Zika virus is not endemic to Australia. Two other cases of imported Zika virus have been reported in Australia, acquired during travel to Indonesia (Kwong et al, 2013) and the Cook Islands (Pyke et al, 2014), respectively. In Australia, Aedes aegypti exist only in northern Queensland, but the importation of one of these cases to this region highlights the potential risk for introduction to Australia (Pyke et al, 2014). With millions of travellers visiting Southeast Asia each year, including areas where Zika virus is thought to be distrib- uted, there is likely a significant underdi- agnosis of Zika virus, given its self-limited nature, overlap of clinical manifestations with other viral syndromes, such as den- gue fever, and only limited availability of the test to detect Zika virus by PCR. Returned travellers with a similar viral syndrome may be misdiagnosed as hav- ing dengue fever, without being tested for other flaviviruses, although the macu- lopapular rash and conjunctivitis (Fig 1) differ from the blanching diffuse erythema without conjunctivitis more commonly seen in dengue infection. The absence of thrombocytopenia in this and other reports of Zika infection is also unusual in dengue infection. Tens of thousands of travellers from non-endemic areas visit Ubud and Sangeh Monkey Forests in Bali each year, and ma- caque bites are common (Wheatley, 1999). Transmission of Zika virus by monkey bite or other non-vector borne routes and attribution of illness to dengue or other infections may be more frequent than the absence of prior reports suggests. The implementation of molecular diagnos- tics for flaviviruses will allow for greater detection of this under-reported disease.

ISOLATION OF ILHEUS VIRUS FROM HUMAN BEINGS IN TRINIDAD, WEST INDIES* BY L. SPENCE, C. R. A N D E R S O N AND W. G. D O W N S t \ Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad Ilh6us virus was first isolated in 1944 by LAEMMERT and HU~HES (1947) from Aedes and Psorophora species collected in the vicinity of Ilh6us in the State of Bahia, Brazil. These workers demonstrated the presence of antibody to the virus in the serum of six persons, but no isolations of virus from human beings were reported. In 1953 and 1954, serum specimens were collected from residents of various parts of Trinidad by staff of the newly established Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory and tested in the neutralization test against 17 arthropod-borne viruses, including Ilh6us. Rates of immunity to Ilhdus were found to be high in the lowland, heavy rainfall, forested areas (DowNs et al., 1956a). At about the same time, the Bel6m Virus Laboratory (Brazil) con- ducted a serum survey by neutralization test among residents of 15 localities in the Amazon Valley. These sera also exhibited high rates of immunity to Ilh6us (CAusE¥ and THEILER, 1958). Following the immunity surveys in Trinidad, a study of the epidemiology of Ilh6us virus infection was undertaken by this laboratory (DowNs et al., 1956b). Attempts were made to isolate the virus from large numbers of forest mosquitoes, from birds and from the serum of persons residing in areas with a high incidence of Ilh6us immunity. Fever cases were seen twice weekly at a small clinic which was set up in 1955 in the town of Sangre Grande, in north-east Trinidad. Mosquitoes attracted to human bait were captured in various parts of the island, but principally in the Melajo and Rio Grande Forests, near Sangre Grande (AITKEN, 1958). Insect collections were made regularly by four to six men, who at the time they were first employed had no Ilh6us neutralizing antibodies in their sera. Weekly blood specimens from these mosquito catchers were inoculated routinely into mice in attempts to isolate virus, and a morning and afternoon oral temperature record was kept of each man. From September, 1954, to January, 1956, six strains of Ilh6us virus were isolated from forest mosquitoes of the genera Aedes and Psorophora (ANDERSON et al., 1956). Between January, 1956, and December, 1960, 15 more strains of the virus were isolated from mos- quitoes, one from a pool of Culex caudelli collected at Vega de Oropouche (near Sangre Grande) and the remainder from pools representing Aedes and Psorophora species caught e The studies and observations on which this paper is based were conducted w i t h the support and under the auspices of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme, and The Rockefeller Foundation. We are gratefdl to Dr. Harold Gentle, Government Medical Officer, Port-of-Spain, for referring the first case to us. L. SPENCE, C. R. ANDERSON .AND W. G. DOWNS 505 in the Rio Grande Forest and in Bush Bush Forest in eastern Trinidad. Ilh6us was also isolated from a resident of Port-of-Spain in 1955, from a mosquito catcher in 1956, and from a second mosquito catcher in 1957. I t is the purpose of this paper to discuss these three cases of Ilhe'us infection in human beings. REPORTS OF CASES Case 1 (TRVL 8768) T h e pa t i en t was a whi te housewife, aged 37.

She fell ill on July 27, 1955, with initial symptoms of fever, severe headache, restlessness and lassitude. These were followed by photophobia, joint anc~ muscle pains, incessant cough, nausea and constipation. She also experienced pain in the lower limbs on walking or bending; on the third day of illness she felt as though her hips were paralyzed, and turned from side to side in bed with great difficulty. At the end of the Ist week of illness the headache stopped but she developed diplopia. She also reported being upset by noise and on one or two occasions thought that she would become insane. Her temperature at onset of symptoms was 102""F. It rose to 103.8°F. on August 4 and finally settled on August 15. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality apart from the diplopia referred to'above. There was no neck rigidity. A lumbar puncture was not done. There was some congestion of the nasopharynx, and fine crepitations were heard on auscultation of the lungs. The liver and spleen were not palpable. On August 16 she showed tachycardia and signs of circulatory collapse, and was treated with cardiac stimulants. Convalescence was prolonged, but without sequelae. Blood specimens were collected from the patient on July 29 (TRVL 8768-1) and October 25, 1955, and again on November 22, 1956. Earlier reference to this case was made by DowNs et al. (1956b). Case 2 (TRVL 7554-87) This case occurred in an 18-year-old male, of mixed racial origin, who lived in Sangre Grande and worked as a mosquito catcher in the Rio Grande Forest on weekdays. On November 3, 1956, when weekly blood specimen No. 87 was collected, he was not ill and his temperature was normal. The records show no elevation of temperature above normal for 10 days before and several weeks after November 3. Case 3 (TRVL 2293-113) The patient was a 22-year-old male, of mixed racial origin, who lived in Arima and on weekdays worked as a mosquito catcher in the Rio Grande Forest. On August 26, 1957, he fell ill with fever (T. 99.4°F. on August 27), malaise and chills. He was forced to stop work and remain in bed. His illness lasted 1 week. Blood specimen No. 113 was collected on August 27, the second day of illness. ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUSES Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were done by the method described by CLARKE and CASALS (1958), and complement-fixation (CF) tests by the method of KERR (1952). The neutralizing capacity of each serum was determined according to techniques described by ANDERSON et al. (1956). The acute specimen from Case 1 (8768-1) and specimens 7554-87 and 2293-113 from the mosquito catchers were each inoculated on the day of collection into a group of 2-day-old white mice by the intracerebral (i.c.) route for virus isolation. The mice were observed for 21 days for signs of illness. Sick mice were killed and brain material was passaged i.c. to 2-day-old mice. By this method viruses were isolated from all three sera. Each virus was pathogenic for adult mice and passed readily through a bacteria-tight Seitz E K pad. Viruses 7554-87 and 2293-113 were successfully reisolated from portions of the original serum specimens which had been stored in a dry ice chest. The acute specimen from Case 1 was of small amount and had to be diluted 1:3 before reinoculation. This attempt to reisolate 8768 virus was unsuccessful, but after examining our records we have no reason to doubt the validity of the original isolation. 506 ISOLATION OF ILHEUS VIRUS IN TRINIDAD T h e three isolates were compared in HI , CF and neutralization tests with the original Brazilian strain of I1Mus virus as well as~two other strains ( T R V L 5800 and 6851) isolated in Tr in idad (ANDERSON et al., 1956), and found to be identical. SEROLOGICAL STUDIES With antigens prepared from the four Group B viruses known to he present in Trinidad --Ilh6us, St. Louis encephalitis, yellow fever and dengue---CF and HI studies were carried out on the two post-infection sera from Case I (the acute serum was insufficient for testing) and on specimens from the two mosquito catchers collected both before and after those from which virus was isolated. It should be noted that, before infection with Ilh6us, all three patients had been vaccinated against yellow fever with 17D vaccine. The results of the CF and HI tests are shown in Table I. The two post-infection sera from Case l had high antibody titres to all four viruses. For Cases 2 and 3, there is a rise in antibody titre to each virus between pre-infection and post-infection specimens. TABLE I.

T h e results of neutralization tests with three strains of Ilh~us and Trinidadian St. Louis virus are shown in Table I I . T h e post-infection sera f rom Case 1 neutralized the pat ient 's own virus and also, to a lesser degree, Brazilian Ilh6us and St. Louis viruses. In the one test done on the acute specimen f rom this case, undiluted serum was mixed with 8768 virus diluted 2 x 10 -5 and inoculated into mice i.c. in 0.03-ml. amounts, each containing 50 MLDs0 of Virus; none of the mice died. Unfortunately, there was not enough serum for further testing. With Cases 2 and 3, the post-infection specimens neutralized Ilh~us, St. Louis and the homologous viruses to a greater degree than did the pre-infection specimens (Table II) . L. SPENCE, C. R.

(1956). Since for Case 2 the fitre of Brazilian Ilh6us was 1.1 dex* lower in the pre-infection serum than in bovalbumin diluent while the drop in titre between pre-infection and post-infect- ion specimens was only 2 dex, additional neutralization tests were done using the homologous virus and eight sera from this individual. Th e results are shown in Table I I I . I t can be seen that the titres of the virus in presence of pre-infection serum are lower in every instance than the titres in bovalbumin diluent. The fall in titre between pre-infection and post- infection specimens ranges from less than 1 dex to 4 .0 dex in the several tests, the greatest difference occurring when sera were inactivated and the serum-virus mixtures inoculated into mice by the intraperitoneal route. DISCUSSION The investigations on Case 1 were hampered by the inadequate volume of the acute specimen. Although the virus isolated from this specimen was identified as Ilh6us, the post-infection sera were not specific for Ilh6us in H I and CF tests. The i r high antibody titres do , however, suggest recent infection by a Group B virus. With Case 2 we have the interesting circumstance, in a human being, of circulation of virus in the absence of clinical symptoms but the presence of demonstrated virus inhibitor. Whether this inhibitor is in fact specific virus neutralizing antibody or a non-specific virus neutralizing substance has not been clarified. A serum collected from this individual shortly before No. 87 was taken, neutralized both dengue and yellow fever viruses. * Dex = decimal exponent; see J. B. S. Haldane (1960).

HI tests showed a Group B response, and the post-infection sera neutralized both Ilhfus and St. Louis. Although dengue and yellow fever could have been excluded on the basis of the CF test, virus isolation was essential for distinguishing between Ilhfus and St. Louis infections. It may be noted here that a serum collected from this mosquito catcher shortly before infection with Ilh6us was partially protective against yellow fever (two mice surviving out of six inoculated i.c. with 660 LD50 of virus) but negative for dengue. The serological diagnosis of Ilh6us infection in Trinidad is difficult because of the cross- reactions that occur with the four Group B viruses. In their investigation of the serological reactions in yellow fever, THEILER and CASALS (1958) showed that in cases of yellow fever occurring secondary to earlier Group B virus infection, the production of HI and CF anti- bodies is both massive and very rapid. They found also that in such cases there is no speci- ficity in the patterns developed and that often the highest antibodies are heterologous, whereas in primary yellow fever infections the pattern of CF antibodies is remarkably specific. Sero- logical reactions in these reported Ilh6us cases are in support of this thesis, the response in Case 2 being the kind associated with secondary infection, while the response in Case 3 is more like that of primary infection. Owing to the wide-spread distribution of antibodies to dengue, St. Louis and yellow fever (both natural and post 17D vaccination) viruses in the Trinidad population, primary infections with Ilh6us virus are not likely to be encountered frequently. Virus isolation and identification will therefore be necessary for accurate diag- nosis in the majority of cases. CAtrSE¥ et al. (1961) have reported two cases of Ilh6us infection in human beings, one in 1957 and one in 1959, both established by virus isolation. Each was a mild illness. It is not possible, however, to draw any conclusions as to the typical clinical picture produced by infection with Ilh6us. In our experience, limited to the three cases reported from Trini- dad, we have seen one subclinical infection, one mild febrile illness and one severe febrile illness going on possibly to encephalitis and my0carditis. These observations are in keeping with those of SOUTHAM and MOORE (1951) who describe symptoms produced in cancer L. SPENCE, C. R. ANDERSON AND W. G. DOWNS 509 patients inoculated with Ilh~us virus. The virus infected nine of the 19 patients inoculated. In three patients it caused mild encephalitis but in the others it produced no symptoms. SUMMARY Three strains of Ilhdus virus were isolated from human beings in Trinidad: One of these isolations was made from a female resident of Port-of-Spain who suffered a severe febrile illness. The other two strains were isolated from mosquito catchers who worked in the forests of eastern Trinidad. One of these men had a mild febrile illness at the time of the isolation, and the other was in good health. Th e serological reactions in these three cases of Ilh~us infection are reported.

In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe encephalitis case in a farm wife was diagnosed as tick-borne encephalitis. Serological examination of paired sera showed a rise of neutralization (NT) antibody titer to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. A sero-epizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood of sentinel dogs and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-related viruses. Sequence analysis of envelope protein gene identi®ed one of the isolates as the same subtype as Russian spring summer encephalitis (Far-Eastern TBE) virus. The results provide the evidence that TBE is endemic in a certain area of Japan. # 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The family Flaviviridae includes nearly 70 antigenically distinct viruses, many of which cause severe illness in humans and animals [1, 2]. Ecologically, they are divided into mosquito- and tick-borne viruses. The latter comprise a complex of viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), louping ill, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest fever, and Powassan encephalitis virus [3, 4] (Table 1). They were often called TBE complex because of antigenic similarities. Like mosquito-borne yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, TBE virus represents one of the major human pathogenic ¯aviviruses causing thousands of cases of severe neurological disease per year. TBE is thus a signi®cant public health problem in endemic areas of Asia and Europe. Two subtypes of TBE virus, Western (central European) subtype and Far-Eastern subtype (prototype; Russian spring summer encephalitis virus strain Sofjin) are prevalent on the Eurasian Continent [5, 6]. The latter subtype is known to be highly pathogenic to humans with a mortality rate of about 30% or more [7]. This article gives brief information of TBE in general and the epidemiological survey results of TBE found recently in Japan.

Transmission cycle of TBE virus in nature TBE virus circulates in nature as represented in Fig. 1. The virus is passed from adult ticks to eggs by transovarial transmission and is further transmitted trans- stadially from one stage to the next. Persistence of the virus in nature requires a large population of both small mammals and ticks. The virus foci are very stable for years unless the ecological conditions are changed either by man or nature. The virus can be transmitted to man or other hosts by larvae, nymphs or adult ticks. Larvae and nymphs acquired the virus from infected small mammals and birds. Vector tick species of TBE virus Western subtype is known as Ixodes ricinus and that of Far-Eastern subtype as Ixodes persulcatus. But other species of ticks can serve as the vector of TBE virus. Besides the main transmission route by the tick bite, humans may acquire the infection by drinking raw milk from goats, sheep and cows. 3. History and present epidemiology Illness of the TBE Far Eastern subtype was ®rst reported in Russia in 1937 during an epidemic in southern Far East, and the causing virus was isolated from the brain of an encephalitis patient [8]. Similar encephalitis was described in Czechoslovakia in 1948 during an epidemic in Central Bohemia, and TBE virus Western subtype was isolated [9]. TBE cases are reported in Europe and north Asia. In the 1990 s, total annual TBE numbers were 6000±10 000 cases among which 5000±7000 cases have been reported from Russia [10]. The largest number of cases in recent years was observed in the Ural and in western Siberia where incidence rates reached 2.7±6.5 and 3.0±4.0 per 100 000, respectively [11, 12]. In Fig. 1. Transmission cycle of TBE virus. I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±90 83 the 1950s and 1960s, cases occurred mainly in rural areas, but in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, more than 70% of reported cases were in urban dwellers [12]. 4. Background information of TBE in Hokkaido, Japan Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, is located close to the Maritime Province of Siberia in Far Eastern Russia, in which TBE is prevalent. Both areas, once connected by land, share the same biogeographical and ecological environments. Ixodes persulcatus, vector tick of TBE virus in Siberia, is a predominant species in Hokkaido; and some rodent species, reservoir hosts of the virus, are also common in both areas. From the viewpoint of an ecological setting for the virus, it is not surprising that TBE virus of Far Eastern subtype is endemic to Hokkaido. The presence of scattered TBE foci had been suspected in the area from previous seroepidemiological surveys in 1978 using cattle sera [13]. In 1993, a case of human viral encephalitis was diagnosed as TBE in Kamiiso, the southern part of Hokkaido. The following are the results of case ®ndings of TBE, seroepidemiological survey, virus isolation and the sequence analysis of the virus envelope (E) protein gene, in order to demonstrate that TBE is endemic in Japan. 5. Clinical ®ndings On 27 October 1993, a dairy farmer's wife in the town of Kamiiso suddenly suered a febrile illness with a temperature of 398C. She was hospitalized on the third day after the onset of illness. Double vision was reported on the second day, convulsions on the ®fth day. She was under pulmotor from day ®ve to twenty. Remaining motor paralysis of the arms and neck was present three years later. Cerebrospinal ¯uid examination at acute and convalescent phases clearly showed that she suered from encephalitis or encephalomyelitis of viral origin [14, 15]. The patient's dairy farm was located in the town of Kamiiso in the Oshima district, Hokkaido (Fig. 2). Four farms were distributed there within a 1.0 km radius. The area was deforested 50 years ago. The sera and cerebrospinal ¯uid were examined by ELISA for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (Table 2). ELISA IgG titer for JE virus increased signi®cantly from acute phase to convalescent phase. However, ELISA IgM titer essential in JE diagnosis was negative. Therefore, another ¯avivirus infection was suspected as the cause of the encephalitis in this case and a more speci®c neutralization test (NT) was performed including Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus strain JaGAr-01, Negishi virus isolated in 1948 in Japan [16], Apoi virus isolated from rodents in Hokkaido in 1954 [17], and Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus strain Sofjin. NT antibody titers increased signi®cantly to RSSE virus at acute and convalescent I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±9084 phases among the ¯aviviruses tested. The results indicated that the patient was infected with a TBE-related virus [14, 18]. 6. Epidemiological study in 1994 In 1994, a serological examination of animal sera was conducted for cattle and dogs kept on farms of a case study area to con®rm that the virus is prevalent endemically in the aected area, and to examine cow milk as a possible source of infection. Positive antibody was not detected in 54 cattle sera collected from the farm of the patient and an adjacent farm, suggesting no connection of cow milk with infection source. Dogs in the area were selected as indicator animals based Fig. 2. Geographical location of a case study area, Kamiiso (R).

Sera of nine dogs from four farms in the aected area were collected in July 1994, and NT titers were determined to JE virus, RSSE and Langat viruses of tick-borne encephalitis complex (Table 3). Eight out of nine dogs showed signi®cantly higher titer to RSSE virus than JE virus. Although titer to Langat virus was lower than RSSE virus, it was higher than JE virus. The results showed that the TBE-related virus was prevalent in the area. Comparison of NT titers to three ¯aviviruses demonstrated that Langat virus could substitute as assay virus instead of the highly pathogenic RSSE virus. A serological survey was extended to the residents of the aected area. Five human sera, including four family members of the patient and a neighbouring farmer, were tested. Negative titer (<1:20) was obtained from four family members to Langat virus. However, the neighbouring farmer's serum had speci®c NT titer to RSSE virus (1:100). He had suered severe encephalitis clinically suspected as JE 35 years ago and was hospitalized for two months. He claimed to have suered motor paralysis of the neck for one year. 7. Epidemiological survey using sentinel dogs in 1995 In 1995, 10 sentinel dogs were kept in the area in a free-living environment and the serum samples were collected once a week from April to July. NT titers of the dog sera to Langat virus were determined and virus isolation was carried out (Table 4). On 22 April all 10 dogs had a negative antibody to Langat virus. Two animals converted to positive on 4 May, three on 13 May and ®ve on 27 May. The results clearly showed that the virus was prevalent in the area in 1995.

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±9086 blood was inoculated into suckling mice via an intracerebral route. Three viral strains were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs Nos. 5, 8 and 9 which were obtained seven days prior to the sero-converted day. The virus strains from dogs Nos 5, 8 and 9 were designated as Oshima-3-6, -5-10 and -5-11, respectively. Antigenicities of the virus isolates were examined by IFA test using monoclonal antibodies supplied by Dr F. X. Heinz at the University of Vienna, Austria [19± 21]. Three of the isolates showed high titers to TBE-complex-speci®c 2E7 and TBE-type-speci®c 7G7 monoclonal antibodies [15]. The viral strains isolated were identi®ed as TBE-related virus. 8. Characterization of the virus isolates Sequence and phylogenic analysis of one of the isolates, Oshima-5-10 strain, was performed targeting the E-protein gene. The whole E-protein gene was ampli®ed by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. The sequence of Oshima virus was compared with those of TBE complex viruses (Table 5). The nucleotide identities of Oshima virus with RSSE (Far Eastern subtype) and Western tick-borne encephalitis (WTBE) were 95.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Oshima virus showed extremely high identities of the amino acid sequences with RSSE (99.0%) and WTBE (95.8%). Oshima virus was grouped in RSSE subtype. 9. Discussion This article describes a general introduction to TBE and the epidemiology of TBE in Hokkaido, Japan.

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±90 87 1993 was diagnosed as TBE since NT titers of the patient sera were higher to TBE(RSSE) virus than other ¯aviviruses. NT titers of paired sera also increased from acute to convalescent phases to TBE virus and very low to JE virus. The patient was suspected of having acquired the virus infection in the area, and the virus may have been indigenous to the area for many years. The above assumption was made for the following reasons. (1) The patient had no history of travel abroad. (2) In the years 1994 and 1995, virus activity was clearly demonstrated in the dog population by serological examination and virus isolation. (3) The neighbouring farmer with speci®c TBE antibody was probably infected with TBE virus 35 years ago when he suered from encephalitis. (4) In 1978 we had performed a serological survey of TBE virus in Hokkaido using cattle sera and found positive areas at several foci [13]. (5) TBE virus has been shown to be endemic in certain foci for many years due to its ecological nature. The virus can be maintained in the tick trans-stadially and transovarially, and the reservoir animals are indigenous rodents whose migration is very limited. However, the above assumption that the virus may have been indigenous for many years has to be veri®ed further. Dogs and/or sentinel animals were found to be superior indicators for TBE virus survey. A high positive antibody rate was detected in dog sera from the aected area. The time of the virus activity could be monitored by consecutive testing of the sera. The viruses were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs. The viremic period of dogs was reported to be seven days before the neutralizing antibodies were ®rst detected in the serum from the infected animals [22]. No clinical signs developed in the experimentally infected dogs or in our sentinel dogs [22]. The isolated virus strains were identi®ed as TBE-related virus from the results of the reaction pattern with monoclonal antibodies, and one of the isolates was shown to be RSSE (Far-Eastern) subtype virus from sequence analysis of the E- protein gene.

The E-protein gene of Oshima 5-10 showed the closest relationship with RSSE virus. TBE virus may be endemic to areas other than the case study area in Japan. The dog sera from another district in Hokkaido showed a positive antibody to TBE virus [23]. I. persulcatus ticks were reported as a principal vector species of RSSE virus in the far eastern part of Russia. However, our tick collection study shows that I. ovatus is the predominant species in the case study area and may be the vector tick in this area [23]. Since I. ovatus tick is a common species all over Japan, epidemiological surveys should also extend to Honshyu, the main island of Japan, to reveal the extent of TBE endemicity. These ®ndings should prompt physicians to consider TBE as one of the causes of viral encephalitis and to dierentiate it from JE in an area such as Japan. JE is prevalent in many Asian countries but TBE may not have been reported because of similar clinical symptoms and a high degree of cross-reactivity in serological tests. Prompt preventive measures must be established in Japan by further studies to specify endemic areas and to develop a vaccine strategy against the prevalent TBE-related virus.

Non-suppurative encephalitis and mild degeneration and necrosis were identified in the brain and cerebellum, and Usutu virus antigen and RNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, respectively. The two cases reported here represent the most western distribution of clinical disease in birds due to Usutu virus in Europe. � 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group in the family Flaviviridae (Poidinger et al., 1996). The virus is primarily transmitted by ornithophilic mosquitoes among avian reservoir hosts (Nikolay et al., 2011). Prior to 1996, USUV had been isolated from some mosquito and bird species in Africa, but had never been associated with clinical signs or episodes of mass mortality (Nikolay et al., 2011). In early autumn 1996, an outbreak of wild bird deaths occurred in the provinces of Florence and Pistoia, in the Tuscany region of Italy. Mostly Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) were affected and USUV was identified as the causative agent (Weissenböck et al., 2013). In 2001, USUV emerged in the region of Vienna, eastern Austria, where it caused an epidemic among birds of the orders Passeriformes and Strigiformes (Weissenböck et al., 2002). About 10 years after its emergence, USUV has become endemic in Central Europe; the virus was detected in Hungary (Budapest, 2005), Switzerland (Zurich, 2006) and in northern Italy (Milan, 2006) associated with episodes of mortality in birds (Bakonyi et al., 2007; Manarolla et al., 2010; Steinmetz et al., 2011). In sum- mer 2011, USUV emerged in South-West Germany, demonstrating further spread of the virus to the north of the continent (Becker et al., 2012). In the present study, we identified a bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula, Order Passeriformes) and a great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major; Order Piciformes) with neurological signs associated with USUV. Clinical and post mortem examinations were performed on a 3-year-old bullfinch held in captivity for its entire lifespan and a wild, adult, great spotted woodpecker, found 4 km from each other in the Meuse Valley between the towns of Namur (50.4667�N, 4.8667�E) and Huy (50.5167�N, 5.2333�E), Belgium. The two birds were hospitalised on 15 and 20 October 2012, respectively. They exhibited non-specific clinical signs (immobility, ruffled plumage, half-closed eyes and anorexia), along with severe neurological signs (depression, incoordination, inability to fly, jerky movements, torticollis and nystagmus). After neurological signs had worsened throughout the 36–48 h of observation, the birds were killed humanely. Both birds were in good post mortem condition and had no significant gross lesions. The cerebrum, cerebellum and liver of the bullfinch were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and pro- cessed routinely for histopathology. In a few areas of the cortex and brainstem, there was multifocal neuronal degeneration and perineuronal clustering of glial cells (Fig. 1A). Cerebellar lesions in- cluded degeneration of Purkinje cells, formation of glial shrubber- ies, lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffs, and mild degeneration and necrosis at the molecular–granular layer interface (Fig. 1B). There was individual necrosis of hepatocytes surrounded by small http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.10.017&domain=pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.10.017 mailto:daniel.desmecht@ulg.ac.be http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.10.017 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10900233 http://www.elsevier.com/locate/tvjl Fig. 1.

Using a USUV-specific monoclonal antibody (Becker et al., 2012), USUV-specific antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the brain of the bullfinch (Fig. 1C). Nucleic acids were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), either at 70 �C from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of the brain from the bullfinch, or at room temperature from unfixed brain from the great spotted woodpecker that had been stored at �70 �C. USUV-specific amplicons were detected using a reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR protocol (StepOnePlus real time PCR sys- tem; Applied Biosystems) targeting a 91 base pair region of the non-structural protein (NSP) 1 gene (Jöst et al., 2011). Independent examination of paraffin-embedded tissues from the bullfinch by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Südufer, Germany, yielded similar results. A one-step pan-flavivirus RT-PCR targeting a segment of the NSP 5 gene (Johnson et al., 2010) was performed and the PCR product (203 base pairs) was sequenced; the sequence was identical to that of all European USUV strains sequenced to date (GenBank JQ219843). In this study, clinical, pathological and molecular investigations demonstrated that the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker with clinical disease in Belgium were infected with USUV. The features of these cases were the occurrence of disease due to USUV in two novel avian hosts and evidence of further spread of the virus in North-western Europe, about 300 km west of the 2011 episode in Germany. USUV circulated at low levels in mosquitoes 12 months before outbreaks of disease were observed in wild birds in Germany (Jöst et al., 2011). The probability that a wild diseased or dead bird reaches a wildlife surveillance facility, where a suspicion of USUV infection might be established and confirmed by laboratory testing, is lower in rural and forested areas, such as Namur and Huy, where diseased wild birds are quickly eliminated by scavenger species, than in urbanised areas (Steinmetz et al., 2011). This may explain, at least in part, why the previous European USUV outbreaks were mostly detected in urban areas. On the basis of the spatial distribu- tion of the 2011 and 2012 outbreak of USUV infection in wild birds in Germany (Becker et al., 2012), the occurrence of sporadic cases in other areas of North-western Europe could herald further out- breaks of disease in wild birds in the region.

Even though TBE is a notifiable disease in Croatia, there is a significant lack of information in regard to vector tick identification, distribution as well as TBE virus prevalence in ticks or animals. The aim of our study was to identify and to investigate the viral prevalence of TBE virus in ticks removed from red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses hunted in endemic areas in northern Croatia and to gain a better insight in the role of wild ungulates, especially red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the maintenance of the TBE virus in the natural cycle. We identified 5 tick species (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes hexagonus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor reticulatus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus) removed from 40 red foxes. However, TBE virus was isolated only from adult I. ricinus and I. hexagonus ticks showing a viral prevalence (1.6%) similar to or higher than reported in endemic areas of other European countries. Furthermore, 2 positive spleen samples from 182 red deer (1.1%) were found. Croatian TBE virus isolates were roatia genetically analyzed, and they were shown to be closely related, all belonging to the European TBE virus subgroup. However, on the basis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis, 2 clusters were identified. Our results show that further investigation is needed to understand the clustering of isolates and to identify the most common TBE virus reservoir hosts in Croatia. Sentinel surveys based on wild animal species would give a better insight in defining TBE virus-endemic and possible risk areas in Croatia. ntroduction Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a growing public health prob- em and the most important viral tick-borne disease in Europe. uring the past decades, TBE has been showing an increase in ecorded human incidence levels throughout Europe (Süss, 2008; ansfield et al., 2009). The increase has mostly been connected ith climate change (Lindgren, 1998; Estrada-Peña et al., 2012) as ell as with human behaviour (Randolph and Rogers, 2000). The ausative agent of TBE belongs to the genus Flavivirus, family Fla- iviridae. The viral genome consists of a single-stranded positive ense RNA which encodes a polyprotein that is post-translationally leaved into 3 structural and 7 non-structural proteins (Fauquet t al., 2005). Currently, 12 virus species have been identified as embers of the tick-borne flavivirus group. According to their ∗ Corresponding author. Tel.: +385 1 6123 645; fax: +385 1 6190 841.

Within the mam- malian tick-borne flavivirus group, some members closely related to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), such as louping ill virus, Powassan virus, and the deer tick virus, may cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans (Gould and Solomon, 2008). TBE is mostly characterized by a biphasic course of clinical disease in humans. The first stage (accompanied by flu-like symptoms) appears 4–28 days after a tick bite and usually lasts 2–10 days. The second stage appears after a symptom-free interval of 1–21 days with a clinical spectrum range from mild meningitis to severe encephalitis with or without myelitis and spinal paralysis (Gritsun et al., 2003; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008). The mortality rate is 1–2% in Europe and 6% to even 40% in Asia (Gritsun and Gould, 2003; Lesnicar et al., 2003). Genetically, 3 subtypes of TBEV have been recognized, the European (TBEV-Eu), the Far Eastern (TBEV-Fe), and the Siberian (TBEV-Sb) subtypes (Ecker et al., 1999; Süss, 2011). The amino acid differences of isolates within the same subtype may be up to 2.0% dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.11.016 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/1877959X http://www.elsevier.com/locate/ttbdis http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.11.016&domain=pdf mailto:jemersic@veinst.hr dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.11.016 8 ick-bo w e T e a 2 T r T g v V t r i T b P b n t 2 t s f p d e 1 r t r v o f i T r l d t e 2 z d M C v M 1 ( 1 n m L. Jemeršić et al. / Ticks and T hile isolates from different subtypes may differ by 5–6% (Ecker t al., 1999; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008). The main vector of TBEV-Eu is the tick Ixodes ricinus, whereas BEV-Fe and TBEV-Sb are mostly transmitted by I. persulcatus. Nev- rtheless, recent findings indicate that in some parts of Europe nd Asia both tick species occur and transmit TBE virus (Randolph, 001; Süss et al., 2002; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008; Süss, 2011). BEV-Eu isolates identified in I. ricinus are genetically more closely elated to each other, whereas isolates belonging to TBEV-Fe and BEV-Sb subtypes isolated from I. persulcatus show a much higher enetic diversity. The higher genetic diversity of the latter two iral subtypes indicates a longer evolutionary period (Lindquist and apalahti, 2008). I. ricinus is distributed throughout Europe and may feed on more han 300 different animal species, including mammals, birds, and eptiles, as well as humans. Subclinically infected hosts become mmune for life (Leschnik et al., 2002). During the life cycle of ticks, BEV survives the moults, and it is transmitted transovarially or y close co-feeding of ticks on the same host (Labuda et al., 1997; feffer and Dobler, 2010; Randolph, 2011). Host preference varies etween different tick life stages. Larvae feed on animals of all sizes, ymphs mostly on medium-sized and large animals, whereas adult icks exclusively feed on medium-sized and large animals (Süss, 011). An infected adult female tick may occasionally (less than 0.5%) ransmit the virus transovarially (Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008), o during an average of 3 years that takes I. ricinus to develop rom one generation to the next (Gray, 1991), the virus may ersist. TBE is endemic in the continental regions of Croatia in a patchy istribution with an average of 20 human cases per year (Mulic t al., 2011). The highest peaks of incidence were recorded from 993 to 1996 and in 2004. The lowest case incidence (n = 11) was eported in 2007. Most cases of human TBE followed an I. ricinus ick bite (Mulic et al., 2011). Since limited data are available as to possible TBEV transmission outes, vectors and reservoir hosts, genetic characteristics of TBE irus and viral prevalence in ticks and animals in Croatia, we based ur investigation on identifying and investigating ticks removed rom red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) hunted in known TBE endemic areas n Croatia that share the same habitat with the main reservoirs of BEV, rodents. Our investigation also included the testing of hunted ed deer (Cervus elaphus) from areas in eastern Croatia where the atest TBE cases were recorded in 2009 and 2010, since published ata show that wild ungulates can be successfully used as sen- inels for recognizing TBE-endemic areas (Labuda et al., 2002; Carpi t al., 2007; Roelandt et al., 2010; Kiffner et al., 2011; Klaus et al., 012). Furthermore, we present the first results of genetic characteri- ation and diversity of TBEV isolates delivered from ticks and red eer in Croatia. aterials and methods ollection of ticks from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) Ticks (n = 371) were removed from 40 hunted red foxes (V. ulpes) originating from 7 different counties (Table 1), Sisak- oslavina (centroid coordinates 45.7◦N, 17.2◦E), Zagreb (45.9◦N, 6.4◦E), Krapina-Zagorje (46.1◦N, 16.1◦E), Pozega-Slavonia 45.3◦N, 17.7◦E), Varazdin (46.3◦N, 16.6◦E), Karlovac (45.6◦N, 5.7◦E), and Bjelovar-Bilogora County (45.8◦N, 16◦9′E), in the orthern part of Croatia (Fig. 1). The foxes were all adult ani- als, 2–7 years of age (according to their morphology and dental rne Diseases 5 (2014) 7– 13 characteristics). They were shot from the 1st of March to the 30th of June 2011. Ticks were microscopically identified by species and develop- mental stage. After identification, ticks were washed in 70% ethanol and left in distilled water for 5 min. They were grouped in pools according to the fox they were removed from, to species, to devel- opmental stage, feeding status (fed or unfed), and gender. The pool size varied from 1 to 10 ticks per pool. The ticks were frozen and kept at −80 ◦C in plastic vials until RNA extraction. Collection of spleen samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus) Spleen samples were collected from hunted red deer (n = 182) from 2 TBE-endemic regions in the north-eastern Croatian counties Vukovar-Srijem (44.9◦N, 19.1◦E) and Osijek-Baranja (45.9◦N, 19.1◦E). The samples were collected during the hunting seasons 2010–2011 and 2011–2012. The deer were 1–11 years of age (aver- age: 4.5 years), and they were all negative for bovine viral diarrhoea virus and border disease virus (which are members of the Pestivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family). The samples (each approxi- mately 5 cm3 in size) were frozen at −80 ◦C until PCR procedures were carried out. Reverse transcription and nested PCR Prior to RNA extraction, ticks were ground using a mortar and pestle with addition of quartz sand (Kemika, Croatia) and homoge- nized in a buffer containing guanidine thiocyanate (Sigma–Aldrich, USA). Spleen samples originating from deer were also homogenized under the same conditions. Total RNA extraction was carried out by using RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, USA). Reverse transcription was accomplished by GoScript Reverse Tran- scription System (Promega, USA) as described by the manufacturer. The PCR protocol was based on the amplification of a sequence (178 bp) within the 5′UTR, partially covering the coding gene of the capsid protein of the viral RNA as described by Schrader and Süss (1999) and modified by Wójcik-Fatla et al. (2011). The reaction was performed in a PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) under conditions described by Wójcik-Fatla et al. (2011). Both PCR reactions were performed in a 25-�l reaction mixture (Invitrogen, USA) containing the follow- ing reagents: 1 × PCR buffer (with 1.5 mM MgCl2), 1.25 U Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase, 200 �M of each dNTP, 400 nM of each primer, nuclease-free water, and 3 �l of cDNA sample or initial PCR prod- uct. The PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using a UV transilluminator system (Vilber Lour- mat, France) after electrophoresis in 3.0% agarose gel (Sigma, USA). Phylogenetic analysis PCR products of representative TBEV isolates derived from ticks and red deer were purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System, Promega, USA). Sequencing was per- formed on ABI 3730XL (Applied Biosystems, USA) with BigDyeTM terminator kit (Macrogen Inc., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Program BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used for starting comparisons of sequences characterized in this study with reference sequences in GenBank. Sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW (1.6) incorporated in MEGA5 soft- ware (Tamura et al., 2011) with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and tree formation carried out on the basis of the Neighbour- Joining (NJ) method with p-distances for nucleotide and the http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi L.

Only nymphal and adult ticks were removed from red fox arcasses. Five different tick species were identified (Table 2) ith the great majority belonging to I. ricinus [93.2%; 95% onfidence interval (CI): 90–93%], found in all investigated ounties or Ixodes hexagonus (4.6%; 95% CI: 2.8–7.2%), found in agreb, Varazdin, and Krapina-Zagorje Counties, respectively. ed areas present hunting grounds where red foxes were hunted (Sisak-Moslavina: Bjelovar-Bilogora: VII), while doted areas represents the counties where samples Haemaphysalis punctata represented 1.3% (95% CI: 0.5–3.1%) and was found in Pozega-Slavonia County. Two ticks were identified as Dermacentor reticulatus (0.5%; 95% CI: 0.2–1.9%) in Sisak-Moslavina County, and one nymph belonged to the species Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.05–1.5%) in Zagreb County. Altogether, 52.3% (95% CI: 47.2–57.3%) of ticks were adult females 35.5% of which were fed and 64.5% were unfed. Male adult ticks represented 45.5% (95% CI: 40.5–50.6%) of all removed ticks, whereas only 8 ticks were nymphs (2.2%; 95% CI: 1.1–4.2%). The nymph/adult ratio was 1:45. TBEV findings and phylogenetic analysis RT-PCR-positive results were obtained from 6 adult pools (Table 3). Most of the positive samples belonged to I. ricinus (83%; 95% CI: 43.6–96.9%), while 17% of the positive ticks were I. hexagonus (95% CI: 3.0–56.3%). In total, the minimal viral 10 L.

The red foxes with removed BEV-positive ticks, I. ricinus and I. hexagonus, were hunted in arazdin County near the city of Varazdin (pools 23500-1, 23500-2, 3500-3, 23371-1, and 24559-3) and near the village Sveti Djurd pool 23371-1). The only fox from which positive ticks were emoved (pool 24805-3), but had not been hunted in Varazdin ounty, was shot near Vrbovec city within Zagreb County. TBEV RNA was also detected in 2 out of 182 spleen samples 1.1%; 95% CI: 0.3–3.0%) collected from hunted red deer. The isolate BEV/1954-Tikves/Cro* (ENA: HE972519) was derived from a 4 to -year-old female red deer, approximately 95 kg of weight, shot on he 17th of December 2011 in Osijek-Baranja County. TBEV isolate BEV/2317-Strosinci/Cro* (ENA: HE972518) was derived from a -year-old female red deer, approximately 83 kg of weight, shot n the 16th of January 2012 in Vukovar-Srijem County. All genetically analyzed TBEV isolates described in this study Fig. 2) are closely related to each other and members of the uropean TBEV subgroup. Isolates derived from ticks (I. ricinus and . hexagonus) from Varazdin County were genetically identical, also o the isolate TBEV/1954-Tikves/Cro* derived from the red deer riginating from Osijek-Baranja County. In addition, the isolate etected in ticks from Zagreb County (TBEV/24805-VRB3/Cro) was enetically strongly related to the isolate TBEV/2317-Strosinci/Cro* erived from a red deer from Vukovar-Srijem County. All isolates ere genetically closely related to known TBEV isolates from other uropean countries (Germany, Austria, Finland, Czech Republic). On the amino acid level, similar results were obtained (Fig. 3). owever, our tick isolates from Varazdin County (TBEV/23500- Z2/Cro, TBEV/23500-VZ3/Cro, and TBEV/23371-SDj1/Cro) and the ed deer isolate TBEV/1954-Tikves/Cro* differed from the isolate rom Zagreb County (TBEV/24805-VRB3/Cro) and red deer isolate BEV/2317-Strosinci/Cro* by the substitution of glycine for serine n position 13 of the capsid protein. iscussion While central and northern European countries report a 400% ncrease of TBE human cases from 1974 to 2003 and a further ncrease of morbidity in endemic European countries during the BEV/23371-SDJ1/Cro HE972516 Varazdin County BEV/24559-VZ4/Cro Varazdin County BEV/24805-VRB3/Cro HE972517 Zagreb County past 2 decades, indicating TBE is becoming an emerging disease in Europe (Süss, 2008a, 2011; Mansfield et al., 2009; Randolph, 2008; Roelandt et al., 2010), the case incidence of TBE in Croatia (with an average of 20 patients per year) has been rather stabile (Mulic et al., 2011; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008; Süss, 2011). Even though TBE is a notifiable disease in Croatia, there are no or only limited data available on the occurring tick species in the endemic areas, on the prevalence of TBEV in ticks, its distribution in Croatia, and its genetic characteristics. The red fox (V. vulpes) has been shown to be a suitable indi- cator for TBE risk assessment analysis in endemic areas in Europe (Leschnik et al., 2002; Süss, 2008a). In this study, we chose the red fox as the sentinel vertebrate species for tick collection, since it shares the same habitat as the main TBEV reservoirs, rodents, and is widely distributed in TBE-endemic areas in Croatia (estimated red fox population: 15,000–20,000 individuals). Two out of 5 tick species removed from red foxes were identified as TBEV carriers, unfed I. ricinus, as the most common TBEV-Eu vector, and I. hexagonus which already had taken some blood on the fox (Table 3). The main host of I. hexagonus is the hedgehog that has been previously recognized as a potential TBEV carrier and host (Nosek and Grulich, 1967; Kŕivanec et al., 1988). Even though no later papers were published on the involvement of the hedgehog and I. hexagonus in TBEV transmission, the fact that I. hexagonus was identified as a potential secondary vector of TBEV (Nosek and Grulich, 1967) does open the question of TBEV transmission routes and reservoir hosts in Croatia. TBEV prevalence found in ticks in our study was similar to or higher than the average prevalence (0.1–5%) in ticks from other TBE-endemic areas in Europe (Leschnik et al., 2002; Carpi et al., 2009; Süss, 2011). According to our results, one would expect a higher case incidence in humans in Croatia than that recorded, since in low-incidence areas infected ticks are often even not detected (Juceviciene et al., 2005; Süss, 2003). This discrepancy in Croatia could be a result of unrecognized TBE human infec- tions, since the clinical features of milder TBE in humans are often non-specific (Gritsun et al., 2003; Miletic-Medved et al., 2011). Another factor causing low TBE incidence in Croatia could be pub- lic awareness and vaccination that is not obligatory, but strongly recommended. Even though nymphs are considered to be the main vectors of TBE virus, all TBEV-positive ticks in our study were adults, probably due to a very low number of collected/tested nymphs during our L.

Jemeršić et al. / Ticks and T nvestigation. The positive ticks were collected in Varazdin County human population size in 2001: 184,769) and Zagreb County human population size in 2001: 1,089,145), both known as TBE igh-incidence districts. Similar results were obtained in northern taly where the majority of TBEV-positive ticks were also adults n areas with an increase of human TBE cases in the preceding 2 ecades (Süss, 2011; Carpi et al., 2009; Rizzoli et al., 2009). Interestingly, on the basis of sequence and amino acid anal- ses, the isolates from Zagreb County differed from those from arazdin County, forming a cluster, genetically closely related o isolates from Germany, Austria, and Finland. Prior to our nvestigation, only one Croatian isolate of TBEV had been genet- cally analyzed and reported (Ecker et al., 1999; Carpi et al., 009). However, its origin, date, and location of isolation are nknown. Taking domestic and wild animals as sentinels to recognize TBE- ndemic areas has shown promising results (Labuda et al., 2002; arpi et al., 2007; Roelandt et al., 2010; Kiffner et al., 2011; Süss, 011; Klaus et al., 2012; Cagnacci et al., 2012; Bolzoni et al., 2012). arge wild ungulates are common hosts of adult ticks of different pecies, and as such they may indirectly support the occurrence f TBEV (Rizzoli et al., 2009). However, assessments and eco- pidemiological models have been developed to define the impact f the density of deer versus tick infestation of rodents in defining BE hazard. According to Cagnacci et al. (2012), and Bolzoni et al. 2012), a low density of deer or their absence, increases tick feeding n rodents, leading to the potential for tick-borne disease hotspots. ur investigation included testing of spleen samples collected from ed deer (C. elaphus) from 2 areas in north-eastern Croatia (esti- ated local population of red deer is 7000) for the presence of BEV. Interestingly, a viral prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3–3.0%) has een found. The positive red deer were hunted in Vukovar-Srijem ounty and Osijek-Baranja County. The latest human TBE cases rom Vukovar-Srijem and Osijek-Baranja County were recorded in 009 (one case) and 2010 (one case), respectively. From each of 2 TBEV-positive red deer, a different viral clus- er has been isolated indicating that both clusters detected in icks as well as in deer may be found in all investigated areas of roatia. The spatial distribution (bordering Hungary, Serbia, and osnia-Herzegovina) and migration of red deer might allow passive ransport of infected ticks to distant locations, therefore a survey ncluding TBEV prevalence in red deer from bordering countries ould contribute to a better eco-epidemiological understanding nd risk assessment. In conclusion, as a result of our study, we identified the most ommon tick species infesting the red fox (V. vulpes) in TBE- ndemic areas in Croatia. TBEV was detected in the proven TBEV ector ticks I. ricinus and I. hexagonus in Croatia. TBEV was isolated rom red deer spleen, indicating viraemia, even though the role of ed deer in the maintenance of TBEV in its natural cycle is still ques- ionable. The red deer may have an important role in the transport nd spread of infected ticks. The TBEV isolates derived from ticks nd red deer in this study were shown to be genetically close to ther TBEV-Eu isolates and also among each other. Nevertheless, or a better understanding and identification of the most common BEV vertebrate reservoir hosts in Croatia, further investigations hould be carried out including also other animal species, espe- ially rodents, and the survey should be expanded to neighbouring ountries with TBE cases in humans. eferences olzoni, L., Rosá, R., Cagnacci, F., Rizzoli, A., 2012.

The 779 wild birds representing 60 species were captured carrying a total of 841 ticks, Ixodes pavlovskyi Pom., 1946 (n = 531), Ixodes persulcatus P. Sch., 1930 (n = 244), and Ixodes plumbeus Leach. 1815 (n = 66). The highest average number of ticks per bird in a particular species was found for the fieldfare (Turdus pilaris Linnaeus, 1758) (5.60 ticks/bird) and the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis Linnaeus, 1758) (13.25 ticks/bird). Samples from wild birds and ticks collected in highly endemic periods from 2006 to 2011 were tested for the TBEV markers using monoclonal modified enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and RT-PCR. TBEV RNA and antigen were found in 9.7% and 22.8% samples collected from wild birds, respectively. TBEV markers were also detected in 14.1% I. persulcatus ticks, 5.2% ild birds ieldfare (Turdus pilaris) omsk I. pavlovskyi, and 4.2% I. plumbeus ticks collected from wild birds. Two TBEV strains were also isolated on PKE (pig kidney embryo) cells from fieldfare and Blyth’s reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum Blyth, 1849). Sequencing of 5′-NCR of TBEV revealed that all TBEV isolates belong to Far Eastern (dominate) and Siberian genotypes. Several phylogenetic subgroups included TBEV sequences novel for the Tomsk region. Our data suggest that wild birds are potential disseminators of TBEV, TBEV-infected ixodid ticks, and possibly other tick-borne infections. ntroduction Tick-borne encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is a ausative infectious agent of tick-borne encephalitis, one of the ost dangerous viral infectious diseases in the Russian Federation Korenberg and Kovalevskii, 1999). A TBEV infection in humans s characterized by high fever and various lesions in the central ervous system. Mortality of TBEV infection is highly dependent n the involved genotype of the virus. Three genotypes, Euro- ean, Siberian, and Far Eastern, have been described and named ∗ Corresponding author at: State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology Vector”, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region 630559, Russia.

Mortality is relatively low for European and Siberian genotypes (1–2%), but goes up to 30% for Far Eastern genotype (Gritsun et al., 2003a). The geographical distribution of different genotypes of TBEV is more complex than their names suggest and can be described as mixed and/or mosaic (Zlobin et al., 2007). For example, the Far Eastern TBEV genotype was detected in the Crimea, in the Baltic States, in the Ural Mountains, Western and Eastern Siberia (Kovalev et al., 2010; Iurchenko et al., 2012). The European genotype was recently found as far east as in the Republic of Korea (Yun et al., 2009). The average incidence of TBE in Russia varied from 1.9 to 4.4 cases per 100,000 per year from 2001 to 2011 (State report Russian Federation, 2011c). Significant geographical variation in the inci- dence of TBE has been consistently observed across Russia. Higher than the national average incidence of TBE cases in humans has been reported in some regions in Siberia in the past years.

Mikryukova et al. / Ticks and n Tomsk region, the officially reported incidence of the disease as from 15.5 to 72.5 per 100,000 in the past decade (State report omsk, 2011b). The majority of these cases (74%) were within omsk City, the largest city in the region. Interestingly, the annual BE incidence in the Novosibirsk region located only 200 km to he south of Tomsk has been much lower with 4.80–6.48 cases in he past 3 years (State report Novosibirsk, 2010). An even lower nnual incidence (0.36–1.0 cases per 100,000) has been reported or the Far Eastern region, where TBEV was originally discovered in 937 (State report Khabarovsk, 2011a). These data suggest unique co-epidemiological features of the TBEV foci in Tomsk region. Previously, we isolated viruses of both Siberian and Far East- rn genotypes from ticks in Tomsk and its suburbs. Far Eastern BEV genotype was more prevalent in the urban foci, whereas the iberian genotype was dominant in suburban foci (Chausov et al., 009, 2010). The principal vectors and hosts for TBEV in Tomsk and ther regions in Siberia are I. persulcatus ticks and small rodents, espectively. However, in the urban landscapes, it has recently been hown that I. pavlovskyi ticks are predominant and may support BEV circulation in the city (Romanenko, 2011; Romanenko and ondrat’eva, 2011). Interestingly, I. pavlovskyi ticks feed mainly on ild birds at all stages of their life cycle suggesting that birds may e involved in the eco-epidemiology of TBEV (Bolotin et al., 1977). To determine the role of wild birds in the circulation and spread f TBEV in urban and suburban foci in Tomsk, we studied samples rom wild birds and individual ticks collected from 2006 to 2011 or the presence of TBEV markers (viral RNA and antigen). aterials and methods ild bird and tick sampling In May to August in 2006–2011, wild birds were captured in 3 ypes of locations: urban landscapes (Stadium, University Grove, outhern graveyard); suburban settings (TNHZ, Kolarovo); rural nd forest areas (Haldeevo, Maloyksinskyi), as previously described Moskvitina et al., 2008). The capture of and experiments with wild irds were done in accordance with the permits 70 no. 024401 and 0 no. 024399 from the local government and regulations for work- ng with wild animals. The ticks (adults, nymphs, and larvae) were ollected from captured wild birds. The identification of tick and ird species was carried out as recommended by zoological taxo- omic guides (Ryabitsev, 2001; Filippova, 1997). Ticks were stored t −70 ◦C until nucleic acid extraction and virus isolation. RT-PCR ith primers specific to tick mitochondrial DNA was also used to dentify tick species. etection of TBEV markers TBEV antigens were detected by means of the immune-enzyme nalysis as previously described (Ternovoi et al., 2007). Briefly, viral ntigen was captured on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plates rom 10% homogenates of ticks and internal organs of birds with onoclonal antibodies 10H10 against protein E of TBEV. Immune omplexes were detected by EB1 monoclonal antibody against rotein E of TBEV labeled with biotin, which was revealed by avidin- eroxidase. RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and detection of BEV cDNA by RT-PCR was done as described previously (Chausov t al., 2009, 2010). irus isolation Tick homogenates diluted 1:10 were used to infect PKE (pig kid- ey embryo) cells. The infected cells were incubated at 37 ◦C for days in Eagle MEM medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine orne Diseases 5 (2014) 145– 151 serum. The cell culture supernatant was used to infect the next pas- sage of PKE cells. The viral RNA for sequencing was purified from infected PKE cells after the 5th passage. Sequencing of PCR products, structural and phylogenetic analysis RT-PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gel and gel-purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed using CEQ DTCS Kit (Beckman-Coulter, Cat# 608000, USA) on Beckman Coulter CEQ2000 XL genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All sam- ples were analyzed twice in independent experiments. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies were performed using Vector NTI Suite 10.0 (www.invitrogen.com) and MEGA 5 (Tamura et al., 2011). Results Ticks collected from wild birds In the course of the study, we captured 779 wild birds and col- lected 841 larval, nymphal, and adult ixodid ticks from these birds, 244 I. persulcatus, 531 I. pavlovskyi, and 66 I. plumbeus. The max- imum number of collected ticks from one fieldfare (Turdus pilaris Linnaeus, 1758) was 70 ticks including 19 larvae, 33 nymphs, and 18 adults. The list of captured bird species with all stages of ixodid ticks is presented in Table 1. In summary, we collected 3 species of ticks from captured wild birds: I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi, and I. plumbeus. The birds we captured in suburban locations were pre- dominantly carrying I. persulcatus, whereas the urban birds mostly carried I. pavlovskyi. Ixodes plumbeus were found only on the sand martins. Ticks (all stages) were found from early May until mid August on birds with maximum numbers in June and July. Most frequently, we found larvae and nymphs – 47.9% and 37.7%, respec- tively. Adults constituted only 14.4%. Different stages of ticks (in various combinations) on a single bird were found in 46.2% of birds. Detection of TBEV markers To determine the prevalence of TBEV in wild birds, we analyzed 489 wild-bird samples, collected from May until mid August, for TBEV infection, for viral antigen and RNA. We found TBEV markers in 40 bird species out of 60 species tested. The prevalence of TBEV markers (RNA and antigen) in TBEV-positive bird species ranged from 14% to 63% with a very significant month-to-month and year- to-year fluctuation. On average, among TBEV-positive bird species, 9.7% of the individuals were found to be positive for viral RNA and 22.8% for viral antigen. The highest prevalences (>50%) of TBEV markers were found in fieldfares, common redstarts, and brambling birds, which could be explained by their relatively frequent contact with infected ticks and a more or less high individual susceptibility of these birds to TBEV. To determinate the prevalence of TBEV markers in ixodid ticks collected from wild birds in TBEV foci, we studied 466 individual ticks (larvae, nymphs, adults). Specifically, we analyzed 71 I. persul- catus, 324 I. рavlovskyi, and 71 I. plumbeus ticks. Both TBEV RNA and antigen were found in 14.1% of I. persulcatus, 5.2% of I. рavlovskyi, and 4.2% of I. plumbeus ticks. We found TBEV-positive I. persulcatus larvae on the common redstart and the tree pipit and I. pavlovskyi larvae only on the fieldfare. TBEV-positive I. persulcatus nymphs were found on the fieldfare, the redwing, the Eurasian tree spar- row, and the tree pipit, and I. pavlovskyi nymphs on the fieldfare, the redwing, the Eurasian tree sparrow, and the tree pipit. Most of TBEV-positive ticks (larvae and nymphs) were collected from field- fares and redwings (11 from 17). However, no infected I. plumbeus http://www.invitrogen.com/ T.P.

Generally, the prevalence of TBEV arkers in I. plumbeus ticks was lower than in other ixodid ticks. haracterization of the TBEV isolated from wild birds and ixodid icks We isolated 2 strains of TBEV designated as Tms B08-12 and ms B08-14 (GenBank KC602117 and KC602118) on PKE cells from eldfare and Blyth’s reed warbler. All other attempts to isolate ny viral strains from TBEV-positive samples on PKE cells failed. e used total viral RNA from Tms B08-12 and Tms B08-14 virus s well as viral cDNA fragments from 20 RT-PCR-positive individ- al ticks and 10 birds to determine viral sequences of the 5′-NCR f the viral genome for phylogenetic analysis as described previ- usly (Chausov et al., 2009, 2010). Eleven TBEV sequences were btained from I. рavlovskyi ticks and 9 sequences from I. persulcatus icks. The phylogenetic analysis of 5′-NCR sequences is presented in ig. 1. We found 23 isolates of the Far Eastern genotype and 9 of the iberian genotype. Both isolated TBEV strains Tms B08-12 and Tms 08-14 from birds belonged to the Far Eastern genotype. The Far astern sequences from birds and ticks segregate into several puta- ive subclusters. Two subclusters grouped with the well-known rototype strains Glubinnoe/2004 and 205. We found Glubinnoe- ike isolates in samples from ticks and wild birds. The sequences of he Siberian genotype isolates segregated into 3 putative subclus- ers: Zausaev-like, Kolarovo-like, and a third unique subcluster. The ausaev-like sequences isolated from ticks and wild birds were very imilar to the human isolate Zausaev (1983) from a patient with ethal chronic TBEV infection (Gritsun et al., 2003b). The Kolarovo- ike sequences in this study were isolated from wild birds, and the BEV strain Kolarovo-2008 was isolated from an I. pavlovskyi tick in he study site Kolarovo (Chausov et al., 2011). The c37-2 and 220308 equences from I. persulcatus ticks were unique and did not clus- er with any other Siberian strains of TBEV. The same is true for he Tms 10–18 isolate (from I. pavlovskyi). This isolate is a possible andidate for a new subcluster within the Siberian genotype. In summary, we discovered a high genetic biodiversity of TBEV nd novel TBEV sequences in wild birds and ixodid ticks in Tomsk egion for 2 main genotypes of TBEV. We propose that circulation f TBEV between wild birds and ixodid ticks is a possible driving actor for the often high TBEV variability in highly endemic TBEV oci. iscussion The role of wild birds in the transmission of flaviviruses is ell documented for several mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as est Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and Usutu viruses (Hubálek, 2004; siodras et al., 2008; Lelli et al., 2008). TBEV as a tick-borne fla- ivirus is most often transmitted by I. ricinus ticks in Europe and . persulcatus in northern Asia (Gritsun et al., 2003a). Previously, 6 pecies of ixodid ticks such as Dermacentor reticulatus Fabr., 1794 D. pictus); the taiga tick, I. persulcatus P. Sch., 1930; I. pavlovskyi om., 1946; I. trianguliceps Bir., 1901; I. plumbeus Leach. 1815; nd Haemaphysalis concinna Koch 1844 were reported as vectors or TBEV in Tomsk foci (Romanenko, 2004, 2009). Usually, only I. avlovskyi, I. persulcatus, and D. reticulatus ticks attack humans. he other species of ixodid ticks (I. trianguliceps, I. plumbeus, H. oncinna) have not been reported to attack humans probably ecause of their low abundance and close association with their ain hosts. The TBEV usually circulates in natural foci between ticks and mall mammals (Gritsun et al., 2003a). The role of wild birds in he spread and circulation of TBEV is not well defined. It was orne Diseases 5 (2014) 145– 151 suggested that wild birds participate in TBEV circulation in the nat- ural foci of Tomsk region 50–60 years ago (Fedorov, 1958). Since then, dissemination of ticks infected with TBEV and/or other tick- borne pathogens by wild birds has been described in several other regions (Hubálek, 2004; Waldenström et al., 2007; Kempf et al., 2011; Dietrich et al., 2011; Movila et al., 2013). Moreover, TBEV viremia was demonstrated in mallards after experimental infection and thereby also their potential involvement in TBEV circulation in nature (van Tongeren, 1983). TBEV spread by migratory birds was also hypothesized by Suzuki et al. (2007) based on the phyloge- netic analysis of TBEV sequences. They proposed that Far Eastern TBEV was exported to Japanese islands by migratory birds from continental regions of Far Eastern Russia. The prevalence of TBEV markers in ixodid ticks varied broadly depending on the month of tick collection, the life stage of ticks, and weather conditions. Prevalence was found to range from 5.7% to 7.5% in I. pavlovskyi and I. persulcatus ticks (all stages) randomly collected in Tomsk and its suburbs (Chausov et al., 2010). These figures are generally consistent with our data on the finding of TBEV markers in ticks collected from wild birds. The high inci- dence of tick-borne infections in Tomsk region correlates with the very high frequency of tick attacks on humans. The cardinal fea- ture of the current eco-epidemiological situation in Tomsk is the high abundance of I. pavlovskyi ticks and their apparent spread sup- ported by wild birds living in suburban and urban environments. A similar situation was recently reported for Novosibirsk and its suburbs (Livanova et al., 2012; Malkova et al., 2012). Our study com- plements these reports confirming the importance of wild birds for the spread of I. pavlovskyi ticks in and around large cities in Siberia. We used RT-PCR for the detection of TBEV RNA and EIA for the detection of TBEV antigen in tick and wild-bird samples. Viral antigen was detected more frequently than viral RNA. The high effi- ciency of antigen-capture EIA for detection of flaviviruses in field samples was previously demonstrated for dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in swine, human, and mosquito samples (Duong et al., 2011; Voge et al., 2013; Mei et al., 2012). We, too, found that antigen-capture EIA is suitable for analysing tick homogenates (Chausov et al., 2009, 2010). The genetic markers of several infections such as West Nile virus, Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp. were also previ- ously detected in ixodid ticks collected in Tomsk foci (Chausov et al., 2009). Other studies suggested that migratory birds are involved in the spreading of tick-borne infections such as Rickettsia spp., Bor- relia spp., Babesia spp., and possibly also the European genotype of TBEV (Hamer et al., 2012a,b; Dietrich et al., 2011; Marsot et al., 2012; Movila et al., 2011, 2013). Together with our data, these stud- ies suggest a possible role of wild birds in the dissemination of TBEV and other tick-borne infections that warrant further investigation. We surveyed 779 captured wild birds and found ixodid ticks on 19 species of birds. Multiple contacts of fieldfares with I. persulcatus and/or I. pavlovskyi ticks were found with captured birds bearing 6 ixodid ticks on average. Taking into account the period of activity of ixodid ticks in this region and their feeding time on birds, we can estimate that one fieldfare may be in contact with approximately 60–120 ticks within one endemic season. Thus, the probability of multiple contacts between fieldfares and TBEV-infected I. persul- catus and/or I. pavlovskyi ticks within one endemic season appears very high. The relatively long lifespan of these birds (approximately 18 years) together with the high population size both in urban and suburban environments makes the contact of the birds with the virus virtually inevitable (Ravkin and Ravkin, 2005). The find- ing of TBEV markers in other species of birds suggests that several species of birds are involved in the circulation of TBEV during the high tick activity season. The high density of fieldfares in suburban areas and large cities supports the hypothesis that this bird species T.P. Mikryukova et al. / Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 5 (2014) 145– 151 149 Fig. 1.

The finding of the Far Eastern genotype of TBEV in Crimea (Iurchenko et al., 2012) could be linked to the migration of infected wild birds (fieldfares) from Western Siberia to the basin of the Black Sea. The sand martin and the garden warbler are other species of migratory wild birds found 1 Tick-b w w R o s i b s b b s i w c d 2 o 1 w g h i m ( o t s l s n W E P e E d T U m F ( h b s T o d b i i c t w N i w T l m t f T i 50 T.P. Mikryukova et al. / Ticks and ith TBEV-infected ixodid ticks. The sand martin winters in Africa, hereas the garden warbler migrates to India (Moskvitin, 1992; avkin and Ravkin, 2005). The nomadic and migratory activities f the birds throughout Europe and Asia, their high densities in uburban areas and large cities suggests that wild birds may be mplicated in (i) spreading of TBEV and other tick-borne infections y carrying infected ticks; (ii) transportation of ixodid ticks (over hort and long distances) to new biotopes; (iii) establishing tick- orne infection foci in and around large cities; (iv) supporting TBEV iodiversity in highly endemic TBEV foci. Sequencing of 5′-NCR of TBEV and phylogenetic analyses howed also that the Far Eastern genotype was dominant in stud- ed birds and tick samples. Similar results were obtained previously hen the Far Eastern genotype was predominantly found in ticks ollected in Tomsk city, whereas the Siberian genotype was pre- ominantly found in ticks in suburban foci (Chausov et al., 2009, 010). We were able to isolate and sequence genomic fragments f the 2 newly isolated TBEV strains Tms B08-12 and Tms B08- 4 from wild birds. Notably, viral isolates and RNA isolates from ild birds clustered with TBEV strain Glubinnoe/2004 in phylo- enetic analyses. This strain was isolated from fulminant lethal uman cases in the Far Eastern region of Russia. Rapid replication n PKE cells and a high level of infectious virion production are the ajor differences between Glubinnoe/2004 and other TBEV strains Ternovoi et al., 2007). The high level of homology between 5′-NCR f the TBEV variants from wild birds and Glubinnoe/2004 suggests hat the highly effective replication is typical for the isolated TBEV trains. Importantly, this is the first isolation of Glubinnoe/2004- ike TBEV strains outside the Far Eastern region of Russia. TBEV trains isolated in China Senzhang and MDJ01 as well as other Chi- ese strains belong to the Far-Eastern subtype (Zhang et al., 2012; u et al., 2013). These strains cluster with common Russian Far astern strains such as Glubinnoe/2004, Kavalerovo, Svetlogorie, rimorye-52 in cluster III, Senzhang-like TBEV strains (Leonova t al., 2013). These molecular epidemiological data suggest that Far astern, Chinese, and Siberian TBEV have a similar coevolution and issemination in these geographic regions. The role of wild birds in BEV dissemination, even though appealing, remains hypothetical. nfortunately, we could find only fragmentary reports (bird ring essages) of possible seasonal migration of birds in the triangle ar East–China–Siberia. The fast dissemination of avian influenza H5N1) from China to Siberia by wild birds (Shestopalov et al., 2006) as shown that transmission of TBEV (Far Eastern genotype) by wild ird is possible. The isolation of TBEV strains from fieldfares indicates that a per- istent presence of the virus is possible in this species of birds. his is also indirectly supported by the following: (a) detection f TBEV antigen and RNA as well as live virus in these birds; (b) etection of TBEV markers and virus in ixodid ticks collected from irds; (c) the large size of populations of wild birds and ixodid ticks n Western Siberia. Additionally, TBEV persistence in wild birds s indirectly supported by proliferation of TBEV in different cell ultures and its potential to cause chronic forms of TBEV infec- ion (Gritsun et al., 2003b). The duration of TBEV persistence in ild birds remains unknown. However, the closely related West ile virus (WNV) is capable of persisting for more than 12 weeks n birds (Wheeler et al., 2012). If the time of TBEV persistence in ild birds is similar to that of WNV, the distance of spreading BEV and possibly also other tick-borne infections by birds could be ong. In this study, we confirm the involvement of wild birds in the for- ation of natural foci of TBEV in Tomsk in 2006–2011. We propose hat wild birds, particularly fieldfares, are potential disseminators or quick dissemination of Far Eastern and Siberian genotypes of BEV, for TBEV-infected ixodid ticks, and possibly other tick-borne nfections over short and perhaps also long distances. orne Diseases 5 (2014) 145– 151 Disclosure statement The authors have no commercial associations that might create a conflict of interest in connection with the manuscript enti- tled “Surveillance of tick-borne encephalitis virus in wild birds and ticks in Tomsk City and its suburbs (Western Siberia)”.

The principal vector is the freshwater mosquito Culex annuliros- tris.16 The virus is considered to be endemic in northern Australia and is periodically reactivated or reintroduced into southern and eastern Australia, but the epidemiology is complex, involving the interplay of vertebrate host, vector, and environmental factors. Although infections occur in a variety of vertebrate hosts, amplification is thought to occur principally in wild birds (waders), especially the Nankeen night heron (Nycticorax caledonicus).16 Horses are known to be susceptible to a number of mosquito-borne flaviviral encephalitides, including infec- tions by West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus.17 Kunjin virus, a subtype of WNV,9 has been implicated as the cause of a single case of naturally occurring encephalo- myelitis in a horse from the state of Victoria in Australia.1 MVEV is known to infect horses, based on serological evi- dence,7 and there is considerable anecdotal evidence to suggest the virus can cause neurological disease.22 Experimental infections of horses with MVEV have had varied outcomes, depending on the dosage and route of inoculation. Intracerebral challenge with high doses of virus has produced encephalitis in horses.7,18 Small doses of peripherally inoculated MVEV have either failed to pro- duce infections7 or have resulted in short-lived viremia and mild, transient clinical signs.13 The current report describes a case of severe, naturally occurring encephalomyelitis in a horse, attributed to MVEV. During April 2008, a 5-year-old Australian stock horse mare from Monto, Queensland, Australia (24°52′S, 151°07′E) developed neurological signs. When examined by the veteri- narian on day 1, the horse was in a mildly stuporous state but could be roused by stimulation. Mild ataxia and forelimb pro- prioceptive deficits were noted. Appetite was depressed, but vital signs were normal. Treatment with parenterala and oralb nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories was instigated. By day 3, there was a degree of facial paralysis, affecting the upper and lower lips but not the eyelids. By day 6, the horse was later- ally recumbent and unable to lift its head. At this stage, the horse was euthanized with a barbituratec overdose, and a field necropsy was conducted. The only abnormality noted at nec- ropsy was brain swelling, which decreased after the dura mater was opened. 433325 XXXXXX10.1177/1040638711433325Gord on et al.Encephalitis caused by Murray Valley encephalitis virus From the Biosecurity Sciences Laboratory, Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Coopers Plains, Queensland, Australia (Gordon, Oakey); All Creatures Vet Services, Monto, Queensland, Australia (Marbach); Tropical and Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory, Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Townsville, Queensland, Australia (Edmunds, Condon); School of Biomedical Sciences, Curtin University, Bentley, Western Australia, Australia (Diviney, Williams); and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia (Bingham). 1Corresponding Author: Anita N.

A 5-year-old Australian stock horse in Monto, Queensland, Australia, developed neurological signs and was euthanized after a 6-day course of illness. Histological examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed moderate to severe subacute, nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. Sections of spinal cord stained positively in immunohistochemistry with a flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibody. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the envelope gene of flavivirus yielded positive results from brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, and facial nerve. A flavivirus was isolated from the cerebrum and spinal cord. Nucleotide sequences obtained from amplicons from both tissues and virus isolated in cell culture were compared with those in GenBank and had 96–98% identity with Murray Valley encephalitis virus. The partial envelope gene sequence of the viral isolate clustered into genotype 1 and was most closely related to a previous Queensland isolate.

Tissues, including brain and cervical spinal cord, were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and then paraffin embedded, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, using standard techniques. Histology revealed moderate to severe subacute, nonsuppurative encephalomy- elitis. Changes were more severe in the hippocampus, mid- brain, medulla, and cervical spinal cord than in the cerebrum. The minimum change at all levels of the brain was perivas- cular cuffs in both gray and white matter. Cuffs were of vari- able thickness and consisted of a mixture of lymphocytes and histiocytes (Fig. 1). In the spinal cord, severe inflamma- tion was largely restricted to the gray matter (Fig. 2). Diffuse and focal gliosis were present throughout the brain and spinal cord. In the more severely affected areas of midbrain and medulla, swollen, chromatolytic, and necrotic neurons were present, with glial satellitosis (Fig. 3). There were occa- sional small foci of hemorrhage and malacia in the cerebral white matter, medulla, and spinal cord (Fig. 2). There was also mild nonsuppurative meningitis. No abnormalities were detected in other tissues. Sections of cerebrum, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibodyd directed against a conserved epitope of the nonstructural (NS) 1 protein of MVEV, using methods described elsewhere.2 Granular and diffuse antigen staining was detected in a small number of degenerate neurons, neuronal processes, and the neuropil of spinal cord (Fig. 4). No antigen was detected in cerebrum, cerebellum, or brain stem. Most lesions did not contain anti- gen staining. Samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, brain, spinal cord, and facial nerve were tested by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction assays (RT-nPCRs) for a range of arboviruses, including alphaviruses,21 flavi- viruses,14 and orbiviruses. The latter used an in-house, developmental method still undergoing validation in equids. For flaviviruses, primers FU1PM, cFD3PM, FU2, and cFD4PM of a published method14 were used. Primers FU2 and cFD4PM were modified to include redundancies and to enable reaction with a wider range of flaviviruses than the primers described in the original method. The primer sequences used were as follows: FU1PM (TACAACATGATGGGVAARAGWGARAA), cFD3PM (ARCATGTCTTCYGTBGTCATCCA), FU2 (modified) (GCTGATGACACMGCYGGMTGG GAYAC), and cFD4PM (modified) (AYNACRCARTCRTCYCCRCT).

Encephalitis caused by Murray Valley encephalitis virus 433 All samples were negative for alphaviruses and orbivi- ruses. Positive results for flavivirus were obtained from all samples. Brain and spinal cord samples yielded much brighter amplicon bands than samples of cerebrospinal fluid or nerve, and the reaction from the blood sample was very weak. The flavivirus-positive samples were further tested with an in-house, developmental RT-nPCR specific for Kunjin virus; all samples tested negative. Three samples of cerebrum, 1 sample of cervical spinal cord, and 1 sample of facial nerve were inoculated into yel- low fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (AA) C6/36 cells incu- bated at 28°C for 2 weeks. This was followed by subculture into BSR cells, a clone of baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells, for 1 week at 34°C with supplementation of 5% CO 2 . The AA and BSR cell lines were maintained in a minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serume and the following antimicrobials: penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and amphotericin B (2 ng/ml). Virus was isolated from all samples except facial nerve. Cells showed cytopathic effect characterized by severe cytoplas- mic vacuolation, stringing, rounding-up, and detachment. Supernatants from positive cell culture samples tested PCR- positive for flavivirus. The RT-PCR amplicons (415 bp) were purifiedf and used to template dye termination DNA sequencing reactions using a dideoxynucleotide sequencing kitg and the nested flavivi- rus PCR primers (FU2 [modified] and cFD4PM [modified]). Amplicons were sequenced in both the sense and antisense directions. The reactions were resolved by the Griffith University DNA Sequencing Facility (Nathan, Queensland, Australia), and the resulting chromatograms were proofread and aligned using sequencing software.h The flavivirus group amplicon from virus isolated in cell culture was deter- mined to have an identical nucleotide sequence to those obtained directly from tissue specimens. The consensus nucleotide sequence has been recorded as GenBank acces- sion no. JN206679. This sequence was compared to those in GenBank using the search engine BLAST (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). The highest identity (96%) was with the NS5 gene of MVEV AF161266. BLAST in GenBank of the translated sequence resulted in a 98% similarity with the NS5 protein of MVEV AAC58777 and AAF05296. No other matches were indicated with the nucleotide search. Matches with lower identities (<90%) were noted with other flaviviruses such as Alfuy virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Usuto virus, WNV, and Kunjin virus. Further RT-PCR testing of virus culture extract was per- formed as previously described11 to produce a 462-bp ampli- con of the envelope gene. The amplicon was sequenced (GenBank accession no. JN119766) and aligned with analo- gous gene regions of reference sequences using ClustalW, as implemented in MEGA 4.24 Subsequent phylogenetic analy- sis indicated that the equine MVEV isolate belongs to geno- type 1 (Fig. 5), with highest levels of nucleotide sequence identity to the Queensland strain 857-2002, isolated from Burketown in 2002.12 Close genetic relationships also were inferred with other Queensland and Western Australian strains isolated between 1989 and 2002 (98.3–99.6% nucleo- tide sequence identity). The results suggest that this strain might have been introduced into southeast Queensland from an endemic focus in either northern Queensland or north- western Australia. Outside of the endemic area, there is a strong association between outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and certain weather patterns, including excessive rainfall in east- ern watersheds.20 Monto, in the north Burnett region of south- east Queensland, is not within the endemic area. Although higher-than-average rainfall was recorded in Monto during the summer months (January and February 2008) preced- ing this event, the factors responsible for the current equine case remain unknown. No human cases of MVE, and a single human case of Kunjin virus infection, were recorded from Queensland during 2008 (Australian Government, Department of Health and Ageing: 2005, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Available at: http://www .health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/ cda-surveil-nndss-nndssintro.htm. Accessed May, 25, 2011). The diagnosis of encephalomyelitis due to MVEV in the current case was based on a combination of consistent histo- pathology, demonstration of flavivirus antigen within neurons and neuropil, virus isolation, positive RT-PCR, and nucleotide sequencing. The nonsuppurative encephalomyeli- tis in the horse in the present study has the histological hall- marks of a viral infection of the central nervous system: neuronal degeneration, reactivity of the glia, and perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and histiocytes.17 Although there Figure 4.

Moderate to severe nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis and meningoencephalitis were reported in 2 horses that died in southern Australia in 1974 during an epidemic of human MVE,7 but infection with MVEV could not be confirmed in either horse. Horses with naturally occurring WNV infection have nonsuppurative polioenceph- alomyelitis, with the most severe lesions located in the Figure 5.

Other features common to the 2 infections include petechial and ring haemorrhages4 and a relative scarcity of flavivirus antigen detectable by immuno- histochemistry.3 In the current case, despite widespread dis- tribution of severe lesions, antigen was confined to 1 section of the spinal cord, and it was sparse within this location. This would indicate that the viral antigen was probably largely cleared or blocked by local central nervous system antibody at the time of death. The differential diagnosis of viral encephalitides in Australian horses has, until recently, been a short list. Many of the recognized viral equine encephalitides are exotic to Australia; such encephalitides include the alphaviruses Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encepha- litis virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; Rabies virus; Equine encephalosis virus; Borna disease virus; and other tick-borne encephalitides such as Louping ill virus.8 For Australian horses, there are infrequent records of enceph- alomyelitis attributable to Equid herpesvirus 1,23 Hendra virus,6 and Kunjin virus.1 Japanese encephalitis virus has caused subclinical infections in horses in Torres Strait (north of the Australian mainland),10 is spreading into previously nonendemic areas,5 and should be considered in future out- breaks of equine neurological disease. At the time the horse in the current case was diagnosed with encephalitis, Hendra virus infection was considered to be a cause of predominantly fulminating respiratory disease in horses.19 In June 2008, the 10th recognized outbreak of Hendra virus infection manifested primarily as neurological disease.6 The serious zoonotic risk of Hendra virus infection now dictates a much more cautious approach to postmortem sampling in horses with neurological disease (Queensland Government: 2011, Guidelines for veterinarians handling potential Hendra virus infection in horses, version 4.1. Available at: http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/4790_13371.htm. Accessed May 26, 2011). This zoonotic risk complicates the future diagnosis of flaviviral, and indeed any infectious encephalomyelitis, in Queensland horses. There is height- ened awareness of the potential for flaviviruses to spread, emerge, and appear in new geographic locations,15 and the current confirmed equine case of MVE could likely be the forerunner of further such cases.

Before 2010, BAGV had only been identified in mosquitoes in Central and Western Africa6,7,16 and in India.3 In all cases, it was found in mosqui- toes in the context of surveillance activities addressed to other viruses causing diseases of relevance, both for animals and human beings. In India, serological studies suggested that it might be able to infect human beings,3 although such patho- genicity of the virus is currently unknown. Sequence homol- ogy suggested that BAGV is synonymous to Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus (TMEV),12 a pathogen affecting turkeys that was first described in Israel in 195810 and which has been repeatedly isolated in that country.4 Out- side Israel, TMEV has only been reported in South Africa.2 In September 2010, BAGV was detected and identified in the southernmost province of Spain (Cádiz), as the etiologi- cal agent of an outbreak in wild birds.1 The outbreak caused mortality in 2 bird species (red-legged partridges, Alectoris rufa; ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus), which were found dead in different hunting properties. As valued wild game birds, both species are often reared in captivity and released for hunting purposes. The red-legged partridge is native to Spain, where wild populations are still abundant,15 whereas the ring-necked pheasant (or, common pheasant) is an exotic, introduced game species.5 BAGV was identified as the causative agent of the out- break during laboratory investigations using a pan-flaviviral hemi-nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, amplifying a fragment of the nonstructural NS5 protein coding region of the viral RNA,14 which was subsequently sequenced to confirm the identity of the viral genome detected.1 However, this method is cumbersome, time consuming, and, as often happens with nested PCR methods,9 prone to cross-contamination, and therefore is not suitable for efficient diagnosis and disease surveillance.

In September 2010, an outbreak of disease in 2 wild bird species (red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa; ring- necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus) occurred in southern Spain. Bagaza virus (BAGV) was identified as the etiological agent of the outbreak. BAGV had only been reported before in Western Africa (Central African Republic, Senegal) and in India. The first occurrence of BAGV in Spain stimulated a demand for rapid, reliable, and efficacious diagnostic methods to facilitate the surveillance of this disease in the field. This report describes a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method based on a commercial 5’-Taq nuclease-3’ minor groove binder DNA probe and primers targeting the Bagaza NS5 gene. The method allowed the detection of BAGV with a high sensitivity, whereas other closely related flaviviruses (Usutu virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus) were not detected. The assay was evaluated using field samples of red-legged partridges dead during the outbreak (n = 11), as well as samples collected from partridges during surveillance programs (n = 81). The results were compared to those obtained with a pan-flaviviral hemi-nested RT- PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing, which was employed originally to identify the virus involved in the outbreak. The results obtained with both techniques were 100% matching, indicating that the newly developed real-time RT-PCR is a valid technique for BAGV genome detection, useful in both diagnosis and surveillance studies. Key words: Bagaza virus; diagnostics; Flavivirus; real time; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1177%2F1040638712452723&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2012-07-17 960 Buitrago et al. this disease, and to enable surveillance based on the detec- tion of the BAGV genome, a real-time RT-PCR method spe- cific for this virus was developed, and its diagnostic performance was evaluated using field samples and virus isolates from the first outbreak of this disease in Spain. The present article describes the development and evaluation of this new technique. As a first step, nucleotide primers and a commercial probe aimed at the specific detection of BAGV were designed based on multiple alignments comprising a highly conserved sequence within the NS5 region of different flaviviruses. The alignment included sequences from 3 different BAGV strains (African strain Dak Ar B209, Indian strain 96363, and Spanish strain H/2010), 4 different WNV strains (Kunjin strain MRM61C, NY99, PT6.39, and Eg101), 1 Usutu virus strain (SAAR-1776), and 1 Zika virus strain (MR 766; GenBank accession nos. AY632545, EU684972, HQ644144, D00246, DQ211652, AJ965630, EU081844, AY453412, and AY632535, respectively). Sequences were aligned using commercial software.a Based on this alignment (Fig. 1), a primer pair and a probe specific for BAGV were designed using commercial software.b The forward primer (nucleotide positions 8980– 8999, numbered according to GenBank EU684972) was 5’-GGAAGCAGGGCCATATGGTA-3’, the reverse primer (nucleotide positions 9041–9020, numbered as above) was 5’-CGAGGGCCTCAAAYTCTARRAA-3’, and the probe (nucleotide positions 9005–9017, numbered as above) con- sisted of 5’-FAM-TGGCTYGGATCCC-MGB-3’. The probe was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and at the 3’-end with a nonfluorescent quencher bound to an minor groove binder (MGB) group.c The probe and 1 of the selected primers contained, respec- tively, 1 and 3 degenerate positions to improve the specific- ity of the real-time RT-PCR for BAGV (Fig. 1). To achieve the best conditions for RT-PCR amplification, the protocol was optimized by testing different concentrations of primers and probe. The final protocol consisted of a 1-step RT-PCR with the following mixture: RT-PCR buffer,d RT-PCR enzyme mix,d forward primer (0.7 µM final concentration), reverse primer (0.7 µM final concentration), probe (0.15 µM final concentration), and 3 µl of template in a total of 20 µl of reaction volume. Amplification and fluorescence detection were conducted in real-time PCR equipmente using a pro- gram consisting of a reverse transcription step at 48ºC for 25 min followed by inactivation and denaturation at 95ºC for 10 min, and a PCR amplification cycle of 40 cycles of 95ºC for 15 sec, 52ºC for 30 sec, and 60ºC for 30 sec. Fluorescence data were acquired at the end of the 60ºC step. A hemi-nested RT-PCR specific for a broad range of flavivi- ruses14 (the same used in the diagnosis of the outbreak) was performed in parallel in all the samples analyzed in this work, to allow a comparison. The sensitivity of the new method was analyzed by test- ing either serial dilutions of viral RNA or viral suspensions (extracted using an automated procedure,f according to the manufacturer’s protocol) from 200-µl aliquots of cell-culture propagated virus seeds (titrated in median tissue culture infectious doses [TCID 50 ]/ml by a standard limiting dilution titration assay13 using BSR cells, virus titer: 104 TCID 50 /ml) of a cell culture-grown BAGV isolate Spain H/2010 from the heart of an affected partridge in the 2010 outbreak in Spain.1 As a result, the real-time RT-PCR method for BAGV genome detection showed a detection limit of 10-1 TCID 50 /ml, which was comparable to the sensitivity achieved by the pan-flaviviral hemi-nested RT-PCR method performed in parallel (Fig. 2). To study the specificity of the BAGV real-time RT-PCR, purified RNA samples from different flaviviruses, including BAGV isolate Spain H/2010, as well as non-BAGV flavivi- ruses (Usutu virus strain SAAR-1776; Japanese encephalitis virus strain Nakayama; West Nile virus strains NY99, PT6.39, Eg101, and Kunjin MRM 16), and other nonflavivi- ral avian viruses, including avian Influenza A virus (H 5 N 2 , H 5 N 3 , H 7 N 2 , H 7 N 9 ), Newcastle disease virus (mesogenic and lentogenic strains), Beak and feather disease virus, and Gallid herpesvirus 2, were analyzed. The new real-time RT-PCR gave positive results only with BAGV-derived RNA, but not with RNA from other flaviviruses (whose integrity was con- firmed using the broad range of pan-flaviviral hemi-nested RT-PCR; data not shown) or from other avian viruses (whose Figure 1. Sequence alignment showing the position of the primers and probe designed in the current study with regard to the nucleotide sequence of Bagaza virus (BAGV) and of other related flaviviruses (names of strains on the left: see text for more details). The genome stretch represented in the figure corresponds to a part of the NS5 gene of the related flaviviruses (nucleotide positions 8977–9048 according to GenBank accession no. EU684972). Real-time RT-PCR for Bagaza virus 961 integrity was confirmed with PCR or RT-PCR methods spe- cific for each virus; data not shown). This result confirms the specificity of the real-time RT-PCR method for BAGV. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed real- time RT-PCR method in clinical samples, specimens were obtained from red-legged partridges (n = 11) from the dis- ease outbreak that occurred in Cádiz in 2010. The samples were originally submitted for diagnosis to the authors’ labo- ratory at the National Reference Laboratory for Arboviral Diseases of Animals (Spain). Samples consisted of different tissues and/or organs, including heart, intestine, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and feathers from affected as well as non- affected partridges, which were conserved frozen at –70ºC until used in this work. The samples were previously ana- lyzed by real-time RT-PCR specific for lineage 1 and lineage 2 WNV,8 all giving negative results in this test, and by the pan-flaviviral hemi-nested RT-PCR. Tissues and/or organs were homogenized in a volume of 200 µl in phosphate buff- ered saline using commercial equipment,g following the manufacturer’s instructions, and the homogenates obtained were subjected to nucleic acid extraction as above. As a result, all samples identified as positive by hemi-nested RT-PCR were also positive with the new real-time RT-PCR developed in the present study, confirming that the diagnostic sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR is equivalent to the hemi- nested RT-PCR (Table 1). Also, samples from partridges col- lected during surveillance studies in 2010 and 2011 (n = 81) that yielded negative results in the pan-flaviviral hemi-nested RT-PCR were also negative in the new real-time RT-PCR for BAGV (data not shown). In summary, a real-time RT-PCR method was developed that was specifically designed to detect the presence of BAGV genome in clinical samples with a high sensitivity. This new method proved to be valid for the detection of BAGV genome either in virus isolates or in clinical samples from affected animals, providing a sensitivity equivalent to the gel-based pan-flaviviral RT-PCR method previously employed. As compared to the gel-based RT-PCR, the new method offers several advantages, besides its specificity to BAGV. The new method reduces the time required for analy- sis (less than 4 hr following receipt of the samples) without any loss of sensitivity or specificity. The assay also signifi- cantly reduces the risk of false-positive results due to cross- contamination, which is a well-known drawback of nested PCR protocols.9 In addition, in combination with an auto- mated extraction system, this new method would enable large-scale analysis of the virus in animal populations poten- tially affected with the disease, a feature that may be useful Figure 2. Comparison of sensitivity for Bagaza virus (BAGV) using 2 methods performed in parallel: A, gel-based pan-flaviviral reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; above) and hemi-nested RT-PCR (below), and B, real-time RT-PCR specific for BAGV. Serial 10-fold dilutions of BAGV cell-culture supernatant (virus titer: 104 TCID 50 /ml) were prepared (≤10-8) and analyzed by the 2 methods in parallel. In panel A, lanes 1–7 correspond to 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 median tissue culture infective doses (TCID)50/ ml, respectively, whereas lane 8 is a control test. In panel B, the results obtained with the same serial virus dilutions as in A, with the exception of the undiluted sample, and expressed as Log TCID 50 /ml, are represented versus threshold cycle (Ct) obtained in each real-time RT-PCR reaction, performed by duplicate. The regression line is represented, and regression equation, square of correlation coefficient, and efficiency obtained are included in the plot. 962 Buitrago et al. in case of recurrence in the area and/or spread to other areas. This method provides the diagnostic laboratory with an effective and rapid analytical tool, useful in differential diag- nosis and surveillance of this flaviviral disease of birds, which could represent an emerging animal health risk in Europe.

Ten per cent suspensions of tissue were made in 0.05M phosphate buffered saline containing 0.75 per cent bovine al- bumin, pH 7.2-7A. Suspensions were clar- ified by centrifugation and inoculated into two litters of two-day-old Swiss mice by the intracranial (ic) route. A portion of each suspension was held at -60 C for reisolation attempts. Brains were har- vested from sick mice and stored at -60 C. For blind passages, brains of two mice were harvested 8 to 10 days after inocula- tion. Blood specimens were obtained from pa- tients with fatal or nonfatal cases. After separation, one aliquot of serum was held in liquid nitrogen for virus isolation at- tempts and the remainder was saved for serologic testing. Virologic, serologic, and field tech- niques. Methods used for preparing viral antigens and hyper-immune ascitic fluids (HLAF) for use in microtiter hemaggluti- nation-inhibition (HI) and complement- fixation (CF) tests have been described previously (1). Neutralization (N) tests were done by a serum-dilution plaque re- duction technique in Vero cells; 90 per cent plaque reduction was considered a positive result (2). Tests for sensitivity to sodium deoxycholate were performed by the method described by Theiler (3). Field techniques for collecting and processing sera from wild birds for virus isolation and serology and for the use of sentinel mice have been described (4). RESULTS Initial recovery of Rocio virus. On De- cember 5, 1975, a 39-year-old male farm- hand from Iguape county (24° 45'S, 47° 35'W) was admitted to Iguape county hos- pital with a two-day history of 39 C tem- perature, severe headache, drowsiness, and lower limb weakness. A few hours after admission he became comatose and was removed to Hospital Emilio Ribas, an infectious disease hospital in Sao Paulo. The patient developed respiratory failure and died on December 8. Postmortem ex- amination was performed about 20 hours after death, and several samples of CNS and visceral tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, bone marrow) were collected. A virus (strain SPH 34675) was isolated from suspensions of both cerebellum and spinal cord. Suckling mice (SM) appeared sick with typical signs of encephalitis on the fifth day after inoculation. Both strains were easily established in SM and were shown to be identical by HI and CF tests; the strain isolated from cerebellum was chosen as the prototype. Virus was not isolated from visceral tissues or from other areas of the CNS. Subsequent isolation from humans and wild vertebrates. During April and May, 1975, five postmortem examinations were performed on patients who died 12 to 63 days after onset of encephalitis. No virus was isolated from them, even though as many as 10 blind passages in SM were performed. In 1976 a routine was established for obtaining CNS tissue samples from pa- tients who died with encephalitis in the epidemic area. As soon as death occurred in a patient with encephalitis symptoms, the county hospital in the epidemic zone called for a technician who arrived within six to eight hours after the patient expired. CNS samples were collected, stored in liquid nitrogen, and brought to the labo- ratory in Sao Paulo. Samples collected in 1976 from 12 of these patients yielded nine virus strains (table 1). All isolations were similar by serologic testing and identical to SPH 34675. Another two strains were isolated from 395 sentinel mice exposed at Cananeia (25°S, 48°W), and a further strain was obtained from blood of a rufous collared sparrow (.Zonotrichia capensis), a perma- nent resident netted on July 17, 1976, at D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /aje/article-abstract/107/5/444/58569 by U niversity O f C alifornia user on 09 April 2019 446 LOPES ET AL.

Sete Ban-as (24°S, 48°W), a county near Iguape; a total of 1077 wild bird sera were inoculated. No virus was recovered from the sera of 420 patients with acute clinical symptoms of encephalitis; 367 of these sera were obtained within five days of clinical onset. Identification of the etiologic agent. Ro- cio virus (SPH 34675) was shown to be sensitive to sodium deoxycholate. The titer of virus in the untreated control was sl0~* LDJO, and after treatment it was ^10~2-5 LDJSO. An antigen prepared by sucrose ace- tone extraction of infected SM brains yielded a hemagglutinin with a high titer (1/64,000) in a pH range from 6.0 to 6.8 (optimum 6.4). By HI and CF tests, this antigen was compared with HIAF pre- pared with a number of arboviruses iso- lated in Sao Paulo as well as several others isolated in the Americas. Cross-reactions were detected only with HLAFs prepared against flaviviruses, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), Ilheus (ILH), Bussuquara (BSQ) and Yellow Fever (YF) viruses; these re- sults indicated that the isolated agent be- longed to the flavivirus taxon. Subsequent HI, CF and N tests showed Rocio virus to be distinct from other members of that group (table 2). The serologic results showed that the strongest cross-reactions occurred with SLE, ELH, Japanese enceph- alitis (JE) and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) viruses, which constitute a distinct serologic sub-group within the flavivi- ruses. Rocio virus was shown to be pathogenic for several laboratory animals and cell cultures (table 3). The virus grew to high titers in SM brain, and it was pathogenic for six-week-old mice infected by the sub- cutaneous route. Suckling hamsters inoc- ulated ic developed fatal encephalitis, but young adult hamsters inoculated ic devel- oped an encephalitic illness from which they were able to recover. Serologic studies of human cases. Com- plete epidemiologic studies in several counties of Sao Paulo State will be re- ported elsewhere (7). Briefly, we obtained paired sera from 230 of the 462 encephalitis patients with an interval of more than 15 days between collection of acute and con- valescent specimens. By HI and CF tests, 195 pairs (85 per cent) showed either a serologic conversion (fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer) or a superinfection pattern characterized by high, stable titers to flavivirus antigens. Of the antigens tested, the Rocio virus antigen was the most reactive with specimens that showed serologic conversions. The remaining 35 pairs (15 per cent) showed no antibodies for flaviviruses and no significant rise in antibody titer.

(table 2) and is a newly-recognized agent of human disease. Although the virus was isolated 10 times from specimens collected during 18 post- mortem examinations, the timing of spec- imen collection was important in deter- mining the success of virus isolation at- tempts (table 1). When only patients with completed and reliable clinical records were considered, it was found that Rocio virus was isolated from eight of 10 patients who died within five days of onset of ill- ness. Virus was not recovered from pa- tients dying more than 12 days after clini- cal onset; all five patients who died from 12 to 63 days after onset had clear serologic evidence of Rocio virus infection. If humans become viremic, viremia probably occurs before the appearance of neurologic symptoms, since there were no virus isolations from 367 acute sera col- lected within five days after clinical onset. These two characteristics, recovery of vi- rus only from CNS of human beings dying early in the course of illness and no isola- tions from blood collected during the acute stage of illness, are similar to those ob- served in SLE, JE or MVE infections (5). Further evidence that Rocio virus is the etiologic agent of epidemic human enceph- alitis was provided by the results of sero- logic testing of paired sera. Nearly 85 per cent of patients with clin- ical symptoms of encephalitis had clear serologic evidence of a recent flavivirus infection. HI and CF tests on paired sera (table 4) showed that Rocio virus antigen was the most reactive antigen tested, and a limited number of N tests (data not shown) confirmed Rocio as the etiologic agent. Ilheus virus, with a wide geographic distribution in tropical America, was not implicated as the agent of any of the severe illnesses we studied (6).

A program of surveillance and serologic surveys in South America will be required in order to detect other foci of Rocio virus activity; whether recently introduced or only recently detected in Brazil, Rocio vi- rus appears to be well-established in the affected areas of Sao Paulo State.

Martı́n-Acebes,2 Sava Lazic,1 Julio Alonso-Padilla,2 Ana-Belén Blázquez,2 Estela Escribano-Romero,2 Tamas Petrovic,1 and Juan-Carlos Saiz2 Abstract West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus worldwide, has lately reemerged in Europe, causing worrisome outbreaks in humans and horses. Serological analysis by enzyme-linked immunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization test showed for the first time in Serbia that 12% of 349 horses presented specific neutralizing WNV antibodies, which in one case also cross-neutralized Usutu virus (USUV). This is the first time that anti-USUV high neutralizing antibody titers are reported in horses. All these data indicate that WNV and USUV are circulating in the region and advise on the convenience of implementing surveillance programs. Key Words: Horses—Serbia—Usutu virus—Vector-borne—West Nile virus. Introduction West Nile virus (WNV) is the most worldwide distrib-uted flavivirus. Its transmission cycle involves mos- quito vectors and birds, but equines and humans are also susceptible to infection (Komar 2000, Kramer et al. 2007, Blitvich 2008). Human WNV infections are usually asymp- tomatic; however, approximately 1 of 150 cases can progress to encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, which can lead to a fatal outcome (Komar 2000, Kramer et al. 2007, Blitvich 2008). In horses, WNV infection is also frequently clinically unap- parent, but around 10% of cases develop neurological disor- ders with up to 50% mortality rates (Blitvich 2008, Calistri et al. 2010). In Europe, until the 1990s, WNV had caused sporadic outbreaks with rare reports of encephalitis, but its epidemi- ological behavior changed when it reemerged with virulence in Romania, Russia, and the Mediterranean basin, causing dozens of humans and horses deaths (Komar 2000, Kramer et al. 2007, Blitvich 2008, Calistri et al. 2010). In North America, since its first detection in 1999, WNV has already caused in humans over 1100 fatalities, over 12,000 cases of meningitis/encephalitis, and more than 30,000 diagnosed infections, and over 25,000 accumulated cases have been re- ported in horses (www.cdc.gov). Lately, human cases of WN disease (WND) have been described in Italy, Hungary, and Romania, and along 2010 new WNV outbreaks have been reported in Greece and neighboring countries, with more than 250 laboratory-confirmed cases and 27 deaths (www.ecdc .europa.eu). Likewise, an increasing number of severe out- breaks in horses have been reported in Europe, including a large one that took place in northeast Italy in 2008 involving 251 stables with 794 cases and 5 deaths (Calistri et al. 2010). During summer 2010, the first outbreaks of severe WND in horses have been reported in southern Spain, with 41 diag- nosed cases and 10 deaths (www.oie.int/wahis/). All these data suggest that new epidemiological scenarios are being developed in Europe and, thus, that assessment of WNV ac- tivity and implementation of surveillance programs are nec- essary across the continent. The objective of the present study was to analyze, for the first time, the presence of specific anti- WNV antibodies in Serbian horses. Materials and Methods Samples Sera from 349 horses were randomly collected during 2009– 2010 (29.5%, 39.2%, 28.4%, and 2.9% during winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively) in stables of the Belgrade district area, of the municipality of Sabac and of 26 munici- palities of the Vojvodina province of northern Serbia, which is bordered to Croatia, Hungary, and Romania (Fig. 1). Vojvo- dina presents more than 50% of Serbian water surfaces and raises more than one-third of the country’s horses (webrzs .stat.gov.rs/axd/en/god.htm). Almost half of the animals (48.4%) analyzed were racing horses, 36% Lipizzaner breed 1Scientific Veterinary Institute ‘‘Novi Sad,’’ Novi Sad, Serbia. 2Departamento de Biotecnologı́a, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agrarias, Madrid, Spain. VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES Volume X, Number XX, 2011 ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/vbz.2010.0249 1 horses, 10.2% ponies, 1.7% Arabian horses, and 3.8% mixed breed horses. Around one-third of the horses were in large stables and the remaining were from small private stables at their owners. Many of the horses moved around the country and abroad for races, fairs, and exhibitions. Mean age of the animals was 7.9 years (range: 3–19), 59.3% being mares and 40.7% being stallions. Animals had not been vaccinated or presented signs of neurological disorders. Antibody and viral detection Heat-inactivated sera were assayed for anti-WNV immu- noglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by an enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay based on WNV recombinant envelope E (rE) protein (Alonso-Padilla et al. 2010). Briefly, plates were coated with 0.5 lg/well of partially purified rE, blocked, washed, and incubated with horse sera (diluted 1/100) before the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added. After addition of the substrate, the reaction was stopped and the absorbance was read at 495 nm. The positive cutoff value was assigned using a positive/negative (P/N) ratio of q2, calculated by dividing the mean absorbance of the test serum reacted on viral antigen by the absorbance of the negative control serum on viral antigen (Alonso-Padilla et al. 2010). Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) were con- ducted under biosafety level 3 conditions on Vero cells using twofold serial (from 1/40 to 1/1280) sera dilutions (Alonso- Padilla et al. 2009) with the WNV NY-99 strain. In parallel, PRNT was similarly performed with Usutu virus (USUV) strain SAAR 1776 as control of flaviviral specific reactivity. Titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution, diluted at least 1:40, which reduced plaque formation q90% (PRNT90). To detect WNV, samples were assayed by culture on Vero cells (up to three consecutive passages) and by real-time re- verse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction as described elsewhere (Lanciotti et al. 2000). Results Our results showed that 42 (12%) of the sera were IgG positive (average P/N = 4.2, range: 2–10.6). All 42 serum neutralized WNV infectivity (average PRNT90 = 120, range: 42–650), but, with one exception, none of them neutralized USUV (PRNT90 < 40). The only sera that neutralized USUV (PRNT90 = 90) also presented high PRNT and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers against WNV (PRNT90 = 140 and P/N = 10.5, respectively). On the other hand, none of the 30 randomly selected IgG-negative sera tested were PRNT pos- itive for either virus. No virus could be detected by cell culture or real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction in any of the samples analyzed. No differences were observed among the proportion of positive animals detected in the different seasons and a similar proportion of positive animals were observed among mare (13%) and stallions (9.8%). Serum neutralizing antibodies were present in 26.6% of the mixed breed horses, 12.8% of Lipizzaner breed horses, 12.6% of sport animals, and 2.8% of the ponies tested. Positive horses were found in 14 of the 28 municipalities studied, which are up to 200 km distant (Fig. 1). Two of the positive horses were im- ported from Hungary and Croatia, respectively, and were bled while in quarantine. Discussion To date, the only available data about WNV activity in the different republics of the former Yugoslavia are the early re- sults from 1970 to 1980 describing a 0.5%–7.9% ser- oprevalence among its inhabitants (Vesenjak-Hirjan et al. 1991) and a study reporting a low (0.4%) prevalence of anti- WNV antibodies in horses in Croatia in 2002 (Madic et al.

The four positive animals found there were from Dja- kovo region, bordered to the Vojvodina province, sampled in the present study. Our results support that WNV is circulating in the region, as 12% of the horses tested presented specific neutralizing antibodies and were not restricted to any specific region. Two of the seropositive animals had preexisting WNV serum antibody at the time they were imported from neigh- boring countries. One horse presented PRNT90 titers against USUV and WNV. USUV is the only WNV-related flavivirus of the Japa- nese encephalitis serocomplex detected in Europe until now, and neutralizing antibodies against both viruses have been reported in birds (Weissenbock et al. 2002) and sentinel chickens (Lelli et al. 2008). To our knowledge, this is the first time that USUV neutralizing antibodies are reported in horses. However, as PRNT90 titers were similar for WNV and USUV (120 and 90, respectively) and no infectious virus or specific RNA were detected in this serum, we cannot conclude whether this animal presented cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies or was exposed to both viruses. This finding, to- gether with the recent description of coinfection of birds with both viruses (Tamba et al. 2010) and the first human case of USUV neuroinvasive infection in northern Italy (Pecorari et al. 2009), suggests that measures should be taken to monitor USUV activity in Europe and that this should not be restricted to avian species. It should be remarked that presence of WNV seropositive horses does not necessarily mean risk for hu- mans, and in fact, no cases of WND have been reported in the region investigated in the present study. In any case, the re- sults presented here and the worrisome data of WND cases in humans and horses across southern Europe during 2010 (www.ecdc.europa.eu/) advise on the convenience to imple- ment surveillance programs in the region.

218.full.pdf	"SHORT COMMUNICATIONS products were determined by using BigDye chemistry with an ABI Prism Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The specific primer pair for B pilosicoli yielded a PCR prod- uct of the expected size (913 bp) from faecal specimens. Twenty nested PCR products were sequenced and their iden- tity was confirmed as B pilosicoli. A herd was considered pos- itive when at least one of the sampled faeces was positive, which meant that 70 of the 450 faecal samples tested (15-5 per cent) and 40 of the 398 sampled herds (10-1 per cent) were positive for B pilosicoli. The positive herds were distributed throughout the Republic of Korea. The prevalence of positive herds was 8 per cent (two of 25) in Kangwon Province, 9 per cent (seven of 78) in Kyoungsang Province, 9-8 per cent (five of 51) in Cholla Province, 9-9 per cent (14 of 142) in Kyounggi Province, and 11-8 per cent (12 of 102) in Chungcheung Province. These results demonstrate that the nested PCR is a sensitive and reproducible technique and is a promising method to be used as a diagnostic tool for confirming the presence of B pilosicoli in faeces. The faecal samples used in this study were a selected population during a designated period. Although these results probably do not accurately represent the current prevalence on all swine farms, they do indicate that pig farms with positive pigs are widely distributed in Korea. There is a tendency to reduce or eliminate the use of feed-grade antimicrobials in growing and finishing pigs in Korea, and this may have allowed disease associated with B pilosicoli to become more prevalent. The prevalence of PCS varies from one country to another. B pilosicoli mainly affected pigs between eight and 16 weeks of age with a high prevalence of 52 per cent in pig herds in the UK (Thomson and others 1998). In Denmark and Finland, it has been reported that the overall herd prevalence rate was between 30 and 40 per cent (Moller and others 1998, Heinonen and oth- ers 2000). The prevalence of B pilosicoli infection in Korean herds and pigs (10.1 per cent and 15-5 per cent, respectively) appears to be lower than that reported in other countries, and this may be due to the low numbers of samples per herd in this study (Moller and others 1998, Thomson and others 1998, Heinonen and others 2000). Postmortem examination of pigs suspected of having PCS is the best method of making a field diagnosis; however, an advantage of using PCR is that it does not require the euthana- sia of sick animals for necropsy, or the transportation of whole-intestine specimens for diagnosis. A PCR assay of faecal specimens provides a more rapid and accurate method of obtaining a definitive diagnosis of Pcs than anaerobic culture on selective agar medium, one day for PCR results, compared with two to six days for culture (Atyeo and others 1998). PCR may be able to detect the organism before lesions develop or when bacterial cell integrity is lost. However, infected animals do not always shed the organisms; faecal PCR results may depend on the stage or severity of infec- tion. The nested PCR assay may also be useful to identify sub- clinically affected animals in herds where eradication of PCS is being attempted without depopulation. The use of PCR as a monitoring and diagnostic tool could help in the manage- ment of PCS in swine.

WEISSENBOCK THE tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex consists of at least 14 antigenically closely related flaviviruses, eight of which cause human disease (Monath and Heinz 1996). These viruses are only present in the northern hemisphere with a distribution range from Canada, the British Isles, northern and central Europe, to Russia, India and Malaysia (Zanotto and others 1995). In Europe, the representatives of this complex are the west- ern European tickborne encephalitis virus (W-TBEV), which is primarily pathogenic for human beings, and louping ill virus, Spanish sheep encephalitis virus, Greek goat encephali- tis virus and Turkish sheep encephalitis virus with a pre- dominant pathogenic potential for small ruminants (Papadopoulos and others 1971, Gonzalez and others 1987, Reid 1990, Whitby and others 1993, Marin and others 1995, Zanotto and others 1995). All these viruses have a reservoir in small rodents and are transmitted to other warm-blooded hosts by ticks, particularly Ixodes ricinus (Monath and Heinz 1996). In central Europe, including Austria, the only reported representative of the TBE complex is W-TBEV. This virus is Veterinary Record (2002) 150, 2 18-220 Z. Bag6, DVM, B. Bauder, PhD, H.

Domestic and wild-living ruminants are considered to be infected sporadically in a sub- clinical way and may contribute to the maintenance and dis- tribution of the virus (Wyler and Matile 1984, Monath and Heinz 1996). In ruminants, however, clinical diseases with a lethal outcome caused by W-TBEV infections have not been reported. This short communication describes the pathological and immunohistological findings, as well as detection of TBEV nucleic acid by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and par- tial sequence data, of the first confirmed fatal case of W-TBE in a ruminant, a mouflon. In April 1994, a three-year-old male mouflon was found in a moribund condition in a hunting preserve in Burgen- land, the most eastern federal state of Austria. It was killed and submitted for pathological examination. The major macroscopic findings were poor nutritional status and severe infestation with ticks, identified as I ricinus, as well as endoparasites, identified as Dicrocoelium species, Capillaria species, Trichostrongylus species, and Eimeria species. Neuropathological examination revealed marked non- suppurative leptomeningoencephalitis. Most severe inflam- mation was observed in the neuroparenchyma surrounding the fourth ventricle, as well as in the nuclei of pons, cerebel- lar roof and medulla oblongata. In the mesencephalon, thal- amus, hippocampus, basal ganglia and molecular layer of cerebellum, the inflammatory changes were moderate; the cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter and leptomeninges were only slightly affected. Characteristic histological features were necrosis of neu- rons, which were frequently surrounded by reactive microglia leading to numerous neuronophagic nodules. In addition, there was diffuse microglial activation and numerous lym- NCO01 672 TBEV Neudorfl -- U27491 TBEV 263 U39292 TBEV Hypr AF069066 TBEV Vasilchenko NC001809 Louping ill virus phohistiocytic perivascular cuffs. The cerebellum showed multifocal loss of Purkinje cells, together with nodular microgliosis in the molecular layer, so-called glial shrubbery. The leptomeninges were slightly infiltrated with lymphocytes and histiocytes. Immunohistochemical staining with polyclonal antibod- ies against W-TBEV revealed viral antigen in numerous neu- rons and their processes in the neuroparenchyma around the fourth ventricle, as well as in the mesencephalon, thalamus and basal ganglia (Fig 1). In the cerebellum, antigen was pre- sent in single Purkinje cells, including their dendrites. Granular antigen deposits were found extracellularly within areas of glial shrubbery and neuronophagic nodules, as well as intracellularly in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Immunohistochemistry for antigens of other central ner- vous system diseases, for example, rabies, Borna disease, Aujeszky's disease, visna, listeriosis, was negative. In order to detect TBE viral nucleic acid, RT-PCR was per- formed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue from the mouflon. Three 10 [im sections were deparaffinised by incubation with xylene for five minutes at room temper- ature. Following two washings with absolute ethanol and sub- sequent centrifugations, the pellet was subjected to proteinase K digestion for 24 hours at 37°C. Thereafter, RNA was extracted using a purification kit (QIAamp viral RNA purifica- tion kit; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruc- tions. Oligonucleotide primer pairs for RT-PCR were designed in the 4a and 4b non-structural gene region of W-TBEV. The forward primer sequence was 5'-GGACTGGTTGCAGCCAATGA-3' (TBE 1) at position 6895 to 6914 of the TBEV strain Neudorfl (GenBank accession number NC001672) and the reverse primer was 5'-AGATGCCACGGCACTGTTGQA-3' (TBE 4) from position 7128 to 7109 of the same TBEV strain. RT-PCR was carried out using a kit including two reverse transcriptases (Omniscript and Sensiscript Reverse Transcriptase, One step RT-PCR kit; Qiagen) and a hot-start DNA polymerase (HotStarTaq DNA polymerase; Qiagen). The RT-PCR conditions were as follows: reverse transcription for 30 minutes at 50°C, initial PCR acti- vation for 15 minutes at 95°C, denaturation for 20 seconds at 94°C, annealing for 20 seconds at 60°C, and primer exten- sion for one minute at 72°C; 40 PCR cycles were performed with a final extension of 10 minutes at 72°C. Following gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide stain- ing, a clear amplification product of the expected size of 234 bp was visible. The PCR product was excised from the gel, extracted (QlAquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen) and fluores- cence-based sequencing PCR was performed. The PCR product was sequenced in both directions using the automatic sequencing system ABI Prism 310 genetic analyser (Perkin Elmer), and a nucleotide sequence of 132 bp could be read clearly. This sequence was aligned with the sequences of other TBEV strains and with the sequence of louping ill virus avail- able in the GenBank database. The nucleotide sequence obtained from the mouflon TBEV strain revealed an identity of 97 per cent compared with the W-TBEV strain Neudorfl, which was isolated several years ago in the same area (Wallner and others 1995). The sequence similarity to the Siberian TBEV subtype Vasilchenko as well as to louping ill virus was only 86 per cent. To demonstrate the close relationship of the TBEV origi- nating from the mouflon with other W-TBEV strains a phylo- genetic tree was constructed using the programmes contained in the Phylogeny Inference package (PHYLIP version 3.57c, University ofWashington). All sequences of TBEV strains and related viruses in the 4a and 4b non-structural gene region available in the GenBank database were included in the analy- sis. The reliability of the tree was tested by bootstrap resam- pling analysis of 100 replicates. The genetic distance analysis was performed using the FITCH programme from the above package. The sequence of the louping ill virus was used as the The Veterinary Record, February 16, 2002 FIG 1: Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus antigen in neurons and their processes in a mouflon with western European TBE.

D ow nloaded from http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/ SHORT COMMUNICATIONS outgroup. In the phylogenetic tree, the TBEV originating from the mouflon proved to be in a branch formed by central European TBEV isolates, while the Siberian TBEV subtype, as well as the louping ill virus, formed distinct branches (Fig 2). Thus, RT-PCR, sequencing and the phylogenetic analysis con- firmed the presence of W-TBEV nucleotide acid in the brain of the mouflon, and showed a close relationship to, but not identity, to a TBEV strain isolated in the same area a few decades ago. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a fatal case of W-TBE in a ruminant. The neuropathological lesions were largely consistent with TBE in human beings (Grinschgl 1955, Jellinger 1979), dogs (Weissenbock and others 1998) and horses (Waldvogel and others 1981), as well as with loup- ing ill in different species (Pool and others 1930, Doherty and Reid 1971, Doherty and others 1972, Reid 1990). Immuno- staining with polyclonal antibodies to W-TBEV gave a clear positive result. However, the number of positive cells exceeded those in TBE of dogs or louping ill by far (Krueger and Reid 1994, Weissenbock and Holzmann 1997, Weissenbock and others 1998). An explanation for the early death or reduced virus clearance could be the poor body con- dition of the mouflon due to heavy parasitic infestation. As polyclonal antibodies are likely to cross-react with other related flaviviruses and would not have allowed a definitive diagnosis of W-TBE in this animal, RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of part of the viral genome was carried out. These investigations revealed a 97 per cent homology of the sequence with W-TBEV (strain Neudorfl and others) and only 86 per cent homology with louping ill virus (Gao and others 1993a,b, Whitby and others 1993, Zanotto and others 1995, Gao and others 1997). Thus, W-TBEV, the virus of the TBE com- plex which is prevalent in Austria, has been identified as the aetiological agent in this case. References DOHERTY, P. C. & REID, H. W.

In the same area of Northern Italy where USUV human cases occurred in 2009, a regional West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance program based on mosquito monitoring and wild birds screening has been implemented since 2008. Mosquito pools and wild birds were tested using three different polymerase chain reactions (Flavivirus, WNV, and USUV). During summer 2009, 56 pools (54 consisting of Culex pipiens and 2 of Aedes albopictus) and 27 pools (Cx. pipiens) out of 1789 mosquito pools were, respectively, USUV and WNV positive. Moreover, out of 1218 wild birds tested, 44 were WNV positive, whereas only 11 birds were USUV positive by polymerase chain reaction. Data collected during 2009 prove a cocirculation of USUV and WNV in Northern Italy, but these two viruses show different incidence values in both mosquitoes and birds, suggesting involvement of different animals (other bird species or mammals) in their natural cycles. The cocirculation of WNV and USUV poses a new potential threat to human health in this area. The extent of WNV surveillance to other Flaviviruses will require new diagnostic procedures able to process a large number of samples in a limited period of time and highlights the importance of devel- oping more specific serological tests that could be used in field. Key Words: Birds— Flavivirus—Mosquito(es)—West Nile Virus—Usutu Virus. Introduction Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne virus of thefamily Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, belonging to the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, together with Japa- nese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Kunjin virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (Kuno et al. 1998). Isolated for the first time from a bird-biting mosquito (Culex univittatus) in South Africa in 1959 (Williams et al. 1964), USUV was first detected in Europe in 2001, where it caused high mortality in blackbirds around Vienna, Austria (Weissenböck et al. 2002). USUV overwintered and has established a local transmission cycle becoming a resident pathogen, with tendency to spread to other geographic areas (Weissenböck et al. 2003). Actually bird mortality due to USUV infection has been reported in several countries of Central Europe such as Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, and Italy (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Bakonyi et al. 2007, Chvala et al. 2007, Manarolla et al. 2009). Little is known about USUV natural cycle, but it probably involves wild birds and mosquitoes. In Africa, the virus circulates between birds and mosquitoes with mammals being asymptomatic hosts (Gratz 2006). In Europe Culex mosquitoes have been considered to serve as main vectors (Weissenböck et al. 2010), and USUV sequences have been detected in Culex pipiens in Spain (Busquets et al. 2008). During late summer 2009 in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, two cases of USUV neuroinvasive infection in im- munosuppressed patients were reported (Cavrini et al. 2009, Pecorari et al. 2009). Because of WNV circulation with human and horse neuroinvasive cases (Macini et al. 2008, Rossini et al., 2008, Calistri et al. 2009), a regional surveillance plan has been implemented starting from 2008 (Angelini et al. 2010). 1Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy. 2Centro Agricoltura Ambiente ‘‘G.Nicoli,’’ Crevalcore, Italy. 3Department of Hematology and Oncology, Section of Microbiology, Università di Bologna, Bologna, Italy. 4Emilia-Romagna Region Public Health Service, Bologna, Italy. VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES Volume 00, Number 00, 2010 ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/vbz.2010.0055 1 During 2009 WNV surveillance activities have been able to detect USUV circulation in mosquitoes (Calzolari et al. 2009); in this article we report data about simultaneous circulation of both WNV and USUV in mosquitoes and birds in the same area. Materials and Methods Survey areas Emilia-Romagna is a region of Northern Italy that is char- acterized by an intensive agriculture and animal husbandry. The eastern part of the region is located on the Adriatic Sea and includes one of the largest wetland areas of Europe, the Po River Delta. After WNV circulation was detected in 2008 (Macini et al. 2008), almost every floodplain areas of Emilia- Romagna have been put under surveillance. Mosquito collections The surveillance system was activated in the period April 15th–October 15th with weekly to monthly collection of mosquitoes in fixed stations and also in the sites where human or horse neurological cases or WNV-positive birds were detected. Mosquitoes were trapped mainly using modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traps baited with CO2 (Petric et al. 1999) in 92 stations, of which 52 stations had been running for a long time for quantitative monitoring purpose in mosquito control programs (21 sta- tions in Bologna province, 27 stations in Ferrara province, and 4 stations in Ravenna province), while 40 ones were newly planned stations to cover the surveillance area using a grid of 100 km2. Moreover, mosquito collections were promptly performed in sites following the detection of horse and human WNV cases by CO2 and gravid traps. Mosqui- toes were pooled according to date, location, and species, with a maximum number of 200 individuals per pool (Sutherland and Nasci 2007). Pooled mosquitoes were stored in 2 mL polypropylene cryotubes and frozen at �808C. Two 4.3-mm-diameter copper-plated round balls (Haendler & Natermann Sport GmbH, Münden, Germany) and 1.2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline were added to each tube and samples were grinded for 30 s in a vortex mixer, and then 200-mL aliquots were collected from each grinded samples and submitted to biomolecular analysis. Wild birds surveillance Monitoring has been carried out in all the provinces along the Po river, in the plain area of Emilia-Romagna. Every 1600 km2, a monthly sample of about 40 wild birds caught or shot within specific wildlife population control programs was collected. Monitoring was mainly focused on corvids (Pica pica, Corvus corone cornix, and Garrulus glandarius). After detection of USUV, passive surveillance on wild birds was enforced; thus, also birds of other species, such as blackbird (Turdus merula), were tested. Samples of organs (brain, heart, and kidney) of each bird were pooled and submitted to biomolecular analysis. Virological investigation RNAs were extracted using Trizol�LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA synthesis was achieved using random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and SuperScript� II Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pools were analyzed using three different polymerase chain reactions (PCRs): (1) tradi- tional PCR, addressed to a fragment of the NS5 gene, for the detection of Flavivirus genus according to Scaramozzino et al. (2001), (2) traditional PCR for the detection of USUV (Weis- senböck et al. 2002), and (3) real-time PCR for the detection of part of the E gene of WNV according to the method of Tang et al. (2006). Fragments obtained by Flavivirus genus PCR were se- quenced by an automated fluorescence-based technique fol- lowing the manufacturer’s instructions (ABI-PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). As further confirmation a traditional PCR protocol was per- formed on WNV real-time PCR-positive samples using primers originally proposed by Lanciotti et al. (2000). Am- plicons obtained were sequenced as described above. These sequences were employed to confirm the reaction specificity by performing a BLAST search in the GenBank library and to evaluate similarity among detected strains. Calculation of infection rates We used maximal likelihood estimation (MLE) to evaluate USUV infection rates in mosquito collections (Gu et al. 2004). The rates were fortnightly calculated by grouping together pools of the same species and area (province). We calculated MLE infection rates using the PooledInfRate software (Big- gerstaff 2006). Sequence analysis Sequence aligning and phylogenetic analysis with neigh- bor-joining method ( p-distance) of a portion of the NS5 gene (260 bp) amplified by Flavivirus PCR with bootstrap test (1000 Table 1.

Results Mosquitoes About 190,000 mosquitoes were collected during 2009. They were grouped in 1789 pools and tested by PCR (Table 1). Cx. pipiens resulted in the most abundant species (81.4%) followed by Aedes caspius (15.4%), Aedes vexans (2.4%), Aedes albopictus (0.6%), and Culex modestus (0.1%). Other species were also collected and tested such as Aedes geniculatus, Aedes dorsalis, Aedes detritus, Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and Ano- pheles plumbeus. Twenty-seven mosquito pools were found WNV positive, and 56 pools were USUV positive. Eight pools gave positive results for both viruses. Except for two pools of Ae. albopictus USUV positive, all PCR-positive pools consisted of Cx. pipiens (Table 1). The two USUV-positive pools of Ae. albopictus were collected in the same municipality during the same week. Positive pools were detected from July 21st to September 9th and from July 8th to October 3rd for WNV and USUV, respectively. Locations of traps with USUV-positive pools are shown in Figure 1. In the 2008 season about 49,000 mosquitoes were collected in the same area, grouped in 896 pools, and analyzed with the same method, obtaining two Cx. pipiens pools positive for WNV, whereas USUV was not detected (Table 2). Mosquitoes infection rate We calculated USUV MLE infection rates for Cx. pipiens in three areas (provinces of Bologna, Ferrara, and Modena) where 50 out of the 54 USUV-positive Cx. pipiens pools were observed (Table 3). In all areas MLE rates peaked in August. Although the number of individuals tested did not allow a statistical analysis, the highest value (4.1) was recorded in Modena area (weeks 32–33), but in Bologna area USUV cir- culation lasted longer (weeks 26–35). In both areas one USUV neuroinvasive human case was reported (Fig. 1) in August– September 2009 (Cavrini et al. 2009, Pecorari et al. 2009). Nucleotide sequencing and computer analysis Twelve USUV Flavivirus genus PCR amplicons (a 260 bp portion of the NS5 gene) were sequenced and aligned. By eliminating gaps and missing data, a total of 233 positions were considered, which showed an identity percentage ranging from 100% to 98.3% among them (differences ranged from 0 to 4 on a total of 233 positions), and all these differences were silent and did not produce variations in the translated amino acid sequence.

DETECTION OF USUV IN NORTHERN ITALY 3 The highest BLAST scores for the consensus sequence were obtained with USUV isolated in Budapest (EF206350) and USUV strain Vienna 2001 (AY453411). Comparison of con- sensus sequence obtained showed an identity of 97.4% (6 differences on 263 positions) with these two homologous sequences and identity of 96.1% (9 differences on 263 posi- tions) with a South African strain (AF013412) (Fig. 2). Wild birds In 2008 we did not perform PCR to detect USUV, but 45 (9.5%) out of 475 birds tested by PCR were WNV positive. Detailed results have been reported in another article (Calistri et al. 2009). Out of the 1218 birds tested by PCR in 2009, 11 (0.9%) were positive for USUV and 44 (3.6%) for WNV. Three birds (two magpies and one gull) gave positive results for both viruses. Most of infected wild birds were corvids collected between August and October within pop- ulation control programs, but WNV and USUV were also detected in other bird species mainly found dead in wildlife recovery centers (Table 4). USUV-positive birds were sam- pled from August 19th (a magpie caught) to October 26th (a blackbird found dead). Except for a magpie caught in May, WNV-positive wild birds were detected starting from the end of July. The last WNV-positive bird was a jay shot on November 4th. Through passive surveillance USUV was detected also in areas not covered by the WNV surveillance program. Figure 1 shows where USUV-positive birds were collected. Discussion Discussion will be especially focused on USUV, because we have just reported results of WNV monitoring in another article (Angelini et al. 2010), in which the whole surveillance system has been described. USUV has been detected in recent years in Northern Italy (Rizzoli et al. 2007, Lelli et al. 2008, Manarolla et al. 2009), where, as in Central Europe, it can cause neurological lesions and death in birds (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Manarolla et al. 2009). Because of immunosuppressive treatments, USUV Table 2.

In Emilia-Romagna this virus probably shares with WNV the same vector, Cx. pipiens, so its detection during WNV surveillance activities is not amazing. In liter- ature USUV and WNV seem to have similar cycles, but comparing our monitoring results some differences may be evidenced: while we detected more mosquitoe pools PCR positive for USUV than for WNV, more WNV-infected birds were detected than USUV ones, which led to suspect a pos- sible involvement of other animals, such as other bird species or mammals (man included), in the USUV natural cycle. The last hypothesis is enforced by the detection of USUV genome in Ae. albopictus (for the first time to our knowledge), a mosquito considered primarily a mammalian feeder, although shown to fed on a wide variety of hosts. The role of Ae. albopictus in USUV epidemiology has to be considered and further investigated. As reported by Gratz (2006), in Africa USUV was isolated from rodents (Gen. Promys), but in Europe there is a lack of data about a possible involvement of mammals in the virus cycle. However, other hypothesis could explain the differences obtained: for instance, different duration of infection in bird species examined could lead to a different proportion of PCR-positive results. WNV is able to cause persistent infection in birds, in house sparrow (Passer domesticus) viral RNA persisted in tissues through 65 days (Nemeth et al. 2009). In addition Komar et al. (2003) noted that several orders of birds showed different viraemia duration and titer after experimental infection with WNV. Duration of USUV infection in wild birds is still unknown. Moreover, a higher frequency of vertical trans- mission or a higher vector competence for USUV could explain the higher prevalence detected in Cx. pipiens mos- quito pools. All these items will require specific investigation in the next future. As WNV, USUV detection in mosquitoes has happened before occurrence of human cases, so preventive measures, such as mosquito control or blood donors testing, could be possibly organized and performed. As just suggested by Chvala et al. (2007), mosquito moni- toring and screening of wild birds are suitable to detect USUV circulation and could replace dead bird surveillance when bird mortality drops because of herd immunity. Virological surveillance may be preferable against serological monitor- ing, because of cross reactions with other Flaviviruses. Sera reacting to both WNV and USUV were detected in other studies, especially by using low specific tests such as hemagglutination inhibition test (Meister et al. 2008) or en- FIG. 2.

Plaque reduction neutralization test has to be performed to confirm positive sera, but this test is complex, costly, and time consuming. In conclusion, our findings prove a cocirculation of USUV and WNV in Emilia-Romagna region in the 2009 summer season. Our work suggests that it is important to consider other Flaviviruses, such as USUV, for the evaluation of WNV surveillance. Both viruses seem to be able to cause neurolog- ical disease in humans in particular conditions; taken together with the above-reported epidemiological data, the circulation of USUV poses a new potential threat to human health in this area. The expansion of surveillance to other Flaviviruses will require new diagnostic procedures able to process a large number of samples in a limited period of time and highlights the importance of developing more specific serological tests that can be used in field.

Ulrich,3 and Matthias Niedrig1 Abstract Introduction: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes one of the most important flavivirus infections of the central nervous system, affecting humans in Europe and Asia. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation. Method: To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)– quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas. Results: In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas. TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated. Discussion and Conclusion: The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation. Key Words: Distribution—Monitoring—Rodents—Tick-borne encephalitis—Zoonosis. Introduction Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most im-portant flaviviral human diseases in Europe and Asia. The causative agent TBE virus (TBEV) has a positive single- stranded RNA genome of about 11 kilobases and is a member of the tick-borne flavivirus group (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) (Grard et al. 2007, Mansfield et al. 2009). TBEV is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick or, rarely, through nonpasteurized milk products from infected mam- mals (Holzmann et al. 2009). The main vectors of TBEV are ticks of the genus Ixodes: Ixodes persulcatus in Asia and eastern 1Center for Biological Security (ZBS-1), Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany. 2Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, University of South Bohemia, Ceské Budejovice, Czech Republic. 3Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany. 4Landesforstanstalt Eberswalde, Eberswalde, Germany. 5Department of Virology, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany. 6Amt für Landwirtschaft, Flurneuordnung und Forsten Mitte, Außenstelle Wanzleben, Wanzleben, Germany. 7Wildlife Biology and Game Management Team, Department of Forest Zoology and Forest Conservation, Büsgen-Institute, Georg-August- University Göttingen Büsgenweg 3, Göttingen, Germany. *These two authors equally contributed to this work. {Present address: Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany.

During the lifecycle of a tick, TBEV can be transmitted transstadially, transovarially, or primarily from infected ticks to other ticks while cofeeding on the same rodent host (Pfeffer and Dobler 2010). The virus circulates between vector ticks and some of their hosts, mostly deer and small mammals such as rodents and insectivores, whereas only small mammals are presumed to be competent virus reservoir hosts (Mansfield et al. 2009). Larger mammals, such as sheep, cattle, or humans, are accidental hosts, as they develop only a short viremia with low viral titers or no detectable viremia. As a consequence, they are not competent to transmit and spread the virus (Pfeffer and Dobler 2010). In recent years, the incidence of diagnosed TBE cases has increased throughout Europe. In addition, TBEV infections emerged in new areas, for example, southern Sweden, Den- mark, and France, possibly because of socioeconomic or cli- mate changes (Haglund 2002, Bröker and Gniel 2003, Donoso Mantke et al. 2008, Sumilo et al. 2008, Fomsgaard et al. 2009). In Germany, most of the human TBE cases are reported to occur in the southern federal states. Therefore, certain parts of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hesse have been classi- fied as risk areas for TBE (Fig. 1). These risk areas are defined by the incidence of human cases (RKI 2009, 2010). This method of classification might be misleading because of in- creasing vaccination rates in humans, particularly in risk ar- eas, and a resulting decrease in the number of human TBE cases. Additionally, the exposure of humans to ticks might vary substantially in space and time and might thus also in- troduce bias to the current risk-mapping approach (Kiffner et al. 2010). Further, humans are accidental hosts rarely be- coming infected, and quite often an infection will not be rec- ognized because of unspecific symptoms, mild courses of disease, or unawareness of physicians.

Ticks that have frequently been used in prevalence studies are not suitable for TBEV monitoring because infection rates vary greatly between local tick populations. Infections rates are usu- ally below 1% even in highly endemic areas, for example, 0.23% and 0.46% in recent studies from Germany and Switzerland, respectively, implying high costs for collecting and screening (Süss et al. 2004, Gaumann et al. 2010, Kup�ca et al. 2010). Alternatively, terrestrial mammals could be used for TBEV monitoring and the definition of risk areas, as virus or virus- specific antibodies have been detected in nearly all species studied so far (Radda 1973, Wurm et al. 2000, Mandl 2005, Mansfield et al. 2009). In line with these findings, TBEV prev- alence investigations by detecting TBEV-specific antibodies in game animals such as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cattle, and goats) revealed reliable information (Radda et al. 1968, Wurm et al. 2000, Klimes et al. 2001, Juceviciene et al. 2005, Lindhe et al. 2009, Sikutova et al. 2009). However, because of their large activity range as well as a lifespan of several years, the exact time and site of an infection cannot be determined. In contrast, TBE risk analysis based on prevalence studies in small mammals, such as rodents, has advantages. They are widespread in most ecological systems, have a small home range, are easy to trap and monitor, and are heavily parasit- ized by ticks, which probably results in higher TBE virus prevalence (and thus lower associated costs) than in ticks. Once infected with TBEV, they are supposed to develop a persistent infection (Ernek et al. 1963, Kozuch et al. 1963, Nuttall et al. 1994, Danielova et al. 2002, Süss 2003, Bakhva- lova et al. 2006, Gray et al. 2009, Kiffner et al. 2011). Therefore, in this study, we chose rodents as potential sentinels for distribution analysis studies of TBEV. First, lab- oratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally in- fected with TBEV, and selected organs and blood were analyzed for viral RNA and, in part, for virus particles over a period of 100 days postinfection (dpi). The results obtained should provide new information about replication, persis- tence, and organ tropism of TBEV in wild rodents. To assess the suitability of rodents as sentinels for virus spread in nature, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with emerging autochthonous TBE cases, was determined by real-time (RT)–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR). The prevalence was compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas. Materials and Methods Experimental infection of M. arvalis voles and organ sampling Twelve female, adult, outbred M. arvalis voles obtained from the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Uni- versity of South Bohemia, Czech Republic, which underwent several generations under specific-pathogen-free conditions, were infected by subcutaneous inoculation of 1000 plaque forming units of TBEV strain Hypr (GenBank accession number: U39292.1) isolated by Pospisil et al. (1954). At 5, 20, 50, and 100 dpi, two or three animals were killed and dis- sected. Organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney) and blood samples were frozen immediately at - 80�C for later RNA extraction and virus cultivation. Collecting and preparation of samples from rodents Four hundred forty-one wild-living rodents were collected in different federal states of Germany (Fig. 1) between 2002 and 2008 and necropsied according to standard protocols established by the network ‘‘Rodent-borne pathogens’’ (Ul- rich et al. 2008). Briefly, the collected rodents were frozen and stored until necropsy. After identifying the species, weight, size, and sex were determined. During necropsy, spleen and brain tissue for TBEV analysis and additional tissues were taken and stored at - 80�C until further analysis. The species affiliation of TBEV-positive rodents was confirmed by a PCR- based cytochrome b analysis. Isolation of viral nucleic acids Total RNA preparations from whole blood and cell culture supernatant samples were obtained using the peqGOLD blood RNA kit (PeqLab Biotechnology GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) and the Qiagen viral extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Tis- sue samples were first homogenized with Fast-Prep FP120 (eu- bio, Vienna, Austria). Afterward, RNA was extracted according to the protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). Virus detection by RT-qRT-PCR and sequencing To obtain cDNA, 5 lL of the RNA preparation was reverse- transcribed in a 20 lL final reaction volume by Superscript II kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Initially, the RNA was incubated for 10 min at 65�C. The reverse transcription was performed at 37�C for 60 min and at 93�C for 10 min in a Biometra thermoblock cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). cDNA was tested by a TBEV-specific RT-qPCR as previously described (Achazi et al. 2011). Sequencing of TBEV-positive PCR samples was performed using the BigDye� Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus isolation and cultivation Tissue samples were homogenized in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and the homogenate was clarified by cen- trifugation. The obtained supernatant was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586). Cell culture supernatant was harvested at 4 days after inoculation for later RNA extraction. To assess the presence of viable virus in the sample, the in- oculated cell culture was maintained through sequential blind passages over a period of 6 weeks. Detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin G antibodies The detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was done by an immunofluorescence assay from EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the following changes: as secondary antibody, we used the FITC-conjugated goat anti- mouse IgG antibody A90-216F from Bethyl (Montgomery, TX). Samples were diluted 1:10 and 1:100. Statistical analysis Laboratory data were handled and analyzed using PASW Statistics 17 (version 17.0.3; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 643 Results As, at present, the knowledge on TBEV replication, persis- tence, and organ tropism in rodent reservoirs is poor, 11 lab- oratory-bred M. arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV. Selected organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and blood) were taken at four different days over a period of 100 dpi and analyzed by RT-qPCR and, in part, by a virus isolation approach (Table 1). Throughout the whole period of investi- gation, no obvious clinical signs of infection were observed in any of the animals. Beginning at 5 dpi, TBEV genome was found in several organs, that is, brain, spleen, and liver, and at 50 dpi, all organs investigated were found to be RT-qPCR positive (in at least one animal). At the final day of investiga- tion, all three animals were found to be TBEV RNA positive in at least one tissue. Mean copy numbers of the different organs and on different dpi ranged from 4 · 100 to 3 · 106 genome copies per mg organ or mL blood (Table 1). In the TBEV RNA- positive animals, the highest copy numbers were found in the brain at 5 and 20 dpi, but the initial copy number in the brain of > 106 at 5 dpi decreased over time to 101 at 100 dpi. Blood taken at 5 and 50 dpi (of one animal each) was found positive for TBEV genome by RT-qPCR, indicating a viremia in these two animals on these days. In contrast, all blood samples from the three animals at 100 dpi were negative (Table 1). In the control animal, TBEV-specific RNA was not detectable in brain, spleen, kidney, or blood. The persistence of infectious TBEV was confirmed by virus cultivation and subsequent RT-qPCR on cell culture super- natants for three RT-qPCR–positive tissue samples, that is, brain samples from animals at 5 and 100 dpi and a liver sample at 100 dpi (Table 1). The samples were chosen because of their high viral load as well as to prove whether viable virus could be recovered from tissue samples at 100 dpi. A typical cytopathic effect was detected for all the brain tissue–inocu- lated cell cultures at 5 and 8 dpi. In contrast, virus isolation from the liver samples was successful only after two cell passages and an observational period of 28 days until cyto- pathic effect occurred and the supernatant could be tested positive for TBEV genome (Table 1). A clear titer of TBEV-specific IgG antibodies of > 1:10 could be detected in all samples from 5 dpi on over the whole period of investigation. No specific TBEV-IgG antibodies were de- tected in the control animal. To check the suitability of wild-living rodents as sentinels for the spread of TBEV, the prevalence of TBEV was deter- mined in spleen or brain samples from 259 rodents trapped in Brandenburg. This prevalence was compared with that in 137 samples from rodents trapped in TBE risk areas in southern Germany (Hesse) as well as with that in 45 samples from rodents trapped in TBE nonrisk areas in northern and western Germany (Fig. 1). In 45 of 441 (10%) rodents, TBEV RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in brain or spleen. The infection rates varied be- tween 0% and 20% among the 13 trapping sites (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The average TBEV prevalence in TBE risk areas was about 15%. A statistically significant lower infection rate of Table 1.

Sequencing of amplification products was performed, but because of low copy numbers (mean copy number of rodent spleen and brain samples tested positive on TBEV genome by RT-qPCR = 67 copies per mg organ) and the short size of the PCR fragment, the obtained sequence data were of poor quality, so no subsequent subtyping and phylogenetic anal- ysis were possible (data not shown). TBEV genome was detected in rodents of six species, that is, Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvati- cus, Microtus agrestis, M. arvalis, and Myodes glareolus (Table 3). Infection rates in these species ranged from 7% to 29%. No viral RNA could be detected in Mus musculus samples, most likely because of a small sample size (n = 2). Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference (v2 test) in the infection rates of the different species. Interestingly, in the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg, TBEV RNA was detected in five rodent species, with the highest infection rates found in M. glareolus (11%, 8/73), M. arvalis (11%, 2/19), and A. agrarius (11%, 2/19). In the high-risk regions of Hesse and in the nonrisk area of Saxony-Anhalt, three of four investigated rodent species were found to be RT-qPCR positive, with the highest rates in M. glareolus of 18% (11/63) and 9% (2/22), respectively. Remarkably, A. flavicollis showed a higher in- fection rate in Hesse (13%, 9/69) than in Brandenburg (2%, 1/50). Also, there was no statistically significant difference (v2 test) in the infection rates of male (11%, 24/216) versus female (8%, 17/207) rodents or in the body mass of animals found positive or negative for TBEV, respectively. Discussion The results of the experimental TBEV infectivity study in- dicate a persistent infection in M. arvalis. Obvious clinical signs of disease were absent despite high virus titers in the brain. At 5 and 50 dpi, virus was detectable in blood, dem- onstrating a long duration of viremia in some individuals. However, the lack of detection of viral RNA in blood samples drawn at 20 and 100 dpi may suggest an oscillation of the viral load in blood. This assumption might be in line with the previously reported short-term viremia found in other mammalian (including human) hosts (Ernek et al. 1963, Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981, Schultze et al. 2007, Holzmann et al. 2009). The oscillation and vari- ability in the process of infection in individual voles could be attributed to the variable genetic background of the outbred animals. Experimental TBEV infections in conventional in- bred laboratory M. musculus–derived lines, such as Swiss Albino or BALB/c mice, had a lethal outcome within 1–3 weeks as these mice suffer from a mutation in the Oas 1b gene, which is supposed to be an interferon-induced effector gene (Lindenbach and Rice 2001, Mandl 2005, Růžek et al. 2008). The presented results prove that TBEV persists for at least 3 months in different organs and for > 1 month in the blood of M. arvalis; however, virus titers decreased over time, partic- ularly in the brain. These results support former studies with other rodent species (M. glareolus and A. flavicollis) in which TBEV could be detected in blood only up to 5 dpi and in organs only up to 30 dpi by classical methods (Ernek et al. 1963, Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981). Besides the different rodent species used in these studies, the prolonged detection of TBEV RNA as well as viable virus in the present study might be related to improved cultivation techniques and the use of highly sensitive RT-qPCR diag- nostic methods. Also, anti-TBEV IgG antibodies could be detected from 5 dpi on over the whole 3 months. These results indicate a normal immune response in the infected animals. It might be interesting to analyze antibody titers over a longer period than 3 months because in a former study with rodents from Finland (Tonteri et al. 2011), antibodies could only be detected in 2 of 16 rodents whose brain tissue tested positive for Eu- ropean TBEV RNA. The findings of the experimental study and the detection of TBEV RNA in wild-living M. arvalis presented here supports a previous study by Nosek et al. (1970) proposing M. arvalis as a reservoir for TBEV. In line with these findings, related rodent species such as M. agrestis and M. glareolus were also found to contain TBEV RNA. TBEV RNA-positive M. glareolus voles were trapped not only in the TBE risk area in Hesse but also in the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Fur- ther, in all trapping sites, M. glareolus voles showed the highest infection rates. These results suggest that this species might be the most important host for TBEV in Germany. In Brandenburg, M. arvalis and A. agrarius showed similar infection rates and therefore seem to be important hosts in this federal state. In contrast, in Hesse, A. flavicollis showed the second highest infection rate of about 10% and therefore may substitute the role of A. agrarius and M. arvalis in the western parts of Germany. This is especially interesting because the geographical distribution of A. agrarius is restricted to the eastern part of Germany (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999). Because of high variation in sample size and sampling sites of species in this initial study, the significance of the observed differences in infection rates between different rodent species has to be corroborated in future large-scale screening studies. Altogether, previous investigations and our present study suggest TBEV to be rather nonreservoir specific. The reasons and mechanisms for this apparent unspecific virus–host interaction are interesting issues for further investigations (Kozuch et al. 1981). Table 3.

RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 645 The detection of TBEV RNA in rodents from four of five districts of the federal state of Brandenburg and both inves- tigated districts of Saxony-Anhalt raises questions on the definition of risk areas, as these regions have not been clas- sified as risk areas so far (RKI 2009, 2010). In future, based on the number or proportion of infected rodent specimens per area, a modified classification would be possible. Taking into account the geographical distribution of the districts (Fig. 1), it becomes evident that the trapping sites with rodents tested positive for TBEV and previously classified as TBE nonrisk areas are located in or near areas with autochthonous TBE cases (light gray). In contrast, rodents trapped in a park in the city center of Cologne (far away from TBE risk areas) are found to be free of TBEV. In Germany, the overall prevalence of TBEV-positive ro- dents averaged at 10%. Therefore, Germany seems to be a country of low TBE risk in comparison to a prevalence of 61% in rodents of a high endemic area in Siberia (Bakhvalova et al. 2006). This rating is supported by the low incidence of human TBE cases in Germany compared with other European countries, for example, the Czech Republic or Russia (Donoso Mantke et al. 2008). In general, the infection rates vary strongly among the different trapping sites. These variations are consistent with the fact that TBEV are concentrated in so-called ‘‘natural foci,’’ habitat sites limited to a few square meters or square kilo- meters (Pavlovsky 1966, Zeman 1997, Gritsun et al. 2003, Süss 2003, Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008), but could also be led back by seasonal fluctuations, which could not be considered because of missing data. This investigation provides further direct evidence of TBEV in Brandenburg (northeastern Germany) and is in line with case reports on human TBE patients in Brandenburg (Süss et al. 1996, 2008, Becker et al. 2006, RKI 2009, 2010). Further, the results demonstrate that TBEV is endemic in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, federal states that have not been previously classified as risk areas. This finding has important implications for public health policy regarding vaccination strategies, awareness training, and the definition of risk areas for TBEV. We conclude that TBEV detection in rodents represents a promising surrogate marker system for TBE, particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation. Rodents are easy to capture, show a persistent TBEV infection, and are ubiquitous in all ecological systems. Future investigations should assess the value and accuracy of this approach by parallel investigations of ticks, rodents, or other host animals in high and low TBE risk areas in Germany.

ABSTRACT: During 1988 and 1989, a serologic survey of wildlife was conducted in northeast- ern Mexico to determine the presence, preva- lence, and distribution of arboviruses and other selected disease agents. Eighty mammal speci- mens were tested. Antibodies to vesicular sto- matitis-Indiana, Venezuelan equine encephali- tis-Mena II, Rio Grande virus, and vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey were detected predomi- nately in small mammals. Deer and mouflon (Ovis musimon) had antibodies to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Two species had serologic evidence of recent exposure to Francisella tularensis. A white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) had antibodies to An- aplasma marginale. All specimens tested for an- tibodies against Yersinia pestis and Brucella abort us were negative. Sera from 315 birds were tested for antibody against five equine enceph- alitis viruses and six avian pathogens. During 1988, antibodies to Venezuelan equine enceph- alitis-Mena II, Venezuelan equine encephalitis- TC83, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine en- cephalitis, and western equine encephalitis were detected in birds of several species. Antibodies to Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease virus were also detected. Birds from five species presented antibodies to Mycoplasma meleagri- dis. Specimens tested for M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chiamydia psittaci were nega- tive. To the best of our knowledge, this survey represents the first serologic evidence of blue- tongue, Cache Valley virus, epizootic hemor- rhagic disease, Jamestown Canyon virus, vesic- ular stomatitis-Indiana, vesicular stomatitis- New Jersey, Rio Grande virus, and tularemia reported among wildlife in Mexico. Key words: Arboviruses, avian cholera, dis- ease survey, Newcastle disease, tularemia, wild- life. Much of the information known about diseases in wildlife has been aquired from serologic surveys. A number of factors, however, such as viremia titer and dura- tion, antivector behavior, and longevity may bias results. Another limitation of se- rology includes the size and distribution of the samples. Samples from a single flock or herd may be insufficient. Also, the trap- ping technique may bias the composition of the collection, resulting in a non-rep- resentative sample of wildlife tested. De- spite these limiting factors, serologic sur- veys are considered important in that they reveal evidence of the presence of disease when apparent infections and clinical cases have not been detected. Also, presence of selected disease agents may be determined when limited information is known about a specific disease in a geographic area. The prevalence of arboviruses in wild vertebrates in Mexico has been previously documented (De M ucha-Macias, 1963; Campillo-Sainz, 1969; Scherer et al., 1971; Dickerman et al., 1972b). Other disease agents have been reported from wildlife in that country. For example, Varela and Vazquez (1954) isolated Yersinia pestis from spleens of Mexican prairie dogs (Cynomys mexicanus) trapped in the State of Coahuila, demonstrating for the first time that sy!vatic plague was present in Mexico. However, we know of no serologic Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use 436 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 28, NO. 3, JULY 1992 FIGuRE 1. Study areas from which serum samples were collected from wildlife for serologic survey, Mexico 1988-89. surveys performed in wildlife in Mexico since that time. The objective of this study was to determine, through a serologic sur- vey, the presence and prevalence of ar- boviruses and other potential pathogens in resident wildlife species from northeastern Mexico. The study areas, located in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, Republic of Mexico (Fig. 1), have been previously described (Bennett et a!., 1991). Mammals and birds were captured in all study areas from 18 May to 8 August 1988 and 10 June to 11 August 1989. Capture techniques and field procedures used in this study were similar to those described by Sudia et al. (1970). Sherman traps and leghold traps for mammals were operated for not more than 3 days in the same study area and were visited once a day early in the morning. An average of 41 Sherman trap-nights and five leg-hold trap-nights were used during a 65-day period over the two summers. Carnivores and other large mammals were chemically immobilized with ketamine (Ketaset, Bristol Labora- tories, Syracuse, New York 66201, USA) at recommended dosages (Jessup, 1982). At the time of this survey, several wild-caught species were temporarily held in corrals and pens at Rancho San Francisco, Coa- huila. For the purposes of this study, a wild-caught captive animal included any mammal or bird held in captivity for a week or longer. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at ground level for a total of 560 net hours (1 net hr = one 12-m mist net operated for 1 hr of daylight) (McLean et a!., 1989). Nets were checked every 2 hr. Mist nets were set for 1 to 3 days on the study sites from 8:00 to 17:00 each day. Waterfowl and other birds species were manually captured in nesting boxes or while on ground nests (Markum and Ba!- dassarre, 1989a, b). A number of nesting black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocyg- na autumnalis) were captured by hand at night using a spotlight. Blood specimens (0.5-10 ml) were taken by venipuncture from the heart, radial, tarsal or jugular veins, allowed to clot and refrigerated overnight at 4 C. After blood specimens were centrifuged, sera were re- moved, placed in vials and frozen on dry ice. In the laboratory, serum specimens were heat-inactivated at 56 C for 30 mm and tested by the plaque-reduction neu- tralization test (McLean et a!., 1985, 1989) for antibody against the following arbo- viruses: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) (TBH- 28 strain), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) (NJ-160 strain), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) (TC83, lAB strain and Mena II, 1E strain), western equine en- cephalitis (WEE) (Fleming M I-2959B strain), vesicular stomatitis-Indiana (VSV- In) (lab strain), vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey (VSV-NJ) (Haze!hurst strain), epi- zootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) (New Jersey strain), bluetongue (BT) [BT-13 (67- 41B) and BT-17 strains], Cache Valley vi- rus (CV) (M23355 strain), Jamestown Can- yon virus (JC) (61V2235 strain), Nepuyo virus (NEP) (HBL7-2BG strain), and Rio Grande virus (RG) (TBM4-719 strain). Samples presenting a linear neutralization index of � 100.8 log of plaque counts com- pared with controls were considered pos- Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use SHORT COMMUNICA11ONS 437 itive (McLean et a!., 1985, 1989). The pas- sive hemagglutmnation test and passive hemagglutination inhibition control test were used to detect antibodies against Y. pestis (Wolff and Hudson, 1974). Titers � 16 were considered indicative of expo- sure. The micro-agglutination test was used to detect antibodies against Francisella tu- larensis. Titers � 128 were considered to provide evidence of previous exposure (Stewart, 1988). Serum specimens from ungulate species were submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Brucellosis Laboratory (Denver, Colorado 80211, USA) for the detection of antibodies against Brucella abortus and Ana plasma margin- ale. Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease virus antibodies were tested by us- ing the ELISA Antibody Test Kit (Agritech Systems, Inc., Portland, Maine 04101, USA). Values for samples to known posi- tive (S/P) ratio of �0.2 were considered as not providing evidence of previous ex- posure. Bird specimens obtained in 1988 were submitted to the National Animal Health Reference Laboratory (Ames, Iowa 50010, USA) to test for serologic evidence of exposure to Myco plasma meleagridis, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chla- mydia psittaci. Serum samples obtained during summer 1989 were tested for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae antibodies by the stained antigen rapid plate agglu- tination test (Intervet America Inc., Mills- boro, Delaware 19966, USA). Serum specimens from 80 mammals of 14 families and 21 species were tested for antibody against 13 selected arboviruses, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. abortus, and A. marginale. Results for serologic tests for arboviral antigens in mammals are listed in Table 1. During 1988, 12 species from San Francisco presented antibodies to VSV-NJ and seven species had antibody to VSV-In. Of these, six species presented antibodies to both viruses. In 1988, anti- bodies to enzootic strain VEE-Mena II were present in seven species predomi- nated by small mammals. Antibody to VEE-TC83 strain was detected in three species including deer and two species of lagomorphs. From all the ruminants tested in 1988, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus vir- ginianus texanus) was the only species with serologic evidence of exposure to both BT serotypes and EHD. During 1989, two of six mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon) had an- tibodies to BT. All other ungulate sera test- ed negative to hemorrhagic disease. Desert cottontail (Sylvilagus auduboni) was the only species with serologic evidence to NEP (1/6). Jackrabbits (Lepus calif ornicus) (3/ 10) and a striped skunk (Mephitis me phi- tis) trapped during summer 1988, had di- agnostically significant titers (128) to F. tularensis. A white-tailed deer serum had serologic evidence of exposure to A. mar- ginale. There was no evidence of exposure to Y. pestis and B. abortus in the mam- malian specimens tested. Sera from 315 birds of 24 families and 44 species were tested for antibody to five arboviruses and six other selected avian pathogens (Table 2). During summer 1988, birds from 14 species had serologic evi- dence to the enzootic strain of VEE-Mena II. Antibodies to P. multocida were de- tected in five bird species in 1988 and two bird species in 1989. Newcastle disease vi- rus antibodies were also identified in two species for both years. A scaled quail (Cal- lipepla squamata) had a positive titer of 160 to M. meleagridis. No serologic evi- dence to selected arboviral antigens was found in 27 species of birds. Birds from 18 species had no antibodies to avian cholera and Newcastle disease. No serologic evi- dence of exposure to M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae and C. psittaci was identified in the bird specimens tested. The present study indicates that trans- mission of at least 12 arboviruses occurred prior to the summers of 1988 and 1989 in the mammal species tested in northeastern Mexico. Previous evidence of exposure to equine encephalitis viruses in wild and do- mestic mammals has been reported in Mexico (Scherer and Dickerman, 1972; Gonzalez-Cortes et a!., 1975).

Our survey identified an- tibodies to VEE in a cottontail rabbit, a white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leuco- pus), and a raccoon (Procyon lotor), spe- cies with historical serologic or virologic evidence to VEE in Mexico. This survey identified five new species with serologic evidence to VEE in Mexico including striped skunk, white-tailed deer, kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), woodrat (Ne- otoma mexicana), and jackrabbit. It is un- known, however, if all of these species act as effective reservoir hosts. Nepuyo virus was isolated for the firsttime in Mexico in 1966 (Dickerman et al., 1971). There is evidence that this virus is widely distrib- uted and can cause epidemics in humans similar to dengue. The present study pro- vides the only serologic evidence of this arbovirus in cottontails in Mexico since that year.

During the present survey, three of five blackbuck (Antilope cervi- capra) obtained from Texas were seropos- itive to VS V-NJ. These animals were sam- pled the same day they arrived at Rancho San Francisco, Coahuila. These results may indicate activity of VSV in Texas. The im- plications of disease movement caused by wildlife translocations should be consid- ered. Although virus isolation was not at- tempted, the introduction of VSV into Mexico is a possibility. VSV is indigenous to the western hemisphere and epizootics have occurred in southeastern United States almost every year (Karstad, 1981). There is extensive serologic and virologic evi- dence of BT virus infection in domestic livestock from Mexico (Stott et a!., 1989). This study confirms exposure of white- tailed deer to BT-13 and BT-17, strains previously isolated in Mexico. To the best of our knowledge this is the first confirmed report of serologic evidence to EHD, VS- NJ, VS-In, CV, JC, and RG in wildlife in Mexico. These arboviruses are enzootic in areas of the United States bordering Mex- ico (Karabatsos, 1985). Tularemia titers obtained in jackrabbits and a skunk indicate that the disease may be active in Mexico. Implications to hu- man health are important since it is known that jackrabbits are a source of food to people in Mexico. To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the first serologic evidence of tularemia reported in wild mammals from Mexico. The present study indicates that the bird species sampled were exposed recently to four encephalitis viruses, of which three have been reported previously in Mexican birds. Campillo-Sainz (1969) found herons and egrets from five species with antibod- ies to SLE and WEE. SLE was isolated from water birds in Veracruz, Mexico (Dickerman et a!., 1972a). The present sur- vey of waterbirds identified similar num- bers of reactors to the ones previously re- ported for VEE in resident birds collected in southeastern Mexico (Dickerman et al., 1972b). It isknown that some mammals and birds may develop persistent viremias and act as amplifying hosts of these diseases in epi- zootic situations (Dickerman et a!., 1972b; McLean and Bowen, 1980; McLean et al., 1985). At least three of the equine en- cephalitis viruses (EEE, SLE, and VEE) have caused epidemics in humans and epi- zootics in horses in Mexico. The role of wildlife in any of these outbreaks is un- known. Birds appear to be particularly im- portant in the ecology of arboviral diseases. Mammals play an incidental role in the natural cycle, but this fact does not exclude the possibility of infection during epizootic situations. SLE and other flaviviruses have been present in Mexico for many years (Sosa-Martinez, 1963). To the best of our knowledge this is the first laboratory con- firmed serologic report of EEE in wild birds in Mexico. Further studies in the prevalence, transmission, and ecology of selected diseases in wildlife populations in Mexico are required. Increasing data on disease agents in a greater number of spe- cies and scattered locations raise questions regarding the possibilities of disease intro- duction and exchange between geograph- ical areas. There is supported evidence of annual reintroduction of arboviruses from areas south of the United States by migra- tory birds (Stamm and Newman, 1963; Calisher et a!., 1971; Dickerman et al., 1980). Surveillance for currently known dis- eases and isolation of new etiologic agents can be the initial attempt to establish the laboratory confirmed status of selected dis- eases in Mexico. The systematic collection of samples to establish the presence of dis- ease is essential in the continental man- agement of migratory species as well as other wildlife in North America.

Aitken-1956-The isolation of Ilheus virus from.pdf	"THE ISOLATION OF ILH@US VIRUS FROM WILD CAUGHT FOREST MOSQUITOES IN TRINIDAD' C. R. ANDERSON, T. H. G. AITKEN AND W. G. DOWNS The Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, British West Indies IlhÃ©usencephalitis virus was originally isolated from the vicinity of IlhÃ©us (Bahia), Brazil by Laemmert and Hughes (1947). The agent was recovered on one occasion from a pool of Aedesâ€”Psorophora mosquitoes of which the pre@. dominant species were Aedes serratus and Psorophora ferox. Successful trans mission was effected in the laboratory to baby mice through the bites of Aedes aegypti, Aedes serratus and Psorophora ferox. Neutralizing antibodies to IthÃ©us virus were also demonstrated in the sera of two rhesus monkeys, one laboratory worker and several residents of the IlhÃ©usarea. Until the present report, IlhÃ©us virus had never been reisolated in nature and all work with the agent had stemmed from the original Brazilian strain. Recent immunity surveys in Trinidad, B.W.I., have revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IlhÃ©usvirus in a high percentage of the sera collected from certain regions of the island (Downs, Anderson and Theiler, 1956). Ac cordingly, a study was undertaken of the epidemiological aspects of IlhÃ©usvirus infection in man, and intensive efforts were made to isolate the virus from human beings and mosquitoes. The details of the isolation of two virus strains from mosquitoes and the identification of them as strains of IlhÃ©usvirus are reported below. ISOLATION The first strain (TRVL Specimen No. 5800) was isolated from a collection of 75 mosquitoes representing eight genera (see Table 1). The mosquitoes were captured in the Melajo Forest about seven and a half miles north of Sangre Grande, Trinidad, B.W.I., on September 13, 1954. The pool of mosquitoes was ground in a mortar and suspended in 9 ml. of bovalbumin diluent.2 The suspen sion was centrifuged in a 4Â°C.cold room for 30 minutes at about 10,000 RPM in an angle-head centrifuge. The supernatant fluid was removed and 0.03 ml. of it was inoculated, intracerebrally, into each of six 3â€”4-week-oldSwiss mice. A portion was also stored in the dry ice box in a sealed glass ampoule. After an incubation period of from five to six days, five of the mice showed definite signs of illness. Three of the mice were sacrificed and suspensions prepared from their brains were passaged into groups of adult mice. An agent of high virulence for â€˜Thestudies and observations which this paper is based upon were conducted with the support and under the auspices of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme and The Rockefeller Foundation. 2 The diluent is composed of: 0.12 molar sodium chloride; 0.006 molar monobasic sodium phosphate; 0.012 dibasic sodium phosphate; and 0.75% fraction 5 bovalbuinin. The pH is adjusted to between 6.8 and 7.3 by the addition of 0.3 molar sodium hydroxide solution. The diluent is sterilized by filtration through a Seitz EK pad. 621 Skal,, 5800 (Melajo Forest)Sfrain 6851 (CharumaForest)Mosquito speciesNumbersMosquitospeciesNumbersPsorophora ferox albipes Aedes serratus scapularis hortator 22 6 18 10 2Psorophora ferox albipes cingulata Total 89 2 52 143fulvus Culex spissipes sp Mansonia venezuelensis...1 2 2 1Anopheles homunculus....

The agent passed readily through a bacteria-tight Seitz EK pad. The virus rapidly became adapted to mice and no significant change in the 4-day incubation period was noted from the second to the sixty-eighth passage. The virus was capable of producing death of adult mice following the intraperitoneal inoculation of large doses. The virus was successfully reisolated from the sample of the original mosquito suspension stored in the dry ice box. The second strain (TRVL Specimen No. 6851) was isolated from a collection of 143 mosquitoes representing three species of Psorophora (Table 1). The mos quitoes were captured at the end of the Charuina Road in the Charuma Forest, Tabaquite, Trinidad, B.W.I., on October 12, 1954. The Charuma Road site where these mosquitoes were caught is about 22 miles (crow flight) from the Melajo Forest collection site, almost in the geographical center of the island. The mosquito suspension was prepared in the same manner as the one described above, except that the total volume of bovalbumin diluent employed was 12 ml. A group of six young adult mice was inoculated intracerebrally and a sample was stored in the dry ice box. Three of the inoculated mice showed obvious signs of illness on the eighth post-inoculation day. Inoculation of normal mice intra cerebrally with brain suspensions prepared from the brains of two of the sick mice reproduced the disease, and the agent was easily maintained in passage by this technique. The agent passed readily through a bacteria-tight Seitz EK pad. This agent did not adapt as readily to mice as did the first strain. The incubation period for the first few passages was six to seven days, and often one or two of the mice survived the inoculation of a ten per cent brain suspen ISOLATION OF ILH@IJS VIRUS 623 sion. The incubation period gradually decreased to four days on continued passage and the virus became more uniformly lethal for the mice. The 6851 strain likewise produced a fatal infection in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a large amount of virus. Reisolation of this agent from the original mos quito suspension has not been attempted. IDENTIFICATION The recent immunity survey in Trinidad revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to a number of viral agents in the sera of various residents of the island (Downs et at., 1956). Accordingly, specific antisera against these agents were sent from The Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratories in New York to aid in the identification of viruses isolated in Trinidad. Immune sera to the following viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize strains 5800 and 6851: Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis; St. Louis; IlhÃ©us; yellow fever; Bunyamwera; Mengo; and Semliki Forest. In these tests over 100 MLD50 of each virus was present. The results suggested that the two strains might be strains of IlhÃ©usvirus. In the case of the 6851 virus, IlhÃ©usimmune serum protected all of the mice, whereas none of the other sera in the test af forded any protection. The test with the 5800 virus was not so clear-cut, but the delay in incubation period and time of death of the mice receiving virus plus IlhÃ©usimmune serum was suggestive of protective effect. Working from this lead, rabbits, which were found to be susceptible to flhÃ©us virus by Koprowski and Hughes (1946), were inoculated intraperitoneally with infected mouse brain suspensions of the original Brazilian IlhÃ©usstrain and the 5800 and 6851 strains in order to produce specific antisera to each. Sufficient preinoculation serum was collected from each rabbit to serve as a control in the tests employing the corresponding immune serum. The rabbits were exsan guinated between one and two months after inoculation. All sera were stored in sterile lusteroid tubes at â€”20Â°C. The neutralizing capacity of each antiserum for each of the viruses was studied. In these tests tenfold dilutions of virus were mixed with an equal volume of undilutedrabbitimmune serum. A controltitration,employing the pre-im munization serum from the same rabbit, was made simultaneously. The sera were not inactivated. The serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37Â°C.for an hour, after which they were kept in an ice bath during the time of inoculation. The serum-virus mixtures were inoculated intracerebrally into groups of six young adult mice. Titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938). The neutralizing capacity was calculated as the difference between the titer of the virus in the pre-immunization sera and the post-immunization sera, and is recorded as the logarithm of the number of 50 per cent end point doses (MLD 50's) neutralized. Results of these tests are summarized in Table 2. The data show that each of the antisera neutralized significant amounts of each virus, and, taken as a whole, indicate that the agents were sufficiently similar to be considered as strains of the same virus.

When tested for their ability to agglutinate baby chick red blood cells, all three strains showed optimum reactions at pH 6.8 and 4Â°C.The Brazilian IlhÃ©usand 6851 strains agglutinated beyond an antigen dilution of 1:3,200, while two different batches of strain 5800 had end points at 1:200 and 1:800 respectively. While such variations may be caused by in herent differences in strains, it is also possible that the time of harvesting the mouse brains may play a considerable part in determining the potency of anti gen, and timing of the harvesting is difficult to standardize. SUMMARY Two strains of virus, isolated in 1954 from forest mosquitoes in Trinidad, B.W.I., have been shown by reciprocal cross-neutralization tests to be strains of IlhÃ©usvirus. Both strains produce a hemagglutinating antigen, similar in reactivity to the antigen produced from the known IlhÃ©usstrain. These isola tions represent the second and third times the virus has been found in nature. ADDENDUM Since submitting this paper for publication, four more IlliÃ©usvirus isolations from Trinidad mosquitoes have been made by the laboratory. All isolations were made in two-day-old mice inoculated with mosquitoes caught in the Rio Grande Forest about eight miles northeast of Sangre Grande. Strain one (TRVL speci men No. 10507) came from a mixed pool of 105 mosquitoes (21 species in nine genera) collected 16/XII/55; strain two (TRVL specimen No. 10554) came from a mixed pool of 233 mosquitoes (17 species in eight genera) collected 23/XII/55; strain three (TRVL specimen No. 10584) came from a mixed pooi of 103 mos quitoes (13 species in seven genera) collected 3/1/56; and the fourth strain (TRVL specimen No. 10654) was isolated from a pool of seven Psorophoraferox collected 10/1/56. All of the mixed pools contained reasonably large numbers of Aedes and Psorophora species except No. 10584 which had 30 Aedes (serratws) and only one Psorophora (lutzi).

Histopathologic lesions and molecular genetics identifi ed a new strain of louping ill virus, 94% identical to the strain from Britain. Surveillance is needed to minimize risk to domestic and wildlife species and humans. Louping ill is a zoonotic disease caused by a neurotropic, single-stranded, 40 to 50–nm RNA virus, which has been classifi ed in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Louping ill virus belongs to a subgroup antigenically related to viruses known as the tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEVs) of Europe (1). These viruses are medically considered to be the most common fl aviviruses in Europe and Asia (2). Among them, the TBEVs, which infect thousands of humans per year (3), are related to louping ill virus. Most reports of louping ill virus originate from the British Islands; knowledge with regard to the strain from Spain is limited. Because it is a tick-transmitted disease, the distribution of louping ill is closely associated with the distribution of the primary vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus. It mainly affects sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but many other species have been reported to be susceptible, including dogs, llamas, alpacas, goats, pigs, and humans (2). Infection with a strain of louping ill virus from Spain was fi rst reported for sheep in the Basque region of northern Spain in 1987. For several years during the spring, mortality rates for lambs and yearlings in infected fl ocks were high (4). The causative agent was identifi ed as Spanish sheep encephalitis virus (SSEV) (5). Additional studies failed to isolate the virus from ticks (6) in the region where the fi rst cases occurred, indicating that prevalence of SSEV, if present, was low. To our knowledge, no cases of encephalitis caused by a fl avivirus in ungulates in Spain have been described since then. Also to our knowledge, no cases of tick-borne fl avivirus infection in humans have been reported in Spain, although 1 case of tick-borne encephalitis in a person from southwestern France was considered to have been caused by an SSEV subtype virus (3,7). Therefore, except for the 1 person in France, SSEV infections seem to be restricted to sheep and to the Basque region of northern Spain. We report suspected infection of a herd of Bermeya goats (an endangered breed of Asturian goats) with a TBEV. The Cases In September 2011, a herd of 70 adult goats was purchased in southern Asturias and then moved to northern Asturias. Within 1 month, 1 goat became ill. The fi rst sign was hindleg lameness, which quickly progressed to incoordination, fever, tremors, and bulging eyes. The goat died 2 days later, after which 17 other goats (including 2 goatlings born on the farm) showed the same signs and died over a 4-month period. Many ticks were found on these animals (≈10–15 ticks/goat), and Butox (Merck, Madrid, Spain) was applied. Necropsy was performed on 2 adult goats; gross lesions were recorded and special attention was paid to the nervous system. Samples for histopathologic examination were taken from the brain (cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, and brain stem), spinal cord, liver, kidney, adrenal glands, lungs, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. They were fi xed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and 4-μm hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections were produced. Samples of brain tissue were also taken for molecular analysis. Total RNA was extracted (TRIzol reagent; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), treated with DNase 1 (Takara Bio Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA by using random hexamers (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [avian myeloblastosis virus]); Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Real- time RT-PCR primers designed to detect all viruses in the family Flaviviridae (8) were used in a conventional RT-PCR protocol, and a 231-bp amplicon was detected and sequenced (BigDye Terminator, version 3.1, Cycle Sequencing Kit protocol; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). To compare the phylogenetic relationships of the isolate virus with other representative TBEV strains, we constructed an unweighted pair-group method analysis tree in MEGA 5 (9), by using published TBEV sequences (8) and the Three Arch Rock Island strain of Tyuleniy virus as an outgroup. During necropsy of the 2 goats, no gross lesions were found. No histopathologic lesions were found in any organ system except the central nervous system (Figure 1).

Marreros) DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1806.120220 Louping Ill in Goats, Spain cerebellum showed necrosis of Purkinje cells and neurons. Histopathologic examination of the rest of the brain revealed a mild meningeal infi ltration with widespread lymphocytic perivascular cuffs and evidence of neurophagia and gliosis, characterized by degenerating neurons surrounded by glia cells. These lesions were concentrated in the hypothalamus and midbrain and were more severe in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. The histopathologic lesions observed in these goats were indistinguishable from those caused by louping ill virus (10). Molecular genetic studies enabled identifi cation of the virus. The sequence (Genbank accession no. JQ646028) was 94% identical to the strain from Britain (EU074000) and 93% identical to the strains from Spain (EU074016) and the Negishi virus (EU074002), thus confi rming identity of the Asturian strain louping ill virus. Phylogenetic analysis, conducted by using the unweighted pair-group method analysis tree (Figure 2) shows how the new virus strain is related to the strains from Britain and Spain. Conclusions Histopathologic lesions together with molecular genetic results enabled a defi nitive diagnosis: tick-borne encephalitis caused by an Asturian strain of louping ill virus. These cases confi rm the infection in species other than sheep in Spain and the presence of the virus in areas of northern Spain other than the Basque region. An epidemiologic survey confi rmed that no clinical signs were observed for the source herd in southern Asturias. However, a few years ago, another herd, located in the same area to which the affected herd described here had been moved, showed similar signs; 8 of 20 goats died. Although a diagnosis was not confi rmed for this earlier outbreak, the facts suggest that the virus might have been in this area for several years.

Numerous cases of human infection have been described (11). Humans can become infected in a variety of ways. Infections have been naturally acquired in persons who had direct contact with infected animals, for example on the farm or in laboratory settings (11,12). The virus can also be transmitted by direct mucous or respiratory pathways. Another route for infection is the consumption of milk from infected goats or products (cheese, butter, or yogurt) made from milk from infected goats (13). The presence of the virus in milk could represent a public health hazard if the milk is not pasteurized. The Bermeya goat is considered to be at high risk for extinction, and many efforts have been made by breeders and the local administration of agriculture to limit the loss of genetic variability in these goats. The cases reported here provide an example of how an infectious disease can also reduce the local genetic resources. These cases, together with the case described in the Basque region, underline the need for a specifi c surveillance plan in northern Spain that focuses on ticks, wildlife species, and livestock. This plan will be crucial for determining the actual effects of louping ill on hunting, animal breeding, and human health.

BARDOS,1 W. SIXL,2 C. L. WISIDAGAMA,3 J. HALOUZKA,l D. STUNZNER,2 Z. HUBALEK,' & H. WITHALM2 The sera of cattle, goats, dogs and crowsfrom the Colombo area were testedfor anti- bodies against seven arboviruses of thefamilies Togaviridae and Bunyaviridae by aplaque- reduction neutralization microtest, using Vero cells anda stable line ofpig kidney (PS) cells. The overallpercentages ofpositive sera among the mammals were: Bhanja, 92.5 o; Calovo (Batai), 30.6%; Sindbis, 13.8%; Langat, 4.8%; Tahyna, 3.9%o; West Nile, 1.6%. Among the birds, 23.8% had antibodies to Bhanja virus and9.5% to Sindbis. No antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus werefound. The results show that at least two members of the Bunyaviridae family (Bhanja and Calovo) are highly endemic in Colombo. In many countries of the tropical and subtropical climatic zone, arbovirus infections appear frequently and, under certain circumstances, can cause a serious public health problem. Information about the occur- rence of arboviruses in a particular country may be obtained quickly and conveniently by serological assays of human and/or animal blood samples. In this study, we examined sera from animals in Sri Lanka for the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against some arboviruses. Previous research on arbo- virus infections in Sri Lanka has been limited mostly to dengue and Chikungunya epidemics (1-3). MATERIALS AND METHODS Serum samples were collected from 49 cattle and 57 goats in the abattoir of Colombo. These animals came from Colombo and the surrounding area. In addi- tion, serum samples were taken from 29 dogs from the area, and 21 crows (Corvus spp.) captured with the use of chloralose. The sera were inactivated at 56 °C for 30 minutes, diluted, and examined for the pres- ence of antibodies against seven arboviruses. Viruses The virus strains used in the tests were: 1. Sindbis virus, strain Eg Ar 339, passaged 15 times in suckling mice;a ' Institute of Parasitology, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czechoslovakia. 2 Institute of Hygiene, University of Graz, Graz, Austria.

Casals, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. 2. West Nile virus, strain Eg 110, passaged 13 times in suckling mice;, 3. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, strain Hypr (4), passaged 55 times in HeLa cells and 11 times in juvenile mice; 4. Langat virus, strain TP 21 (5); 5. Tahyna virus, strain P6b, passaged 7 times in suckling mice (6); 6. Calovo virus, strain 184, passaged 7 times in suckling mice (7); 7. Bhanja virus, strain 326, passaged 5 times in suckling mice (8). Cell lines Vero cells were used for the assay with all viruses except Langat, for which PS (stable pig kidney) cells were used. Both cell lines were grown in Eagle's mini- mum essential medium supplemented with lact- albumin hydrolysate (1 g/litre), sodium bicarbonate (1.1 g/litre), calf serum (100 ml/litre for Vero cells, 50 ml/litre for PS cells), and antibiotics. Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) The procedure for the PRNT was basically that of de Madrid & Porterfield (9) modified for microplates (10). However, the unit volume of virus and diluted serum was 25 id instead of 40 gl, and the virus test doses were adjusted so that they caused almost con- fluent plaques (90-95% cytolysis). The serum samples were incubated with the virus test doses on microplates at 4 °C for 18 hours; the cells were then added and the plates incubated at 36 °C for 4 hours before the addition of carboxymethylcellulose over- lay. The incubation medium was Leibovitz L15 with 307 fetal calf serum. The final incubation period was 3 days for Tahyna, 4 days for Calovo, 5 days for Sindbis, West Nile and Bhanja, and 6 days for tick- 4364 -987- V. BARDOS ET AL. borne encephalitis and Langat viruses. Control im- mune sera against Sindbis, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, Tahyna, and Calovo viruses were pre- pared at the Institute of Sera and Vaccines (IMUNA, 08222 Sari§ske Michalany, Czechoslovakia); the Bhanja antiserum was prepared as described pre- viously (8). The dilution of serum that caused an 80-100%o reduction in cytolysis of the virus test dose was regarded as the serum titre. RESULTS The proportions of sera giving a positive reaction against the various arboviruses are shown in Table 1. In domestic animals, the frequency of antibodies was highest against Bhanja virus (97.9% of cattle, and 91.2% of goats) and Calovo virus (77.1% of cattle and 1.7% of goats); there was a low prevalence of antibodies against Tahyna, West Nile, and Langat viruses, while antibodies against tick-borne enceph- alitis were not detected. In dogs, the highest frequency of antibodies was found against Bhanja (86.2%); no antibodies were detected against West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, Langat and Tahyna viruses. Crows revealed antibodies against Bhanja and Sindbis viruses (23.8% and 9.5%, respectively) but not against the other viruses tested. Table 2 shows titres of randomly selected positive sera against Calovo and Bhanja viruses. The distri- bution of the antibody titres indicates the recent circulation of these viruses in Sri Lanka. DISCUSSION The serological assays on free-grazing animals yielded information about the incidence of various arboviruses in the examined areas. Because neutraliz- ing antibodies persist in the infected animals longer than haemagglutination-inhibiting or complement- Table 1.

The PRNT is an especially appealing technique since it is not only very sensitive, but also markedly specific. In the PRNT, Vero cells were used for most of the viruses tested, because these cells are easy to maintain even under the carboxymethyl- cellulose overlay. A disadvantage of Vero cells is that flaviviruses of the tick-borne encephalitis subgroup, unadjusted to cell cultures, either do not form plaques, or do so only after 9-15 days (11). In these cases, the use of PS cells (which are, however, less easy to maintain) is the method of choice. The micro- method of PRNT, used in this survey, is a little less sensitive than the macromethod (9), but is more econ- omical in that only one quarter the amount of each reagent is needed. We did not detect antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus, but sera of three goats contained antibodies against Langat, a closely related virus which was isolated originally from Ixodes granulatus ticks in Malaysia (12) and which obviously occurs also in Sri Lanka (assuming that the goats were not imported). The discovery of antibodies against Calovo virus is not surprising because this virus is considered to be a strain of Batai virus (13), which was isolated in Malaysia. Calovo virus has been found in other Asian countries, including India (14) where the most fre- quent vector of the virus is Anopheles stephensi (15). Calovo and Batai viruses have not yet been found to cause symptomatic infections in animals or man, and specific antibodies in man have been detected only sporadically. The circulation of Tahyna virus in Sri Lanka remains questionable. The reduction of plaques in the five positive animal sera was incomplete, and several plaques always persisted, although the titres were 1:40 to 1:640. It is therefore likely that another virus of the California serogroup, with antigenic composition similar to that of Tahyna virus, might occur in Sri Lanka. Bhanja virus antibodies were detected in Sri Lanka for the first time, and in a remarkably high propor- tion, especially among domestic animals. The virus was originally isolated from Haemaphysalis inter- media ticks in India (16), where a high prevalence of antibodies among goats was also found. The occur- rence of antibodies against Bhanja virus in dogs and crows has not previously been reported. Bhanja virus may cause laboratory and natural infections in man (17, 18) and the antibodies have been found in the human population of various countries of Africa, Asia, and Europe (16, 19-21). It has been found that owners of goats and sheep have a higher frequency of antibodies than other inhabitants of the same area (22). The postulated association of Bhanja virus with a paralytic disease in sheep and goats remains un- confirmed, because experimental infections have not demonstrated any significant susceptibility of these animals to the virus (23-25). In a previous study (3), antibodies were detected against Chikungunya, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Tahyna viruses among animals and man in Sri Lanka. The present study has not covered all arbo- viruses in Sri Lanka but it has shown that natural foci of at least two bunyavirus (Bhanja and Calovo/Batai) infections exist in the country. Moreover, the circu- lation of Sindbis and Langat togaviruses and of a possible Tahyna-like bunyavirus has also been demonstrated. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Our thanks are due to Dr J. Casals, Dr H. Libikova and Dr V. Mayer for the supply of virus strains.

In Tunisia, West Nile Fever (WNF) outbreaks were reported in humans in 1997, 2003 and 2012. Usutu Virus (USUV), which is a ‘new’ emerging Flavivirus antigenically close to WNV, has never been reported in Tunisia. A serological investigation in 284 equids was conducted in 2012 in the southern west region of the country to assess the presence and prevalence of the WNV and USUV infec- tion. Of the 284 samples tested by competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay, 129 were positive. Of these, 120 (42.3%) had WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence was significantly higher in areas closer to the oasis compared with that of the surrounding arid areas. Antibody titres against USUV were also reported in 10 equids. This was the first evidence of USUV circulation in Tunisia. Data recorded by this study indicate that WNV and USUV have circulated/are circulating in the region and that there is an urgent need to adapt the current sur- veillance programmes to this new scenario. Introduction West Nile (WNV) and Usutu (USUV) viruses are mos- quito-borne, mainly bird-associated flaviviruses and mem- bers of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) complex (Heinz et al., 2000). In the last fifteen years, WNV has dra- matically expanded its geographic range and is now consid- ered the most widespread arbovirus in the world (Lanciotti et al., 2000; Gould et al., 2003; Bontemps et al., 2009). Usutu Virus is antigenically closely related to WNV (Kuno et al., 1998; Bakonyi et al., 2004). Previously restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, USUV emerged in Central Europe for the first time in 1996 in the provinces of Florence and Pistoia (Tuscany region), in Central Italy (Weissenb€ock et al., 2013). Several bird species were affected, and most of the bird carcasses found were Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula). Five years later, in late summer 2001, similar sea- sonal deaths of wild birds (again predominantly blackbirds) were observed in Austria (Weissenb€ock et al., 2002). Usutu Virus continued its spread across Europe, expand- ing from its original location into south-east (Hungary), south (Italy), west (Switzerland), and north (Czech Republic, Poland), causing mainly disease and mortality in birds (Hubalek, 2008; Meister et al., 2008; Manarolla et al., 2010). The disease was characterized in birds by encephalitis, myocardial degeneration and necrosis in liver and spleen (Chavala et al., 2004). In 2009, USUV was shown to exhibit human pathogenicity when it was for the first time associated to neuroinvasive infection in two immune-compromised patients in Italy (Cavrini et al., 2009; Pecorari et al., 2009). As well as other arb- oviruses (vector-borne viruses), USUV and WNV exploit complex biotic and trophic interactions between vectors and reservoirs to persist in a particular area. These inter- actions are influenced by numerous ecological and envi- ronmental factors that may confer unique characteristics © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Transboundary and Emerging Diseases. 61 (2014) 385–389 385 Transboundary and Emerging Diseases to the virus cycle in a particular ecosystem, including dif- ferential ways of transmission and permanence (Calzolari et al., 2013). Along with humans, horses are other possi- ble accidental hosts for WNV. But, they are unable to generate a level of viraemia high enough to infect new mosquitoes. Hence, they are considered ‘dead-end’ hosts (Ziegler et al., 2013). For USUV infection, horses do not show also a strong immune response (not induce high antibody titres) (Savini et al., 2011). However, the detec- tion of a seroconversion in sentinel equines may be a useful tool in the epidemiological monitoring of WNV and USUV (Savini et al., 2011; Bocanegra et al., 2012). In Tunisia, WNV contingency plan is based on passive surveillance of human, bird and equine cases. Human out- breaks due to WNV lineage I were observed in 1997, 2003 and 2012 (ONMNE, 2012). In the outbreak occurred between July and December 2012, 98 WNF human cases were confirmed, including 86 neuroinvasive cases (ON- MNE, 2012). The major number of cases were reported in three southern governorates of the country, Gabes (n = 20), K�ebili (n = 13) and Medenine (n = 3), territories characterized by arid areas where plant growth is scarce except in the oasis zones (humid areas). The objective of this study was to assess the presence and distribution of WNV and USUV seropositivity in equids in the governorate of K�ebili. Materials and Methods Samples The study was carried out in 2012 in the governorate of K�ebili, located in south-western Tunisia (Fig. 1). Blood samples were collected from 284 equids randomly selected (28 horses, 37 mules and 219 donkeys). For each sampled animal, an accompanying form with information on the farm (name of veterinarian and owner, location) as well as on the animal (breed, age, sex, vaccination, origin, move- ments and clinical signs) was filled. Samples were centri- fuged and dispatched on ice at 4°C to ‘the Institut de Recherche V�et�erinaire de Tunisie (IRVT)’ for analysis. A commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay (c-ELISA) kit (IDVet�, Montpellier, France) was used to screen the serum samples for the presence of WNV antibodies, following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Alonso-Padilla et al., 2010). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), a technique more specific than the c-ELISA, was used on positive sam- ples to discriminate positivity due to USUV from that due to WNV antibodies. The test was conducted at the Istituto Zooprofalitico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ‘G. Caporale’ (IZSAM), OIE reference laboratory for WND, under biosafety level 3 conditions as described (OIE, 2012). The WNV E-101 and SAAR 1776 strains were used as refer- ence. The titre was determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with a 90% reduction of the number of plaques (PRNT90). Sera with a titre ≥10 were considered positive. Statistical analysis Results obtained in this study were estimated and com- pared using a Bayesian approach (Sivia, 1996). The upper (UCL) and lower (LCL) 95% confidence levels [limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI)] were calculated using a beta probability distribution (Vose, 2000). Calculations were performed using MS-Excel� for Windows�, version 2010 (MS Excel 2010). A logistic regression between the outcome of the event (i.e. seropositivity) and the selected variables was performed using EpiInfo 6.04d (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention CDC, 2001). The variables considered were sex, species, stable (whether or not ani- mals were kept in a stable), age (numeric value; D = 5 years) and distance from oasis (continuous vari- ables, D = 0.2 km). For sex, equine species and stable, the reference class considered was the category supposed to be more susceptible for WNV infection. The origin and movements of animals were not included in the model because many regression classes would have been empty. Fig. 1.

Ben Hassine et al. Given that most of equines are near the oasis, 80% within a distance <2 km, the distance of 0.2 km was chosen to equilibrate the class. Results The age of the selected animals ranged from 2 to 18 years, with an average of 6.8 years. All sampled ani- mals were not vaccinated and did not show clinical signs of neurological disorders at the time of sampling. Of the 284 samples tested, 129 were WNV c-ELISA-reactive (45.4%; 95% CI 39.7–51.2%). Of 129 WNV-reactive sam- ples, 120 samples (42.3%; 95% CI 36.6–48.1%) neutral- ized WNV antibodies and were PRNT90 positive with antibody titres ranging between 1 : 10 and 1 : 80. Of 129 WNV c-ELISA-reactive samples, 10 sera (3.5%; CI 1.9– 6.4%) neutralized USUV; among which, 8 sera had anti- body titres ranging between 1 : 10 and 1 : 20 for USUV and high antibody titres ranging from 1 : 40 to 1 : 80 for WNV. The 2 other sera showed antibody titres ranging from 1 : 40 to 1 : 80 for USUV and very low titres against WNV ranging between 1 : 10 and 1 : 16. Serum neutralizing antibodies for WNV were present in 4 horses (14.3%; 95% CI 10.2–18.4%), 4 mules (10.8%; 95% CI 7.1–14.5%) and in 112 donkeys tested (51.1%; 95% CI 45.1–57.1%). The presence of serum neutralizing antibod- ies for USUV was recorded in9 donkeys and 1 horse. No significant association was observed between sex, species and the seropositivity for both WNV and USUV. Logistic regression confirmed that seropositivity risk for WNV infection increased with the age of animals, a difference of 5 years corresponding to a change of seropositivity odds by a factor of 1.32. Stabling horses could be consid- ered a protective factor (P-value: 0.038). According to the logistic model, the geographic location (i.e. the distance from oasis) was the only variable which significantly (P- value: 0.007) influenced the WNV seropositivity in equines (Table 1). For equines, the risk of being WNV seropositive increased (56%) with each 0.2 km decrease of distance from the nearest oasis. Discussion This study confirmed the presence of both WNV and USUV neutralizing antibodies in equids in the south of Tunisia. The WNV seroprevalence value found in this study (42.3%) was in line with that reported in a previ- ous study in K�ebili governorate (about 58.2%; Bergaoui et al., 2013). The increase in seroprevalence rate accord- ing to the equine age suggests recurrent circulation of WNV over time, as described in some serosurveys per- formed in endemic areas both in horses and in humans (Cohen et al., 1999; Chevalier et al., 2006). In our study, equids kept outside (without stabling and therefore at risk of exposure to a greater number of infective mosqui- toes’ bites) had a significantly increased risk of being seropositive compared with those kept inside stable. This result may suggest that vector is rather exophilous (i.e. not entering buildings), as Culex species does. Geographic location (i.e. distance from the oases) was the variable, which significantly influenced the WNV seropositivity in equids in this study. In particular, the risk of being WNV seropositive increases with the decrease of distance from the nearest wetland area (oasis). The oasis is an area with lush vegetation and high soil moisture. The combination of reduced radiation due to the shading and the evapora- tion cooling effect reduces the temperature, which is gen- erally lower compared with the surrounding arid area (Potchter et al., 2008). This small rich habitat may be attractive for both resident and migrant birds (Rodri- guez-Estrella, 2005). Droughts and heat waves were found to induce WNV amplification by bringing the hosts and the vectors together. WNF cases have been regularly reported in subdesertic areas around the Mediterranean basin: (i) along the Nile Valley (Egypt, 1950; 1994) (ii) along the Syrian-African Rift (Israel, 1951, 1998–2000; Jordan, 2003); (iii) in the Timimoun oasis in the central Sahara (Algeria, 1994) (Taylor et al., 1956; Murgue et al., 2001). The warmer conditions of these areas may have direct effects on vectors and hosts, the standing water (rich in organic materials) attracts mosquitoes and birds and, consequently, the interaction and circulation of WNV among them is increased (Epstein and Defilippo, 2001). Further studies are needed to better understand the relation between the epidemiology of WNV and the ecology of an infected area having an ‘oasis effect’. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that anti- USUV neutralizing antibody titres are reported in equids in Tunisia. Ten USUV seropositive equines of 284 tested (seroprevalence 3.5%) were recorded. Because only WNV c-ELISA-reactive samples were tested for USUV, it is possi- Table 1.

Ben Hassine et al. West Nile and Usutu Viruses in Equids in Tunisia ble that seroprevalence could be actually higher. On the other side, it is well known that flaviviruses may present a high degree of serological cross-reactivity, sometimes even in the neutralization test at low titres, given their close anti- genic relationships (Calisher et al., 1989; Niedrig et al., 2007). PRNT is regarded a standard test in Flavivirus serol- ogy (Calisher et al., 1989). So, we cannot exclude a possible cross-reaction for the sera presenting low titres for USUV (n = 8). Other explanation for the low titres recorded for USUV antibodies is that the animals may have been infected long time before the sampling. Moreover, horses are not susceptible to USUV and do not develop a strong immune response or high antibody titres (Savini et al., 2011). The presence of high antibody titre to USUV in 2 sera (4-fold to 8-fold higher than the titres to WNV) indi- cates a recent infection with USUV. A co-infection with WNV and USUV is possible. Probably, the two viruses share the same vector, Culex pipiens. In literature, USUV and WNV seem to have similar cycles (Calzolari et al., 2011). A possible involvement of other mammals and other vectors like Aedes Albopictus in USUV epidemiology is reported (Tamba et al., 2010). Co-circulation of both viruses is not uncommon. It has been reported in equines (Lupulovic et al., 2011; Barbi�c et al., 2013), in birds (Weissenb€ock et al., 2002) and sentinel chickens (Lelli et al., 2008). Usutu Virus has been recently associated with cases of encephalitis in humans indicating that, similar to other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) complex, it is also able to invade the central nervous system with the potential to become a new public health threat (Cavrini et al., 2009; Pecorari et al., 2009; Tamba et al., 2010; Calzolari et al., 2011). These findings suggest that the passive surveillance plan currently in operation in Tunisia should be reinforced with active surveillance on sentinel animals, and possibly extended to the monitoring of other flaviviruses, covering other areas. The use of more specifics tests to discriminate the possible cross-reaction between circulating flaviviruses is recommended. Future investiga- tions should couple serological and virological detection approaches to isolate the flaviviruses strains circulating in the region and to determine their geographical origin. Conclusion In conclusion, this study confirmed the existence of a co-circulation of USUV and WNV in the south-west of Tunisia. Both viruses seem to be able to cause neurological diseases in humans in particular conditions. Hence, it is important that the current WNV surveillance plan in Tuni- sia considers other Flaviviruses, such as USUV. The exten- sion of surveillance to other Flaviviruses would require new diagnostic and more specific procedures able to process large number of samples in a limited period of time. It would be also interesting to continue monitoring equine to obtain information on the timing effect of oasis on WN and Usutu viruses following determination of its origin.

However, its status as a self-perpetu- ating pathogen in South America remains uncertain. Infected horses and birds have been reported in vari- ous Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and northern Central America (2,3). In South America, isolated reports of infected dead-end hosts (horses) have come from northern Colombia and Argentina, but they lack evidence for infection in avian amplifying hosts (4,5). We report serologic evidence of establishment of WNV in South America. Serum samples from birds and horses from 33 locations in Venezuela (Online Appendix Table, available from http://www.cdc.gov/ EID/content/13/4/651-appT.htm) were screened for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against WNV anti- gen by ELISA (6) and confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as previously described (7). The flavivirus generating the IgG response was identified by using the following criteria: 90% inhibition of virus in serum diluted at least 1:40 and 4-fold greater neutralizing anti- body titer compared with closely related flaviviruses. IgG antibody against flavivirus was detected by ELISA in 14 of 576 resident birds, including 5 Turdus leucomelas, 3 Gallus gallus (captive), 2 Campylor- hamphus trochilirostris, and 1 each of Elaenia flavogaster, Coereba flaveo- la, Thraupis palmarum, and Anisog- nathus flavinucha. WNV was confirmed as the etio- logic agent of infection in 5 adult birds (3 T. leucomelas [pale-breasted thrush], 1 C. flaveola [bananaquit], and 1 G. gallus [domestic chicken] with the earliest collection date in February 2006); virus neutralization Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 4, April 2007 651 Figure. Temperature and heart rate relationship: scatter plot for patients with dengue fever and nondengue febrile illnesses. LETTERS titers ranged from 80 to 320. One serum sample cross-reacted with other flaviviruses tested, with equiva- lent titers to WNV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and Ilheus virus (ILHV) and was thus considered infected with an undetermined fla- vivirus. Seven serum samples were negative (antibody titers <20), and 1 sample was not tested because of insufficient sample volume. Antibody against flavivirus was detected by ELISA in 141 of 791 hors- es, and 34 (4.3%) were confirmed pos- itive for WNV infection by PRNT; viral titers ≥640 occurred in half of these horses. The earliest collection date for a WNV-positive horse was February 2004 and the most recent was May 2006. Specific WNV-reac- tive equine serum samples were dis- tributed in valley regions (prevalence 1.3%), savannah grasslands (2.4%), the western region of Zulia (0.4%) and the Central Lake Basin (0.3%). A total of 46 (5.8%) equine serum samples were positive for neutralizing antibody to SLEV, and 8 (1.0%) samples were positive for neutralizing antibodies to ILHV. Forty-nine samples neutralized at least 2 of the 3 viruses and were classified as undetermined flavivirus- es. Serum samples from 2 horses were negative in neutralization assays; 2 others were not tested because of insufficient sample volume. Detection of WNV-infected resi- dent birds provides strong evidence of the establishment, rather than impor- tation, of WNV in South America. We hypothesize that ornithophilic mos- quitoes (such as some Culex spp.), which are present in the area in con- sistently high numbers, acquired the virus through hematophagous feeding on recently infected, migrating birds. Once introduced to local mosquitoes, virus is amplified among susceptible resident birds fed upon by ornitho- philic mosquitoes. This pattern allows perpetuation and subsequent estab- lishment of virus in a continuous transmission cycle, as opposed to infection of dead-end hosts, e.g., hors- es. This is the first report of WNV infection in South American birds and definitive establishment of the virus in South America. We observed varying WNV sero- prevalence rates in birds and horses across regions in Venezuela (Figure). These differences reflect the focal and stochastic nature of arbovirus trans- mission, which depends upon many ecologic factors. One possible expla- nation for the greater seroprevalence in the central and eastern llanos (savannahs) and valley regions, com- pared with the coastal western region of Zulia State (p<0.0001, by Pearson’s χ2 test) would be virus introduction by migrating birds by an eastern migration route. Existence of several closely relat- ed flaviviruses in the American trop- ics (8–10) may convey cross-protec- tion in animals (e.g., ILHV and SLEV) or humans (dengue viruses, yellow fever virus), thereby potential- ly diminishing disease caused by a newly introduced flavivirus such as WNV. Although ILHV infection has not been detected in Venezuela, this flavivirus is prevalent in Brazil, Peru, French Guyana, Trinidad, and Colombia. Our study demonstrated widespread distribution of ILHV in Venezuela. Other South American fla- viviruses, such as Bussuquara, Cacipacore, and Iguape, and as yet undiscovered viruses may also circu- late in Venezuela. We encourage those involved in the public and animal health systems in Venezuela to consider zoonotic fla- viviruses in the differential diagnoses of human and equine cases of encephalitis and to consider ecologic surveillance for zoonotic flaviviruses in mosquito and vertebrate host popu- lations. We recommend monitoring blood and organ donations for fla- vivirus infections. Our study sheds light on flavivirus distribution in Venezuela. However, nothing else is known about the ecology of zoonotic flaviviruses in this country. Such knowledge will be essential for designing effective surveillance and control should these viruses be shown to cause human illnesses. 652 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 4, April 2007 Figure.

The patient had returned the day before from a 1- month stay in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where he spent most of his time in close contact with young children from an orphanage, most of whom had diarrhea. Clinical examination at admission showed fever (39°C), chills, diffuse abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting. The patient received ceftriaxone, which was stopped on day 4 because initial blood and stool cultures were negative for pathogens and clinical signs had com- pletely resolved. Ten days later, he reported the recurrence of diarrhea without fever. A novel stool culture grew Shigella sonnei. An extended-spectrum β-lac- tamase (ESBL) was detected by dou- ble-disk synergy test; the isolate was also resistant to aminoglycosides (except amikacin), tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole. The strain was suscep- tible to fluoroquinolones and fos- fomycin. It also appeared susceptible to azithromycin (MIC 4 µg/mL), although azithromycin MIC for Shigella spp. should be interpreted with caution (1). The patient was suc- cessfully treated with azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg/day for 5 days. Azithromycin was preferred to fluoro- quinolones to avoid the risk for tendinopathy because of the patient’s history of chronic juvenile arthritis and because this antimicrobial agent was shown to be effective in the treat- ment of shigellosis caused by mul- tidrug-resistant strains (2).

Meeks, Juan P. Carrera, Ryan M. Duplechin, Roger Hewson, Asankadyr T. Junushov, Olga N. Gavrilova, Irena Breininger, Carleton J. Phillips, Robert J. Baker, and John Hay Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an emerging pathogen in Europe and Asia. We investigated TBEV in Kyrgyzstan by collecting small mammals and ticks from diverse localities and analyzing them for evidence of TBEV infection. We found TBEV circulating in Kyrgyzstan much farther south and at higher altitudes than previously reported. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a fl avivirus in the family Flaviviridae. The TBEV positive-sense RNA genome is translated as a polyprotein and subsequently cleaved into 3 structural and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins (1). TBEV has 3 subtypes— European, Siberian, and Far-Eastern—each of which has its own ecology, clinical presentation, and geographic distribution (2). The vectors are Ixodes ricinus ticks for the European subtype and I. persulcatus ticks for the other 2 subtypes. TBEV circulates through a complex cycle involving small mammals, ticks, and large mammals (3); it can also be transmitted through consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products (4). Our unpublished data and that of others suggest that TBEV circulates in Kazakhstan. However, we have found no reports (in English) since 1978 of TBEV infection in the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan). Kyrgyzstan has extensive alpine and subalpine habitats (94% of Kyrgyzstan is >1,000 m above sea level) (5); the Tien Shan mountain range dominates and physiographically links Kyrgyzstan to the Himalayas and western People’s Republic of China. We conducted fi eldwork in Kyrgyzstan during June–July 2007 and July–August 2009 to establish a baseline of risk for zoonotic diseases, including TBEV. The Study During the 2007 and 2009 study periods, we collected 369 rodents and insectivores and 222 ixodid and 128 argasid ticks from 6 localities in Kyrgyzstan (Figure 1; Table 1) in accordance with animal subject review boards of Texas Tech University and the State University of New York at Buffalo. We analyzed 302 rodents and insectivores for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM to TBEV by using recombinant antigen of domain III from the envelope (E) protein of Kumlinge and Powassan viruses (6). This assay is specifi c for the tick-borne fl avivirus group and lacks cross-reactivity that occurs with other assays (7). We found that serologically positive (IgG and IgM) mammals were clustered at Ala-Archa National Nature Park, ≈40 km south of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, at elevations ranging from 1,891 to 2,472 m. Using mitochondrial DNA analysis, we also found clusters of seropositive Himalayan fi eld mice, Apodemus pallipes. To further evaluate the prevalence of TBEV, we used reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) to examine viral genomic sequences in tissue samples collected from rodents, insectivores, and ticks. We used 3 separate PCR protocols. Table 2 shows primer sequences. Real-time and conventional RT-PCRs were used; however, conventional RT-PCR was preferred because it allowed sequencing of viral genomes. Thus far, we have examined sequences from the NS5 (8) and E (9) protein coding regions. On the basis of data obtained in 2007, we focused collections in 2009 at 2 sites at Ala-Archa, 5 km apart and differing in elevation by 100 m. We found TBEV- positive ticks and IgG- and IgM-positive A. pallipes mice at collection sites. Sequence analyses of TBEV NS5 and E genes from A. pallipes mice and I. persulcatus ticks suggested that the TBEV circulating in Kyrgyzstan is DISPATCHES 876 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 17, No. 5, May 2011 Author affi liations: State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA (B.J.

Animal trapping sites in Kyrgyzstan, with topographic characteristics shown. Ala-Archa (star) is the location of tick- borne encephalitis virus and a possible human case of tick-borne encephalitis. Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus, Kyrgyzstan of the Siberian subtype. Phylogenetic analyses of the E protein, amplifi ed from a pool of I. persulcatus ticks collected at Ala-Archa, showed that the TBEV strain from Kyrgyzstan shares a clade with 2 strains (TBEV 1467 and Z6) isolated in the Novosibirsk region of Russia (Figure 2). This sequence is homologous with that of 5 other TBEV- positive tick pools and liver samples from A. pallipes mice from the same collection site. While we were conducting fi eldwork in 2009, a possible case of encephalitis occurred in a human. The 21-year-old man had removed an engorged tick (I. persulcatus) from himself after visiting Ala-Archa in June 2009. After ≈22 days, he sought care at the National Center for Infection in Bishkek for signs and symptoms consistent with viral encephalitis; he died 15 days later. We obtained 2 samples of the patient’s serum (in accordance with approved human Institutional Review Board protocols from the State University of New York at Buffalo) at 22 and 37 days postexposure. The TBEV IgG titer for the 22-day sample was 200, within reference range, but the titer at 37 days was 2,000. This rising titer strongly indicates infection with TBEV. Conclusions Identifi cation of the Ala-Archa National Nature Park as a focus of TBEV transmission is noteworthy because of its proximity to the capital. This TBEV focus is unlikely to be transient because we found evidence of TBEV in small mammals and ticks in 2007 and in 2009. We also found serologic evidence of human infection in 2009. Our fi ndings are relevant to public health because Ala-Archa is frequently visited by hikers and climbers from many parts of the world. In 2008, nearly 45,000 persons visited Ala-Archa. A TBEV focus at 2,100 m on the north slope of the Tien Shan mountains is relevant for several reasons. One of these is the fact that the east–west Tien Shan mountain range marks the approximate southernmost distribution of I. persulcatus ticks, the vectors of the Siberian and Far- Eastern strains of TBEV (10). Likewise, the north slope of this mountain range marks the northernmost distribution of the likely reservoir species in Kyrgyzstan, A. pallipes mice. Our analysis of cytochrome b DNA sequences from these mice in Kyrgyzstan supports the hypothesis that they are recent, Late Pleistocene or Holocene epoch (<15,000 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 17, No. 5, May 2011 877 Table 1.

A tentative explanation for the TBEV focus on the northern slope at Ala-Archa is that this slope is the approximate geographic point of overlap for the distribution of I. persulcatus ticks and a suitable reservoir species, A. pallipes mice. Although A. pallipes mice have not previously been identifi ed as a TBEV reservoir, other Apodemus spp. mice in Europe and Siberia are TBEV reservoirs. Laboratory studies have shown that, in contrast with other rodents, mice of the genus Apodemus are capable of vertical transmission (11) and nonviremic transmission of TBEV through ixodid ticks (12). Finding TBEV-infected ticks active at these altitudes is probably not the result of climate change. Rather, we propose altitude compensation at southern latitudes as an explanation. By altitude compensation, we mean that the closer one gets to the equator, the higher the altitude that is needed for ideal transmission ecology. We suggest that TBEV transmission in Kyrgyzstan is a delicate interaction between tick larvae, tick nymphs, and reservoir rodents, analogous to the situation seen with I. ricinus ticks in central Europe (13). Our fi ndings provide testable hypotheses about the ecologic and physiographic factors that determine the distribution of TBEV in Kyrgyzstan. Additional understanding of these factors will aid public health responses to the zoonosis caused by this virus (14).

This represents the first isolation of SLE virus from a marine mammal. The animal presented with reduced appetite, rapidly became lethar- gic and subsequently died. Virus-induced CPE was observed in a dolphin cell line, SP-1K (ATCC CCL 78), inoculated with brain, kidney, and lung tissues obtained at necropsy. Electron microscopy of infected SP-1 K cells revealed the presence of virions having morphology and size resembling members of the Flaviviridae. Final identifi- cation as SLE virus was made by neutralization and immunofluorescence staining tests. Key words: Flavivirus; Orcinus orca; Encephalitis; Marine mammal Introduction Case Report A mature male killer whale (Orcinus orca), estimated to be 25 or more years old, presented with reduced appetite. Within 24 h, the animal became lethargic. The animal died in September, 1990, within 48 h after the onset of clinical signs, while under veterinary care. The necropsy was unremarkable, but the histopathology examination reported a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. Laboratory Studies Virus isolation. Frozen samples of brain, lung, kidney and several other organs were sent to the ATCC Virology Laboratory as part of an ongoing screen for viruses of cetaceans. All tissues were thawed, mixed with sterile sand and tissue culture medium, and aseptically ground with a mortar and pestle. The suspensions were clarified by low-speed centrifugation (500 x g for 10 min) and the supernatants were used to Correspondence to."" C. Buck, Virology Department, ATCC, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. 110 inoculate primary African Green Monkey kidney cells, SP-1K (a dolphin cell line, ATCC CCL 78) cells and bovine turbinate (ATCC CRL 1390) cells. Upon initial inoculation, bacterial contaminations were noted in all cultures. All first passage cultures were frozen, thawed and blind passaged on fresh cells in the presence of 100 #g/ml gentamycin sulfate. Possible CPE was noted in SP-1K cells inoculated with the brain, kidney and lung samples. These samples were passed through a 0.2-#m filter and a third passage was made on SP-1K cells. A definitive CPE was then observed from the brain, lung and kidney samples; cells became rounded and refractile and detached from the flask. No further attempts were made to isolate the agent from the bovine turbinate and primary monkey kidney cells. The bacterial contaminants, although not identified, do not at this time appear related to the animal's death. Many of the necropsy samples received by ATCC for viral screening from cetaceans have bacterial or fungal contaminants. This is due in part to the cetacean's large size and insulating layer of blubber which make it impossible to quickly cool the animal after death. As a result, bacteria from the intestine and other non-sterile areas quickly multiply and spread throughout the peritoneal cavity. Electron microscopy. When infected SP-1K cells showed distinct CPE, they were removed from the flask and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for two hours. Fixed cell suspensions were sent to the VA Virology Laboratory in West Haven, Connecticut by overnight mail. The cells were postfixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr's resin as described previously (Hsiung, 1982). Thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1). For each of the three (brain, lung and kidney) SP-1K samples, numerous enveloped virus particles 40-50 nm in size were seen in the cytoplasm. Each particle had an electron-dense core 25 nm in diameter; virus particles budding from the plasma membrane were also observed (Fig. 1, inset). With the noted size and morphology, the isolate was tentatively identified as a member of the Flaviviridae family. Final identification. A virus preparation propagated from the brain sample, having a titer of 104.5 tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDso) was inactivated by exposure to 20% chloroform for two hours. A neutralization test on the same virus preparation was performed in SP-1K cells. Antisera to Japanese encephalitis virus (ATCC VR- 1259AF) suppressed the appearance of CPE for 72 h, but CPE subsequently devel- oped. In contrast, antisera to St. Louis encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-1265AF) com- pletely neutralized the infectious virus through the entire 7 days incubation. In addition, acetone-fixed infected and non-infected SP-1K cells were sent to Dr. Karabatsos at the CDC Arbovirus Diseases Branch of the Division for Vector-Borne Infectious Disease, CDC in Fort Collins, CO, for confirmation. Using monoclonal SLE type-specific antibody (Roehrig et al., 1983), the three isolates were identified as St. Louis encephalitis virus by the immunofluorescent staining test (Nick Karabatsos, personal communication). It should be noted that, although two strains of SLE are available through the ATCC, neither has been propagated at the ATCC during the past four years that the marine mammal screening program has been active. Consequently, it is very unlikely that the three SLE isolates, from a single animal, were the result of cross-contamination from existing stocks. 111 Fig. I.

Discussion We have been unable to find any reference to SLE virus infecting marine mammals in the current literature (McLean and Bowen, 1980; Buck and Schroeder, 1990; Kennedy-Stospkopf, 1990; Monath, 1990). Since 1933, when the SLE virus was first isolated from a human brain, there have been many recognized epidemics of St. Louis encephalitis in the United States. The clinical cases associated with these outbreaks, and the intervening endemic periods, have been most frequent in California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana (Monath, 1990). SLE is a member of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) antigenic subgroup of the Flaviviridae (Wengler, 1991). Wild birds appear to be the primary (maintaining) vertebrate host, and the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from infected viremic birds to susceptible birds. When conditions are suitable (large numbers of viremic birds and large numbers of mosquitoes), transmission to incidental hosts such as humans and horses occurs. Although several members of the JE subgroup are 112 pathogenic for humans, only the prototype JE strain is economically important as a disease of domestic animals (Fenner, 1987). SLE virus does not cause clinical disease in horses and other domestic mammals (Monath, 1990). Even in humans where SLE can cause severe encephalitis, many cases of SLE go undiagnosed or are subclinical (Monath, 1990). In the present case, the killer whale apparently contracted SLE virus during a recognized SLE outbreak in Florida (CDC, 1990a,b). It is likely that, as with humans, killer whales are incidental hosts in the SLE cycle. Other cetaceans in the vicinity of the infected animal showed no illness consistent with SLE and were seronegative for SLE antibody (data not presented). The absence of reports associating illness or death of any marine mammal with SLE or other member of the Japanese encephalitis group further suggests that infections of marine mammals by infected mosquitoes are quite rare or, as in the case of many terrestrial mammals, most SLE infections are subclinical. This report of an unexpected isolation of St. Louis Encephalitis virus from a cetacean demonstrates the importance of viral screening in animal species where the knowledge of viral pathogens is limited. The EM examination provided a rapid presumptive identification of an unknown agent which was confirmed by antibody neutralization and immunofluorescent staining tests. Studies are currently under way to identify two additional agents recently isolated in cell culture from other marine mammal specimens.

Usutu virus, another flavivirus, came to prominence in 2001, when it was identified as the agent responsible for a drop in the bird population in Austria; previously this encephalitic virus was found only in birds and mosquitoes in Africa. Sindbis virus, a pathogenic alphavirus that causes arthritis, is widespread throughout Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia, infecting a range of arthropods and vertebrates and is genetically related to encephalitic viruses in North America. Currently there is no evidence that any of these viruses cause disease in the UK. Here the presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies is reported in the sera of resident and migrant birds in the UK, implying that each of these viruses is being introduced to UK birds, possibly by mosquitoes. This is supported by nucleotide sequencing that identified three slightly different sequences ofWNVRNA in tissues of magpies and a blackbird. The detection of specific neutralizing antibodies to WNV in birds provides a plausible explanation for the lack of evidence of a decrease in the bird population in the UK compared with North America. The potential health risk posed to humans and animals by these viruses circulating in the UK is discussed. INTRODUCTION West Nile virus (WNV) is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Before its inadvertent introduction into North America in 1999, probably from Israel or Egypt (Lanciotti et al., 1999), it was known to be widespread throughout Eurasia (Hubalek & Halouzka, 1999). The virus was first isolated in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937 (Smithburn et al., 1940). Molecular epidemiological evidence indicates that WNV radiated from Africa northwards to the Mediterranean and southern European regions, eastwards to India, central and southern Asia and finally to Australia as Kunjin virus (Gould, 2002). The natural life cycle of this virus involves ornithophilic mosquitoes, particularly but not exclusively, Culex species, and birds that migrate between Africa, Europe and Asia (Work et al., 1955). Non-migratory birds become infected when WNV-infected mosquitoes feed on them. Evidence that the virus is transmitted between resident and migratory birds by infected mosquitoes can be obtained by detecting WNV-specific antibody, infectious virus or RNA in the non-migratory birds or in nearby animals. The risk of human epidemics is greatest in countries where ornitho- philic mosquitoes occur at high densities in urban areas near to slow moving rivers or large areas of water that attract migratory birds. The mosquitoes feed on the infected birds, become infected and amplify the virus, which is then transmitted to the next host on which the mosquito feeds. In 1996, an epidemic in Romania involved hundreds of human cases with 17 fatalities (Savage et al., 1999) and there are no obvious reasons at the moment why, in the future, similar epidemics should not spread throughout Europe. Recently, France (Murgue et al., 2000) and Italy (Cantile et al., 2000) have also experienced outbreaks of WN fever in horses and WNV-seropositive birds have been identified in Poland (Juricova et al., 1998) and the Czech Republic (Juricova et al., 1993). Serological studies on humans in the Ebro Delta, Spain, for antibodies to alphaviruses, flaviviruses and a bunyavirus showed an infection rate of 12?5% for at least one of the viruses tested. In Ampolla, San Jaime and Montells, 30% of human sera tested were positive for WNV antibodies (Lozano & Filipe, 1998). However, the most publicized emergence of WNV occurred in New York during the late summer of 1999. Within 2 months, 62 human cases of West Nile encephalitis and six fatalities were recorded (Roehrig et al., 2002). Subsequently, the virus overwintered successfully and dispersed throughout the Published ahead of print on 18 July 2003 as DOI 10.1099/ vir.0.19341-0 0001-9341 G 2003 SGM Printed in Great Britain 2807 Journal of General Virology (2003), 84, 2807–2817 DOI 10.1099/vir.0.19341-0 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:52:22 USA, causing more than 3600 confirmed cases and more than 270 deaths by the end of 2002. Usutu virus (USUV), which is closely related to WNV, was first isolated from mosquitoes in South Africa in 1959 (Woodhall, 1964). Subsequent isolations have been made from birds, mosquitoes and mammals, one from Praomys species and one from aman with fever and rash (Karabatsos, 1985). In Africa, the virus circulates between birds and mosquitoes with mammals being inadvertent hosts if bitten by infected mosquitoes. There are no reports of severe disease in man and USUV was known only in Africa prior to 2001 when it was isolated unexpectedly from birds dying of encephalitis in Vienna, Austria (Weissenbock et al., 2002). Sindbis virus (SINV), the type species of the genus Alphavirus, circulates in the same ecological habitat as WNV in Africa (Olson & Trent, 1985) and is transmitted between birds by ornithophilic Culex species of mosquito. Migratory birds transport the alphaviruses great distances and many migra- tory birds have antibodies to SINV. Moreover, SINV has been isolated from the blood and tissues of these birds (Ernek et al., 1977; Jupp et al., 1986), but there is no evidence that it causes mortality or sickness in these birds. A strain of SINV isolated in Finland in 1982 during an outbreak of polyarthritis was identified as being closely related to a South African virus isolated in 1963 (Shirako et al., 1991). From studies on the inland plateau and Natal lowlands in South Africa (Jupp et al., 1986), WNV and SINV have been shown to be transmitted to birds by the same mosquito species, particularly Culex univittatus. There are no published studies concerned with the presence of WNV, USUV or SINV in the UK and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that any of these viruses are endemic in the UK. However, many birds migrate annually from regions in Africa where WNV, USUV and SINV co-circulate and are actively transmitted between birds and mosquitoes. It is, therefore, possible that they are carried by birds to the UK and transmitted via indigenousmosquitoes to non-migratory birds and to other wildlife species. As part of a systematic programme of research to see whether or not such viruses are present and active in the UK, we initiated a survey for the presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in the sera of healthy migratory and non-migratory birds. Specific neutralizing antibodies againstWNV, USUV and SINVwere detected in the bird sera, implying that the viruses are being introduced into the UK by migrant birds and then trans- mitted to and within resident bird populations by local mosquitoes. METHODS Collection of samples from birds. Sera were collected from 30 different species of wild or farm birds: Turdus merula (blackbird); Sylvia attricapilla (blackcap); Buteo buteo (buzzard); Corvus corone (carrion crow); Fringilla coelebs (chaffinch); Gallus domesticus (free- range chicken); Anas platyrhynchos (domestic duck); Prunella modu- laris (dunnock); Sylvia borin (garden warbler); Parus major (great tit); Picus viridis (green woodpecker); Delichon urbica (house martin); Corvus monedula (jackdaw); Garrulus garrulus (jay); Falco tinnunculus (kestrel); Sylvia curruca (lesser whitethroat); Carduelis cannabina (linnet); Pica pica (magpie); Anthus pratensis (meadow pipit); Phoenicurus phoenicurus (redstart); Emberiza schoeniculus (reed bunting); Acrocephalus scirpaceus (reed warbler); Erithacus rubecula (robin); Acrocephalus schoenobaenus (sedge warbler); Turdus philo- melos (song thrush); Accipiter nisus (sparrowhawk); Sturnus vulgaris (starling); Hirundo rustica (swallow); Meleagris gallopavo (domestic turkey); Sylvia communis (whitethroat). Most birds were sampled in Cambridgeshire, UK (n=296) between October 2001 and September 2002, others, from Dorset (n=14), were obtained in May 2002 (mainly migrants returning to the UK) and south Wales (n=43, house martin and swallow) in August 2002 (migrants about to leave the UK). Carrion crows (n=26) and magpies (n=45) were trapped during pest control programmes and brains and sera were collected. Other species were caught in mist nets, bled and released. Amongst these were 69 juveniles, i.e. hatched during 2002 (15 species). Three species of free-range poultry (chicken, turkey and duck) were also sampled in Cambridgeshire in May 2002. Virus strains. WNV strain 99-34940-31A, designated WN-NY, isolated in New York State, USA in 1999, and WNV strain DAK Ar B 310, passage 13, designated WN-DAK, isolated from a mosquito collected in Central African Republic in 1967, were supplied by R. E. Shope and R. B. Tesh, University of Texas, USA. WNV isolated from Israel in the early 1980s, designated WN-Is, was supplied by M. Halevy, Israel Institute for Biological Research. USUV strain SAAR 1776, passage 9, isolated from a mosquito and designated USUV, was supplied by J. S. Porterfield, formerly of Oxford University, UK. SINV strain SAAR 86, passage 5, isolated from a mosquito pool and designated SINV, was supplied by J. Casals, for- merly of Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, USA. Louping ill virus, strain 91/330 Preston, from H. W. Reid, Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, UK, was isolated from a sheep and designated LIV. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Sera, heat- inactivated at 56 uC for 30 min, were coded and tested with no knowledge of their identity. They were diluted twofold from 1 : 10 to 1 : 320 in MEM with Earle’s salts (Invitrogen). Aliquots of diluted virus (125 ml) containing 50 p.f.u. were added to 125 ml of diluted serum and incubated at 37 uC for 1 h. Vero cell monolayers in 24-well tissue culture plates were washed with serum-free medium and drained before the virus/serum mixture was added and incu- bated at 37 uC for 1 h. The inoculum was removed from the cells and 1 ml 1?5% low-gelling-temperature agarose in MEM containing 2% FBS was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 5–7 days at 37 uC. Monolayers were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in saline, stained with 0?1% naphthalene black, washed, dried and the plaques were counted. Negative serum controls were included in each experiment. As the sera were obtained from healthy birds, it was assumed that antibody, if present, might be of low avidity and of low titre. Therefore, PRNT data were analysed by scoring the neutralization results at high and lower stringency as follows: firstly, the highest dilution of antibody that neutralized 90% of the plaques was recorded as the PRNT90 endpoint; secondly, using the same titrations, the highest dilution of antibody that neutralized 50% of the plaques was recorded as the PRNT50 endpoint. Indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests. WN-NY virus was used to infect Vero cells grown on glass coverslips for 40 h, which were then fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min. These cells were treated with 100 ml of diluted chicken serum and incubated at 37 uC for 45 min before washing in PBS at 37 uC for 10 min. Rabbit anti-chicken FITC-conjugated antibody (Sigma) was added at the recommended 2808 Journal of General Virology 84 A.

After washing in PBS, WNV-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 546) was added. Coverslips were incubated at 37 uC for 45 min, washed and sheep anti-mouse biotinylated antibody (Amersham) was added at the recommended dilution. After incubation for 45 min at 37 uC, the coverslips were washed and Texas red conjugated with Streptavidin (Amersham) was added for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed for 10 min in warm PBS and then transferred to warm water before drying and mounting in glycerol/DABCO on glass slides. An Olympus UV light microscope fitted with exclusion filters to observe fluorescein or Texas red fluorescence was used to examine the dual-labelled infected cells. Western blot analysis. Aliquots (50 ml) of normal and WN-NY virus-infected 20% (w/v) mouse brain suspension in PBS were diluted 1 : 1 with SDS-PAGE denaturing loading buffer and boiled for 3 min. Replicate 10 ml loadings were applied to a 10% polyacry- lamide gel, together with Seeblue-2 protein molecular mass markers (Novex). The gel was run at 200 V and then immersed in Western blotting buffer (20% MeOH, 20 mM Tris and 15 mM glycine) for 10 min before blotting onto an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, IVPH00010) at 12 V for 2 h. The membrane was cut into strips containing one track of each uninfected and WNV- infected brain sample. The strips were then incubated in blocking buffer (5%, w/v, milk powder and 0?01% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The test chicken or positive control mouse anti-WNV, antisera were diluted at 1 : 50, 1 : 250 and 1 : 500 in blocking buffer and added to individual strips of membrane that were incubated overnight at 4 uC. Strips were washed four times with blocking buffer and were then incubated with rabbit anti- chicken alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, F8888) or rabbit anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, A4312), as appropriate. All strips were then washed four times with blocking buffer and developed using Sigmafast NBT/BCIP (Sigma, B5655). RT-PCR sequencing. Viral RNA was extracted using the RNAgents kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used for nested RT-PCR were based on conserved regions of the known sequences of WNV (AF260967) and Kunjin (D00246) virus envelope protein. The nucleotide positions of the primers are as follows; first forward primer 1092–1114 (F1) and second forward primer 1181–1201 (F2); first reverse primer 2014–1995 (R1) and second reverse primer 1960–1941 (R2). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with primer R1. A nested PCR was used to amplify the DNA. The first reaction utilized primers F1 and R1 and the second F2 and R2 to produce a product of 779 bp. PCR products were gel-purified and both strands sequenced using a PE Biosystems cycle sequencing kit with primers F2 and R2. RESULTS Bird sera contain WNV- and/or USUV- and/or SINV-specific PRNT antibodies A total of 353 serum samples were obtained from either UK- resident or migrant birds and poultry showing no signs of disease. Since only small volumes were available for PRNT analysis for many of the sera, they were tested initially for WNV-specific antibodies using only the WN-NY strain of virus. Those for which the volumes were larger were also tested for antibodies against two other strains of WNV, one strain of SINV (113 samples) and one strain of USUV (91 samples). The only known endemic flavivirus in the UK is LIV. This tick-borne virus is antigenically distinguishable fromWNV by PRNT analysis. A strain of LIV was, therefore, included in all tests as a control reagent. The first set of results presented below was carried out using the high stringency PRNT90 method of analysis. Of the 353 sera tested, 52 (14?7%) were PRNT90 positive for WNV, with antibody titres ranging between 1/10 and 1/40. The results of these positive neutralization tests are shown in Fig. 1; they also include the species of bird from which sera were obtained and tested against each of the six viruses. Of the 52 WNV-positive sera, 36 neutralized only WN-DAK, nine neutralized onlyWN-NY, four neutralized onlyWN-Is, one neutralized WN-DAK and WN-Is, and the other two of the 52 WNV-positive sera were also positive for USUV. In addition, one serum sample was positive only for USUV and another was positive only for SINV. No sera were positive for LIV at the PRNT90 level. We conclude from these results that WNV is being introduced into a significant proportion of UK-resident birds, presumably by mosquitoes feeding on migrant birds. The PRNT90 endpoint is the standard method that has been used to identify WNV-neutralizing antibodies in dead and dying birds in the USA. However, this high stringency endpoint may not be appropriate for the UK since there is no evidence of disease in birds, and antibodies may be of much lower titres compared with birds in the USA and may also have low avidity. Therefore, since the control results were satisfactory, the neutralization data were re-scored using the lower stringency PRNT50 endpoint. The PRNT50 results (Table 1) using three strains of WNV, and USUV, SINV and LIV, also define the bird species from which each serum sample was collected. Of 353 bird sera, 66% were positive for WN-NY with neutralizing antibody titres ranging from 1/10 to >1/320. The two other strains of WNV (WN-DAK and WN-Is) produced higher [157 positive out of 172 tested (91?3%)] and slightly lower [84 positive out of 141 tested (59?6%)] proportions of positive sera. Two sera were positive against LIV; one of these, from a robin, was negative for WNV and the other, from a turkey, was positive for WNV. Of the 353 sera, 113 were analysed by PRNT50 using SINV: 57 (50?4%) contained detectable SINV-neutralizing anti- bodies and, of the 103 WNV-positive sera (i.e. from the 113 sera), 48 were negative for SINV. Therefore, more than 50% of the resident birds sampled during the early spring months had been exposed to both WNV and SINV. Also, 91 of the original bird sera representing eight species were tested for USUV-neutralizing antibodies and 49 of these (53?8%) were positive by the PRNT50 method. One serum sample from a magpie was positive for USUV and SINV but negative for WNV, and 35 of the 42 USUV- negative sera were positive for WNV, demonstrating that the PRNT50 method can discriminate between USUV- and WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies. It is also worth noting that in six of the sera, the titres against USUV were equal to or higher than those against WNV, implying that http://vir.sgmjournals.org 2809 Arboviruses in the UK bird population Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:52:22 these birds had been exposed to USUV and WNV. It is important to emphasize that even though a lower stringency threshold is being used, these results demonstrate specificity for each virus tested. Table 2 presents details of the PRNT50 results for which there was sufficient serum for all of the viruses to be tested. A wide range of results was obtained, including (a) WNV positive, (b) WNV and USUV positive, (c) WNV, USUV and SINV positive, (d) WNV and SINV positive, (e) USUV and SINV positive and (f) SINV positive. These results demonstrate (a) the high sensitivity and specificity of the test, (b) that individual UK-resident birds are being exposed to at least three different mosquito-transmitted arboviruses, and (c) that WNV, USUV and SINV are widespread throughout all of the sites investigated. Amongst the 353 sera, 75 were collected from juveniles, i.e. birds that had hatched during 2002 and were, therefore, unlikely to have left the UK. Of these 75 sera (Fig. 2), 35 produced WNV-positive PRNT50, implying that they had been exposed to infectious WNV in the UK during the first year of their lives. In contrast, six jackdaws that were unlikely to have been exposed to mosquitoes because they had been hand-reared indoors were negative in all PRNT assays. Detection of WNV antibodies by IF tests Whilst the PRNT is a robust and widely accepted method of demonstrating the presence of flavivirus-specific antibodies in sera, it was felt necessary to confirm by independent serological methods that the bird sera contained antibodies that react with WNV. Therefore, indirect IF tests were performed on four PRNT-positive and two PRNT-negative free-range chicken sera, using Vero cells infected with WN- NY. The cells were double-treatedwithWNV-positive chicken serum and aWNV-specific mAb (mAb 546). They were then labelled with fluorescein-conjugated anti-chicken serum (Sigma) and Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse serum (Sigma). Three of the four PRNT-positive chicken sera were positive in IF tests at a 1 : 1000 dilution and the fourth at a 1 : 100 dilution of serum (i.e. significantly higher titres than were observed by PRNT), producing WNV-specific cytoplasmic fluorescence in the virus-infected cells (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3(a), the chicken serum identified infected cells, as indicated by the brilliant white aggregates distributed around the nucleus of infected cells (illustrated in black and white). This pattern of fluorescence is identical to that produced by non-structural NS1 proteins (Gould et al., 1985), implying that the virus has replicated in the bird and stimulated NS1-specific antibodies. In Fig. 3(b), the cytoplasmic Fig. 1. Histogram depicting the percentage of antibody-positive bird sera, as determined by the PRNT90 method. The results are presented for each bird species tested against up to five viruses, i.e. WN-NY, WN-DAK, WN-Is, USUV and SINV, respectively. LIV (the sixth virus), which was the negative control, is not shown in the histogram. Each serum sample was titrated from 1/10 to 1/320. All sera showing at least 50% plaque reduction at a 1 : 10 dilution (or more) were considered positive. The numbers of bird sera tested against each virus, for each bird species, are shown above the columns. 2810 Journal of General Virology 84 A. Buckley and others Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:52:22 fluorescence obtained using a WNV E protein-specific mAb (Gould et al., 1990), in the same cells, shows a different distribution of the viral E protein, i.e. diffuse distribution (illustrated as a greyish-white colour). Confirmation of the presence of WNV-specific antibodies by Western blot analysis The presence of both E- and NS1-specific antibodies in chicken serum was also confirmed by Western blot analysis with optimized concentrations of WNV antigen and PRNT- positive chicken serum that labelled both E and NS1 proteins (Fig. 4). The control mouse anti-WNV serum (Fig. 4, track b), which was prepared using non-infectious WNV, labelled the E protein but not the NS1 protein. Detection of WNV-specific RNA in the sera and brains of birds A nested RT-PCR was performed to test for the presence of WNV RNA using primers based on WNV sequence in 60 bird sera and 32 brains of carrion crows and magpies. Five magpies (three sera and two brains) produced identical WNV-specific sequence (655 bp from the 779 bp PCR product) that differed by two nucleotides from the published New York strain of WNV. A sixth magpie produced a product with four nucleotide changes and one blackbird serum sample yielded a product with three nucleotide changes. The precise nucleotide substitutions, compared with the published New York strain, are shown in Table 3. Control positive and negative tests were included. All experiments were repeated and precautions were taken to Table 1.

These results confirm the presence of WNV in UK birds. At the present time, the same brain samples have yielded no RT-PCR products when appropriate SINV primers have been used. Failure to isolate infectious virus from healthy birds At the time of this work, it was not possible to attempt virus isolation using newborn mice. However, attempts were made to isolate infectious virus from 53 antibody-positive bird sera and 32 brains of carrion crows or magpies by placing 50 ml of serum or brain suspension diluted in 1 ml MEM onto Vero cell monolayers in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubating the monolayers at 37 uC for up to 7 days. Immunofluorescence microscopy using the WNV- specific mAb 546 or a SINV-specific mAb 30.11 (Chanas et al., 1982) and a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse serum were used to test each culture for the presence of virus.

Serial passage of the supernatant medium onto fresh Vero cells also failed to isolate infectious virus. DISCUSSION Although the scope of this investigation is limited by the number and volumes of bird sera available for analysis, we conclude that at least three arboviruses, WNV, USUV and SINV, have been introduced into UK-resident birds from migrant birds, as identified in sera collected in 2001 and 2002. The observation that sera collected from resident birds contain neutralizing antibodies against WNV, USUV and SINV, and the antibody-positive results with the juvenile birds, imply that these viruses are being actively trans- mitted to the indigenous UK bird population. Moreover, a relatively high proportion of resident birds were positive, implying efficient transmission from the migrant bird population. Further support for the view that WNV is present in resident birds in the UK was also obtained by RT-PCR sequencing of RNA extracted from sera and brain tissue of magpies and a blackbird, i.e. resident birds. Because mosquito densities in the UK are relatively low compared with warmer countries, such as North America, southern Europe, Africa and Asia, the likelihood of success- ful transfer of the virus to local birds frommigrants might be expected to be low. However, using high stringency analysis, i.e. PRNT90, 22?7% (36 positives from 172 tested usingWN- DAK virus) of the UK bird sera tested were shown to have neutralizing antibodies against WN-DAK and 3?3 and 0?9% had neutralizing antibodies against USUV or SINV, 30 25 <1/10 1/160 1/80nd 1/40 1/20 1/1020 15 N um be r o f b ird s 10 5 0 S w al lo w H ou se M ar tin B la ck c ap B la ck b ird "

Although a great deal is known about them, detailed information is needed to explain the astonishing variations of their anatomy, their lifestyles, their roles in ecosystems ecol- ogy, and their importance as reservoir hosts of viruses of proven or potential significance for human and veterinary health. Bats fly with wings which range in span from 130 mm to 2 m. Bats of various species feed on insects, mammals, fish, blood, fruit, and pollen. Bats of most species echolocate to navigate and to find prey. Bats are found on all continents except Ant- arctica. Bats also are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts for viruses which can cross species barriers (i.e., “spill over”) to infect humans and other domestic and wild mam- mals. Nonetheless, studies of the natural histories of bats and their importance as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses largely have been underappreciated and underfunded, except for their role in maintaining and transmitting rabies virus. Irrespective of the negative public perception of bats, they are critical elements of all terrestrial biotic communities. They help con- trol insects, reseed cut forests, and pollinate plants that provide food for humans and other species, and their guano is used as a fertilizer and for manufacturing soaps, gasohol, and antibi- otics (21, 69, 83). Bat echolocation and signal processing have provided models for sonar systems (112, 130). Myths and misunderstandings about the roles of bats in ecosystems and their danger to other species as hosts of rabies virus have led to efforts to extirpate bat populations, with serious consequent effects on insect control and crop produc- tion, without coincidental reduction in the already low inci- dence of rabies virus transmission by bats (93). This paper summarizes what is known about viruses isolated from bats.

Some of these bat-borne viruses can cause diseases of humans and other animals. The roles played by bats in the maintenance and transmission of viruses require consideration of the unique characteristics that distinguish bats from all other mammals. Examples are drawn from the extensive literature on rabies virus in bats, as well as from recent data on the roles of bats in the natural cycles of other viruses. Evolution and Phylogeny of Bats Whereas other mammals, such as certain species of rodents (order Rodentia) and carnivores (order Carnivora), may pos- sess traits in common with species of bats, such as the ability to hibernate, no group of mammals shares the full suite of at- tributes that make bats unique. Of the more than 4,600 recog- nized species of mammals, 925 (about 20%) are bats (147). Bats are grouped into two suborders: Megachiroptera, contain- ing a single family, Pteropodidae (42 genera, comprising 166 species), and Microchiroptera, containing 16 bat families (135 genera, comprising 759 species) (Table 1) (138). Bats evolved early and have changed relatively little in com- parison with mammals of other taxa (69). Although the fossil record of bat evolution is incomplete (77), a recent analysis of 17 nuclear genes dated the origin of chiropterans to the Eo- cene period (52 to 50 million years ago), coincident with a significant rise in global temperature (147). Three major mi- crochiropteran lineages were traced to Laurasia and a fourth to Gondwana (147). The correspondingly ancient origins de- duced for certain zoonotic viruses maintained in bats, such as the henipaviruses (60) and lyssaviruses (10), suggest a long history of cospeciation. Viruses that evolved with bats may have used for replication cellular receptors and biochemical pathways which are conserved in mammals that evolved later and which underwent radiation in later geological periods. If so, these conserved cellular receptors and pathways could en- hance the capacity for transmission of bat-associated viruses to other mammals. Ability To Fly Bats are unique among mammals in their ability to fly. Bats fly daily in pursuit of food, and bats of many species fly long distances during seasonal migrations (62). For example, bats of Myotis spp. may travel 200 to 400 miles from their winter hibernation sites (reviewed in reference 62), and Mexican free- tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) migrate at least 800 miles between their summer caves in Texas and New Mexico and their overwintering sites in Mexico (36) and are otherwise very widely distributed. In France, rabies virus infections have been associated with the migratory routes of Nathusius’ pipis- trelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) bats (20). Silver-haired bats (La- sionycteris noctivagans) seasonally range from Alaska, across Canada, and south to Texas (13). Rabies virus variants associ- ated with silver-haired bats and the Eastern pipistrelle (Pipis- trellus subflavus) have been identified from numerous locations throughout the geographic range of these bats (106, 124), and the same variants have been identified as the cause of the majority of cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the United States and Canada (127). Different patterns of migration within the same species of bat, as occurs with relatively solitary species, such as the silver- haired bat (69), and colonial cave-dwelling species, such as Mexican free-tailed bats (128), may permit exchange of novel viruses or virus variants between migrating and nonmigrating subpopulations of conspecifics or bats of other species. A Mex- ican free-tailed bat infected with a rabies virus variant normally associated with hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), suggests inter- species transmission (124). In the field, rabid bats of one spe- cies have been observed to be aggressive toward bats of other species (14). Moreover, Shankar et al. (136), in a study of the phylogenesis of divergence of rabies viruses from bats and terrestrial animals in Colorado, found that bats of different species had the same genotypic variants, indicating active in- terspecies transmission of rabies virus. They concluded that, at least in Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats and that identification of bat-associated variants of rabies viruses in domestic cats, gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) demonstrates the impor- tance of rabies virus spillover from bats to domestic and ter- restrial wild vertebrates. Torpor and Hibernation An important trait of temperate bats of the families Vesper- tilionidae and Rhinolophidae is their ability to enter into daily torpor and seasonal hibernation to conserve energy during cool nights and winter months (89). The impact of torpor and hibernation on the pathogenesis and maintenance of viral in- fections in bats has not been studied extensively. However, viruses may overwinter in bats, and persistently infected bats may shed viruses, such as lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae) or flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) for extensive periods with- out evidence of disease (143). Virus isolation and antibody studies suggest that many viruses can cause persistent infec- tions in bats (82). When big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifigus) were experimentally infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and then subjected to temperatures TABLE 1.

CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV. Nevertheless, the fact that infectious JEV was recovered from seropositive bats 15 weeks after the shift in temperature indicated that infection persisted (143). It is pos- sible that neutralizing antibody has a shorter half-life in bats than in other mammals. Tick-borne encephalitis virus and other viruses have been isolated from bats with neutralizing antibody, and bats are susceptible to reinfection with tick- borne encephalitis viruses (82). High titers of virus were obtained from brown fat of appar- ently healthy bats inoculated with rabies virus when the bats were kept at low temperatures (4, 142, 143). Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) that survive challenge with rabies virus may excrete virus in their saliva (1). Rabies virus was isolated from big brown bats that were captured to establish colonies and then died in the first month of captivity (135). Antiviral antibodies were detected in sera of several apparently healthy bats born in the new colony, suggesting past or subclinical rabies virus infection (135). Mexican free-tailed bats may trans- mit rabies virus transplacentally, as evidenced by the fact that infectious virus was isolated from cell lines established from fetal tissues of these bats (141). Studies of Mexican free-tailed bats roosting at a colony in Austin, Texas, identified rabies virus in about 70% of several hundred downed, dead, or dying bats, which represented a relatively small proportion of the estimated 600,000 bats in that colony. Over the study’s 2-year duration, about 45% of apparently healthy bats from this roost were found to have neutralizing antibody to rabies virus, sug- gesting acquired immunity following prior exposure (101; C. Rupprecht [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.], personal communication, 2006). Because only one or another of many methods usually is applied in studies of rabies virus in bats, we do not know the proportion of bats having both viral RNA in their tissues and antibody to rabies virus. Temperate and tropical bats of the family Molossidae ap- pear to be transitional between true hibernating bats and trop- ical bats that have limited ability to enter torpor. For example, the Western bonneted bat (Eumops perotis) enters a period of daily torpor during the winter that is similar to the daily hiber- nation or torpor that occurs in temperate zone bats during the summer (89). Long Life Span The extreme longevity of bats, together with the possibility that they might develop persistent infections with certain vi- ruses, may help maintain the viruses and transmit them to other vertebrates. Many species of small temperate bats of the suborder Microchiroptera have life spans that exceed 25 years, with the greatest longevity, of 35 years, documented for a little brown bat. (On average, little brown bats weigh about 7 g.) This extreme longevity in a small mammal places bats well outside the traditional regression line for mammals that relates the life expectancy (9) to the ratio of metabolic rate to body weight (see reference 44, Fig. 45). If bats routinely become persistently infected by certain vi- ruses, and infectivity lasts for months or possibly years, the impact on the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) would be significant. R0 is the expected number of newly in- fected hosts that one infectious host will produce during its period of infectiousness in a large population of completely susceptible individuals (65). Since R0 is the sum of the products of the average duration of infection, the average contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, and the prob- ability of transmission per contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual, increased duration of infectiousness or increased prevalence of infection in a population can dramat- ically enhance the potential for secondary infections that em- anate from a single infected individual. Persistent viral infec- tions occurring among long-lived bats, coupled with their often gregarious roosting behavior, could greatly increase the poten- tial for intra- and interspecies transmission of viruses. Population Size and Roosting Behavior The frequently great population densities of bats and their crowded roosting behavior increase the likelihood of intra- and interspecies transmission of viral infections. Bats are the most abundant of mammals, and except for humans and perhaps rodents, they are the most widely distributed land mammals (154). Certain species of bats, such as Mexican free-tailed bats, are highly gregarious and roost in southwestern caves of the United States, such as Carlsbad Caverns and Frio Cave, in densely packed aggregates of approximately 300 bats per ft2 (37), in populations comprising several million individuals (37, 94). Under these conditions the only example of airborne ra- bies virus transmission was documented, either in droplets of excreta or by small particle aerosol (38, 155). Bat Population Structure The demographic and spatial structuring of bat populations is sufficiently variable to offer opportunities for viruses that cause both acute and persistent infections to be maintained. The potential for migratory and nonmigratory populations to serve as a mixing vessel for viruses has already been men- tioned. Additionally, within given regions, bat populations may be panmictic or may exist as metapopulations, offering the potential for seasonal virus transmission and annual outbreaks of viral diseases as well as the potential for periodic outbreaks among spatially discrete populations. Colonial microchiropterans (such as Schreibers’ long-fin- gered bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Mexican free-tailed bats) typically exist in panmictic populations of hundreds of thousands or millions of individuals and produce an annual birth pulse (37). In theory, such large bat populations could sustain acute viral infections that produce permanent steriliz- ing immunity in affected individuals in a manner akin to that of measles morbillivirus, which persists to cause annual outbreaks only when human communities exceed 250,000 to 500,000 (16). The persistence of measles virus within demographically het- erogeneous human populations, whereby different communi- ties are affected in different years, may give rise to viral per- sistence in spatially discrete “patches,” in which infection dies out sequentially rather than simultaneously (17). A different pattern of social structure is present among other colonial bats that have a metapopulation structure (consisting of periodically interacting, spatially discrete subpopulations). Flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) have such a structure. In this sit- uation, the total number of individuals in the various subpopu- VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 535 lations or “patches” must be sufficient to maintain virus circu- lation in the metapopulation over time, while immunity or death due to viral infection extinguishes transmission chains within individual subpopulations. Periodic outbreaks of viral infection and disease may then be expected among given sub- populations in a region, once the number of susceptible indi- viduals has recovered through births or loss of immunity, such that the populations once again can support viral transmission with an R0 of �1. Such periodic outbreaks of acute, even fatal viral disease are well documented for rabies virus among ter- restrial carnivores (28) and may occur among vampire bats, as exemplified by the so-called “migration” of rabies virus in vampire bat populations in different regions with a 2- t"

Nicoli’’ (CAA), Crevalcore, Italy, 3 Servizio Veterinario Azienda USL Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, 4 DG Sanità e Politiche Sociali, Regione Emilia-Romagna, Bologna, Italy Abstract Background: The circulation of West Nile virus and Usutu virus was detected in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the extent of circulation of both viruses, environmental surveillance, based on bird and mosquito testing, was conducted in 2008 and gradually improved over the years. Methods: In February–March 2009–2011, 5,993 hibernating mosquitoes were manually sampled, out of which 80.1% were Culex pipiens; none tested positive for the viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946,213 mosquitoes, sampled between May and October, were tested; 86.5% were Cx. pipiens. West Nile virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and Usutu virus was detected in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011, of 4,546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48 for Usutu virus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus showed different patterns of activity during the 2008–2011 surveillance period. West Nile virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. Usutu virus, however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. Conclusions: The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird species could explain the decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the persistence of Usutu virus may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the environment after two to three years of obvious circulation.

The high identity from partial nucleotide sequencing of positive mosquitoes, humans, and wild birds suggests that the virus overwintered rather than being re- introduced several times [2], [3], [4]. Usutu virus (USUV) has been detected in the same area since 2009 [3], [5], and biomolecular data demonstrate that the virus has overwintered in Emilia-Romagna [2]. This flavivirus was first reported in Europe in Vienna in 2001 [6]; from there, the virus was reported in neighboring countries and has become endemic [7]. Both viruses belong to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex [8] and are phylogenetically closely related [9], but while WNV is a known pathogen for humans, the pathogenicity of USUV to humans is not fully understood [10], [11]. Similar to other arboviruses (vector-borne viruses), WNV and USUV exploit complex biotic and trophic interactions between vectors and reservoirs, to persist in a particular area. These interactions are influenced by numerous ecological and environ- mental factors that can confer unique characteristics on the virus cycle in a particular ecosystem, including differential ways of transmission and permanence. Due to this variability, character- izing the epidemiological picture in a specific environment, identifying all transmission ways and discovering the predominant ones, is difficult. This is especially true for WNV, which may exploit many arthropod vectors and reservoir species [12]. Certainly, wild birds are the most significant reservoir species for WNV, with different viremia duration and intensity according to the species [13], and a different role in virus transmission PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63978 according to the species abundance. The USUV cycle, however, is less well known but seems to be similar to the WNV cycle. Overwintering is a critical point for virus permanence in temperate regions. Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain overwintering of arboviruses. When the vector survives from one season to the next by arresting development and reducing metabolism (diapause), as in the case of the Culex pipiens mosquito, the virus can persist in the adult vector. The virus can also survive the winter in the vector eggs, or more rarely, in the juvenile stages, when they are the diapausing stages [14]. Vertebrates can also contribute to arbovirus overwintering. For example, a delayed viremia can be produced in hibernating animals at their awakening, or in some specimens a recurrent or long-lasting viremia could be produced, or the virus could persist in specific organs of animals, and be reactivated after ingestion by predators or scavengers [14], producing an infection. Since 2008, an environmental surveillance program targeted toward WNV and USUV has been active in the Emilia-Romagna region [15], [16]. This system has been improved over the years, and this paper reports the 2011 monitoring results. To explain the permanence mechanisms of the two viruses in the region, the data obtained in previous years [2], [3], [5], [16] were also analyzed retrospectively. Results Surveillance results for 2011 Mosquitoes. From February 11 to March 14, 4,109 over- wintering mosquitoes were sampled manually from winter hibernacula (of which 3,524, equal to 80.1%, were Cx. pipiens) (Table 1). A particular effort was made in the Modena province, where 2,333 mosquitoes were collected at one site on three sampling days (1985 Cx. pipiens, 348 An. maculipennis s.l.), and 699 Cx. pipiens specimens were collected at another site during one day. At three sites, by using carbon dioxide attraction traps weekly from March 10 to May 20, 258 mosquitoes were collected, of which 252 (97.7%) belonged to the species Cx. pipiens (Table 2). From May 31 to October 19, a total of 269,686 mosquitoes, grouped in 2,451 pools, were collected with carbon dioxide (CO2) baited traps and analyzed; 227,754 specimens were sampled with plan traps, 41,316 were sampled with Modena traps, and 616 were sampled with extra-plan traps. The sites sampled are shown in Figure 1. The most abundant species was Cx. pipiens (86.4% of tested mosquitoes), followed by Aedes caspius (10.2%), Ae. vexans (2.3%), and Ae. albopictus (0.9%) (Table 3). Other species sampled, but at low density (under 0.2%), were Anopheles maculipennis s.l., Cx. modestus, Coquillettidia richiardii, and An. plumbeus (Table 3). Several sites were sampled in 2010 and 2011, and included 80 plan trap stations and 31 Modena trap stations. For both trap groups, the number of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes per night was higher in 2010 than in 2011. The average number of mosquitoes/trap/ night was 707.6 (1,156.7 s.d.) in 2010 and 340.9 (570.1 s.d.) in 2011 for the plan traps (p,0.01) and 266.2 (171.9 s.d.) in 2010 and 114.0 (67.3 s.d.) in 2011 for the Modena traps (p,0.01). Birds. A total of 1,068 wild birds, collected within the specific wildlife population control program between January and November, were tested. Three corvid species were the most represented species: Eurasian Magpies (Pica pica, 558 specimens), Hooded Crows (Corvus cornix, 415 specimens), and Eurasian Jays (Garrulus glandarius, 68 specimens). Moreover, 26 European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) were actively collected (Table 4). Another 245 birds, belonging to 68 species, were passively collected: 332 specimens (79.4%) came from wildlife rehabilitation centers (WRCs), and 86 (20.6%) were found dead in the field (Table 4). The most commonly passively collected birds were 40 Eurasian Collared-Doves (Streptopelia decaocto), 37 Eurasian Black- birds (Turdus merula), 35 Common Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), and 29 Little Owls (Athene noctua). Detection and isolation of viruses The viruses were not detected in overwintering mosquitoes or in the mosquitoes sampled early in the season. Assuming a potential USUV minimum infection rate of 0.4, obtained with the 2010 data (213,235 Cx. pipiens specimens sampled from the sampling of the first USUV-positive pool and 89 USUV-positive pools), at least one USUV-positive mosquito was expected among the 3,524 overwintering Cx. pipiens mosquitoes sampled. In 2011, all mosquito pools tested negative for WNV, while 74 Cx. pipiens pools, six Ae. albopictus pools, one Ae. caspius pool, and one An. maculipennis s.l. pool were USUV positive (Table 3, Figure 1). Fifty-four of these pools were sampled with plan traps and 28 with Modena traps. The first Cx. pipiens USUV-positive pool was sampled in the province of Bologna on July 14, and the last was sampled in the province of Modena on September 30 (Figure 2). The first Ae. albopictus USUV-positive pools were sampled on July 22 and the last on October 4, both in the province of Modena. The positive An. maculipennis s.l. pool and the Ae. caspius pool were sampled on September 13 with a Modena trap. Flavivirus sequences were detected in 22 Ae. albopictus pools and in three Ae. caspius pools; these sequences had a high identity rate for Aedes flavivirus and Ochlerotatus flavivirus, respectively, two mosquito-only flaviviruses previously reported in Italy [17]. No birds tested positive for WNV; however, 25 were USUV positive. Of these birds, 14 were collected in active surveillance, and 11 were collected in passive surveillance. Almost all positive birds collected in active surveillance were Magpies (13/14), and one was a Eurasian Jay. Of these birds, six birds were sampled in Bologna province, five were sampled in Ravenna province, and three were sampled in Ferrara province. In passive surveillance, one Magpie was positive for USUV. Of the other birds passively Table 1.

None of these birds was found dead on the field. The permanence time in the WRC was available for eight birds. Only a Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) was hospitalized for 10 days, while the other died within two days after admission, including the Greater Spotted Eagle (Aquila clanga) that was recovered in poor condition and died shortly after admission. Of these birds, seven came from Ferrara province, two from Reggio Emilia province, and two from Rimini province. The first bird to test positive for USUV was the Greater Spotted Eagle collected in Reggio Emilia province on April 12, and the last was a Starling collected on October 18. Both birds died at a WRC shortly after admission. USUV was successfully isolated from a Blackbird that died at a WRC in Ferrara province on September 22 and from a Cx. pipiens pool of mosquitoes (47 specimens) that were sampled in Rimini province on September 11. USUV sequence The 42 sequences obtained with the flavivirus-genus PCR showed an identity range of 99.1% to 100% out of 214 positions compared. Compared to the 2009 sequence, the 2011 sequence differed by one base pair (bp) and by another base pair compared to the 2010 consensus sequences (out of 264 bp compared). Interestingly, one of these mutations was present in the 2010 and 2011 partial NS5 consensus sequences, but was not present in the 2009 consensus sequence or in any other GB sequence (G.A in genomic position 9060 of EF206350). This mutation could have been acquired while the virus was expanding. The 55 sequences obtained with USUV-specific PCR showed inter-identity ranging from 99.4% to 100%, out of 361 positions compared. The 2011 PCR consensus sequences were identical to the 2009 and 2010 consensus sequences obtained from the mosquitoes and birds sampled in the Emilia-Romagna region [2], [3]. There were no mutations in the obtained sequences; therefore, no changes were observed in the sequence of the translated proteins. Surveillance results from 2009 to 2010 Mosquitoes. In March 2009 and 2010, overwintering mosquitoes were sampled manually from winter hibernacula. In 2010, 894 specimens were collected (of which 764, equal to 85.0%, were Cx. pipiens) at 50 sites selected within a 5 km radius from stations that had at least one positive mosquito pool in 2009. In 2009, 991 female specimens (of which 512, i.e., 51.7%, were Cx. pipiens) (Table 1) were collected in 28 suitable sites in areas with WNV-positive horses, birds, and mosquito pools in 2008 [1], [16]. The different ratio between the two species recorded in this year was probably due to the high density of An. maculipennis in the sampled area and to the wide seasonal variations in the density of the two species, which may also affect the number of overwinter- ing specimens. Early seasonal samples were collected at 48 sites in April 2009, and 2,587 mosquitoes were collected. A high proportion of these were Cx. pipiens (2,040 specimens, 78.9% of the total) (Table 2). In 2010, 438,558 mosquitoes collected between May and October were tested [2], 190,516 in 2009 [3] and 47,453 in 2008 [16]. Of these mosquitoes, Cx. pipiens was the most abundant species, with 585,297 specimens and an overall rate of 86.5% (90.9% in 2010, 81.4% in 2009, 66.2% in 2008). Birds. In 2010, a total of 1,596 birds were tested: 1,385 were actively collected, and 211 were obtained passively. Of these birds, 157 (74.4%) were from WRCs, and 54 (25.6%) were found dead in the field (Table 5). In 2009, 1,464 birds were tested: 1,378 were actively collected, and 86 were passively collected. Of these birds, 60 (69.8%) were from WRCs, and 26 (30.2%) were found dead in the field (Table 5). These results are partially reported in Calzolari et al. [2] and Tamba et al. [5]. Detection of viruses. Neither virus was detected in the overwintering mosquitoes tested in 2009 and 2010.

WNV was detected in 40 birds in 2009 and in two birds in 2010. USUV was detected in 11 birds in 2009: seven actively collected and four passively collected (of which two Blackbirds found dead in the field). USUV was detected in 12 birds in 2010, one actively collected and 11 passively collected (of which two Blackbirds found dead in the field) (Table 5, Table S1). The permanence time in a WRC was recovered for six of these birds. All died within two days after arrival. Positive bird species are reported in Table S1. The details of and results for the mosquitoes collected from May to October in 2008–2010 and birds collected from May to October in 2010 and from May to November in 2009 have been reported in previous publications [2], [3], [5], [16]. Estimation of reservoir importance of bird populations. An estimation of the relative reservoir importance of birds tested in active surveillance was performed using 2009 data, a year with a relevant WNV circulation. The infection rate of Magpies, Crows, Jays and Starlings was found by utilizing data from surveyed areas, and then the number of potential infected specimens were estimated according to the bird abundance (Table 6). In the 2009 scenario, among the four actively collected species, Starlings seemed to be the more important WNV- reservoir hosts, followed by Magpies. Due to the low number of USUV-positive birds actively collected, this estimation was not performed for USUV. Discussion WNV and USUV showed different patterns of activity during the surveillance period 2008–2011 in the Emilia-Romagna region. WNV was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but in 2011 no positive birds or mosquitoes were reported. However, USUV was Figure 2.

Despite the limited length of the 2011 USUV sequences, obtained with the two diagnostic PCRs, the high identity with previous year sequences suggests that the virus overwintered in the region [2]. Previous data also strongly sustain the hypothesis of overwintering for WNV between 2008 and 2010 [2], [3], [4]. The geographic distribution of the viruses in the territory over several years of surveillance also supports the hypothesis of overwintering of both viruses, rather than different reintroductions. A possible mechanism of arbovirus overwintering in temperate climates could be through infected diapausing mosquitoes [14], [18]. USUV-positive mosquitoes in diapause have been reported in Europe [19]. Furthermore, WNV-positive overwintering mosquitoes were detected several times in the United States [20], [21], [22], [23], but always at low rates, and often after seasons with a high infection rate in mosquitoes [23]. Moreover, a reduced overwintering capacity was recorded in engorged mosquitoes [24], and various field observations reported a low parous rate in mosquitoes in diapause, which decreased during the winter [25], [26], often reaching zero at the new season start [27]. In addition to this scarce probability of virus overwintering in directly infected diapausing mosquitoes, vertical transmission could be another mechanism supporting WNV overwintering. Vertical transmission of the virus has been shown by WNV detected in mosquito larvae sampled in the field [28] and in adults reared from field-collected larvae [17], [29]. However, a low rate of vertical transmission was often found in WNV experimental infection of mosquitoes [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], suggesting that this phenomenon is rare in nature. Furthermore, if virus overwintering did occur in mosquitoes, it would have to occur in enough infected mosquitoes to restart viral circulation in the following season. This number must be sufficient to ensure the passage of the virus to a competent host, since a female mosquito feeds a limited number of times, to mature the eggs. Limited presence of blood from different hosts was found in engorged Cx pipiens mosquitoes, which seems to demonstrate that multiple feeding is a rare event for this species [36], [37], [38], and therefore limits the capacity of this species to transmit the virus. During the three years of surveillance, two overwintering mosquito species were sampled more abundantly, Cx. pipiens (80.1%) and An. maculipennis s.l. (19.8%), but none tested positive, despite the large sampling effort expended in areas where positive mosquito pools had been sampled the previous summer. Furthermore, the first positive mosquito pool was recorded in July, even though mosquito sampling was performed early in the season (Table 2) and the majority of sampling started in June. The data suggest that diapausing mosquitoes were not the main source of virus overwintering in the Emilia-Romagna region; another mechanism probably exists. Vertebrate hosts could also provide a way for viruses to overwinter. Long-term viremia was described in the House Sparrow [39]. WNV was detected in the urine of human convalescent patients [40] and in the kidneys of laboratory hamsters [41] months after infection, showing the virus persists for long periods in some organs. Ingestion of infected animals by susceptible hosts, by hunting or carrion-feeding behavior, may be an alternative virus transmission method [13], [14], [39], [42]. The mortality of birds at the end of winter could facilitate this mechanism of infection in opportunistic scavengers, such as European Magpies and Hooded Crows, and, therefore, WNV overwintering in birds. The relevance of this mechanism in WN and USU viruses overwintering in Emilia-Romagna seems to be confirmed by finding birds that tested positive for the viruses early in the season, when the mosquito density was low, as the Spotted Eagle died on April 12, 2011, and tested USUV-positive, and the WNV-positive magpie was sampled in May 2009 [5]. The surveillance system reported an increase in WNV circulation from 2008 to 2009, with a successive decrease in 2010, and failed to detect the virus in 2011 (Table 5), despite comparable sampling effort. Herd immunity within the reservoir bird populations could explain the drastic drop in WNV circulation, as already reported [43]. In effect, durable and Table 5.

This reported decline in WNV circulation is consistent with the dynamic observed in many European countries, with a progressive decrease in WNV activity in the years after the first onset of an outbreak [45], [46]. These reports and our results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of WNV lineage 1 related strains, which disappeared from an area, or circulated into nidus at an undetectable sylvatic cycle, after about two to three years of epidemic circulation, perhaps due to the trigger of herd immunity, and are probably transported to a new territory by short-ranging migrant birds, not necessarily from Sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition, an relevant number of Common Starlings was tested, of which five tested WNV-positive in 2009 [5] (Table S1). Crows are more abundant in Emilia-Romagna western part and in specific environments, like poplar plantations, while Magpies are more abundant in eastern part of the region, especially in particular plain environments [47]. Although the three corvids are sedentary in Emilia-Romagna, Common Starlings have a different tendency to migrate, and large part of the regional population is sedentary [47], [48]. These birds belong to the Passeriformes order, and a primary reservoir role was recognized for passerines from experimental studies [13] and European field data [49]. Moreover, these birds are abundant in Emilia-Romagna, so they are good candidates for WNV-reservoir hosts. According to the abundance estimation and 2009 data, a more important reservoir role between these species could be assigned to Starlings and Magpies (Table 6). These two species are more abundant in the plains and prefer arable land and urban area compared to Crows and Jays, which prefer woodland areas, and are more common at higher altitude [47], [50]. According to the habitat preference of Starling and Magpie, the number of mosquito WNV-positive pools was significantly higher in rural areas in 2009 [3], confirming the greater circulation of this virus in a rural environment. Moreover, the observed two- to three-year decline in WNV circulation is in accordance with the 90% turnover in the population of possible bird reservoirs, such as the European Starling, which was estimated with ringing activity [48]. This is consistent with a primary role in the WNV herd immunity mechanism carried out by hatch year birds, which has been reported in the United States [51]. The high rate of immunization in hatch year birds could be due to greater exposure to mosquito bites, higher sensitivity to the virus, and the possible direct passage of the virus to the nestling, as mechanisms of passive immunity from mother to offspring exist but seem to have a short duration [52]. In contrast to WNV, the circulation of USUV did not show evidence of a decrease. After the virus in 2009 was first detected, the surveillance system constantly detected this virus in mosquitoes and birds until 2011, with similar prevalence in different years (Table 5). Possible cross immunization between USUV and WNV could influence this dynamic. However, birds tested positive for both viruses, which was reported in the Emilia-Romagna region [2], [5] seems to rule out this hypothesis. The absence of a decrease in the circulation of USUV (Table 5) could be due to a different mechanism of immunity in birds for the two viruses; however, a USUV herd immunity phenomenon was described in Austria [53]. If this is the case, the persistence of this virus could be explained by not yet identified reservoirs, in addition to wild birds, unable to develop sufficient herd immunity due to an ineffective immune response or because of a fast population turnover, as in the case of rodents [14].

"Cao-2011-Tembusu virus in ducks, china.pdf"	"Dispatches.indd Tembusu Virus in Ducks, China Zhenzhen Cao,1 Cun Zhang,1 Yuehuan Liu,1 Weicheng Ye, Jingwen Han, Guoming Ma, Dongdong Zhang, Feng Xu, Xuhui Gao, Yi Tang, Shaohua Shi, Chunhe Wan, Chen Zhang, Bin He, Mengjie Yang, Xinhao Lu, Yu Huang, Youxiang Diao, Xuejun Ma, and Dabing Zhang In China in 2010, a disease outbreak in egg-laying ducks was associated with a fl avivirus. The virus was isolated and partially sequenced. The isolate exhibited 87%–91% identity with strains of Tembusu virus, a mosquito- borne fl avivirus of the Ntaya virus group. These fi ndings demonstrate emergence of Tembusu virus in ducks. From June through November 2010 in the People’s Republic of China, a disease characterized by a sudden onset was observed on many egg-laying and breeder duck farms. Egg production in affected ducks dropped severely within 1–2 weeks after disease onset. Other consistent signs included acute anorexia, antisocial behavior, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, ataxia, and paralysis. Rate of illness was usually high (up to 90%), and mortality rates varied from 5% to 30%. From affected ducks we isolated and identifi ed a Tembusu virus (TMUV). The Study During the outbreak, we examined 11 diseased ducks (7 Pekin ducks, 3 Cherry Valley Pekin ducks, and 1 Shaoxing duck) from 5 duck farms in 4 provinces. At necropsy, viscera samples (e.g., brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, theca folliculi) were collected and placed in 10% buffered formalin. Sections were embedded in paraffi n and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The theca folliculi from each duck were also used for virus isolation or detection by PCR. The main pathologic changes observed consistently in almost all diseased ducks were found in the ovaries: hyperemia, hemorrhage, degeneration, distortion, macrophage and lymphocyte infi ltration, and hyperplasia; in the liver, interstitial infl ammation was found in the portal area (Figure l, panels A–C). On the basis of these changes, the disease was designated duck hemorrhagic ovaritis. After samples underwent several rounds of screening and identifi cation attempts, we concluded that a new virus infection was the most likely cause of the disease. One virus strain, designated YY5, was isolated from the Shaoxing duck after inoculation of clarifi ed theca folliculus suspension into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old specifi c pathogen–free chicken embryos. The embryos died 72–120 hours after inoculation, and severe cutaneous hemorrhages were observed. Because eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been shown to cause paralysis in Pekin ducks (1), we performed EEE virus–specifi c nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (2) to detect the isolate. RNA was extracted by using the TranZol RNA Extraction Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primer pairs used to amplify the E2 gene of EEE virus (EEE-4 and cEEE- 7, EEE-5 and cEEE-6) have been described (2). A clear PCR product (268 bp) resulted and was then sequenced; the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with other sequences by using a BLASTP (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/Blast.cgi) search in GenBank. Unexpectedly, a 221-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641388) was shown to encode the nonstructural (NS) 1 protein of fl avivirus, which exhibited 73%–85% identity to fl aviviruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus groups, such as Bagaza virus (GenBank accession no. ACG60714, [3]) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (GenBank accession no. ABN11829 [4]). The result demonstrated the possible presence of a fl avivirus in ducks. To further confi rm fl avivirus as the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis, we used PCR to test the isolate and clinical samples with forward primer Usu5454f (5′-ATGGATGAAGCYCATTTCAC-3′) (5) and a newly designed reverse primer 5861R (5′-CCAAAGTTGGCYCCCATCTC-3′). The primers were located in the conserved regions of the NS3 sequences of Bagaza virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Usutu virus (3–5) and were predicted to produce an ≈400-bp amplicon. The reaction conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94°C; followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 47°C for 35 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a fi nal extension of 72°C for 10 min.

All 11 theca folliculus samples and the isolate were positive for fl avivirus by RT-PCR, which was confi rmed by amplicon sequencing. The 367-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641389) of part of the NS3 genomic region obtained from the isolate was 66%–77% identical to the corresponding sequence of viruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus groups. The amplicon sequences from the 11 theca folliculus samples shared 98%–100% identity with the YY5 isolate. PCR testing of another 52 samples from diseased ducks from the 4 provinces detected fl avivirus-specifi c RNA in 29 samples. Overall, 40 (63.5%) of 63 samples were positive for fl avivirus. Flavivirus-specifi c RNA was most frequently detected in theca folliculi, followed by intestinal mucosa, uterus, spleen, trachea, cloaca (swab), and liver (Table). Subsequently, the YY5 isolate was injected intramuscularly into nine 55-week-old Pekin ducks and ten 30-week-old Shaoxing ducks. At day 4 postinoculation, the pathologic changes were reproduced in these experimentally infected ducks. The fl avivirus RNA was detected by NS3- based RT-PCR, and the virus was again isolated from theca folliculi. To investigate the genetic relationship of the isolate with fl aviviruses, we obtained the genomic sequence of a 1,035-bp segment at the 3′ terminus of the NS5 gene (GenBank accession no. HQ641390) from strain YY5 by RT-PCR and primers FU1 and cFD3 as described (6). Phylogenetic analysis showed that YY5 was more closely related to TMUV than to other fl aviviruses (Figure 2). Comparative sequence analysis showed that YY5 was 87%–91% identical to different strains of TMUV; therefore, we classifi ed the fl avivirus isolated from ducks as a new genotype of TMUV, a mosquito-borne fl avivirus of the Ntaya virus group. Conclusions We have demonstrated the presence of a mosquito- borne fl avivirus in ducks. On the basis of criteria for species of the members of the genus Flavivirus (6) and phylogenetic analysis, we consider the isolate to belong to a new genotype of TMUV.

In particular, it was found in 14 (93.3%) of 15 theca folliculus samples, suggesting that reproductive tissues may be a major site for viral persistence, replication, or both. Experimental infections further confi rmed that TMUV can be reisolated from theca folliculi. These results suggested that TMUV may be the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis. Because TMUV belongs to the mosquito-borne virus cluster of fl aviviruses, mosquitoes might be involved in the spread of this virus. Detection of the virus in cloacal swab samples suggests probable horizontal transmission through ingestion or inhalation of feces-contaminated material. TMUV was originally isolated from mosquitoes of the genus Culex, but the disease associated with TMUV infection was not known. However, a chick-origin TMUV isolate, originally named Sitiawan virus, can cause encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chicks (8). In conclusion, this study shows that duck-origin TMUV is highly pathogenic for Pekin ducks, Cherry Valley Pekin ducks, and Shaoxing ducks.

We captured 161 rodents inside private residences, using Sherman traps, including 86 house mice (Mus musculus) and 75 black rats (Rattus rattus). Serum from each animal was assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using two vertebrate-specific flaviviruses (Apoi and Modoc viruses) and five mosquito-borne flaviviruses (dengue 2, dengue 4, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses). Sixty-one (37.9%) rodents had anti‐ bodies that neutralized at least one virus. Prevalences for flaviviruses were 64.0% and 15.1% for black rats and house mice, res‐ pectively. None of the PRNT90 titers exceeded 80, and often they were highest for Modoc virus. These data suggest that a subset of rodents had been infected with Modoc virus or a closely related flavivirus that was not included in the PRNT analysis. Key words: Flavivirus, Mexico, Modoc vi- rus, rodents, surveillance. Rodents often live in urban environments in proximity to humans, causing serious implications for public health (Meerburg et al. 2009). Many zoonotic viruses have rodents as reservoir hosts, and rodent-borne zoonotic viruses of particular concern in- clude those in the genera Hantavirus (e.g., Hantaan and Sin Nombre viruses), Arena- virus (e.g., Lassa virus), and Alphavirus (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus). Several human pathogens in the genus Flavivirus have rodents as reservoir hosts including tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe and Asia (Mansfield et al. 2009), Powassan virus in the northeastern US, Canada, and Russia (Ebel 2010), and Kyasa- nur Forest disease virus in Asia (Hol- brook 2012). There is limited information on the prev- alence of flaviviruses in rodents in Mexico despite the enormous burden that these viruses place on human health. Of particu- lar concern is dengue virus (DENV), which is distributed throughout Mexico and causes large outbreaks of dengue fever and life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever each year (Tapia-Conyer et al. 2012). Dengue virus is primarily main- tained in a primate-mosquito transmission cycle, but detection of DENV RNA in wild rodents, marsupials, and bats suggests that nonprimates may occasionally serve as reservoir hosts (de Thoisy et al. 2009). West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis en- cephalitis virus (SLEV) are also human pathogens that occur in Mexico (Farfan- Ale et al. 2006). Both are primarily main- tained in bird-mosquito transmission cycles although evidence suggests that some ro- dent species are competent reservoirs for WNV (Platt et al. 2008). We determined the prevalence of DENV, WNV, SLEV, and select other flaviviruses in small, peri- domestic rodents in Merida, the largest city on the Yucatan Peninsula. Rodents were trapped inside 20 houses in a 92-km2 area of Merida. Trapping was performed at each house for three consec- utive nights each month, October 2011– September 2012. Twelve traps were placed each night. Each house had a cement floor and roof, cement walls, a small backyard, potable water and electricity, and most had screened windows. All houses were within 100 m of vacant lots that contained a large amount of domestic trash or veg‐ etation. Rodents were captured using 168 DOI: 10.7589/2015-05-116 Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 52(1), 2016, pp. 168–172 # Wildlife Disease Association 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis mailto:carmachain@gmail.com Sherman traps (839323 cm, H. B. Sher- man Traps Inc., Tallahassee, Florida, USA) baited with oats and sunflower seeds. Trapping was performed with permission of the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (permit 31D8B- 01373/1305). Captured rodents were eu- thanized by CO2 inhalation and identified to species and sex using morphologic keys (Emmons 1990; Reid 2009). Blood was col- lected from each animal by cardiac punc- ture, dispensed into VacutainerH tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA), placed on wet ice, and trans- ported to the laboratory. Samples were microfuged and supernatants were collect- ed and stored at −80 C. Animals were han- dled in accordance to protocols approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. All animals appeared healthy at the time of capture. Sera were assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) following stan- dard protocols (Beaty et al. 1995). The PRNTs were performed using five mos- quito-borne flaviviruses: DENV-2 (strain NGC), DENV-4 (strain 241), SLEV (strain TBH-28), WNV (strain NY99-35261-11), and yellow fever virus (YFV; strain YF- 17D) as well as two rodent-associated flavi- viruses that have no known arthropod vec- tor (NKV): Modoc virus (MODV; strain M544) and Apoi virus (APOIV, strain origi- nal). Although YFV and APOIV are not known to occur in Mexico, they were in- cluded in the PRNTs to detect antibodies to unrecognized YFV- and APOIV-like viruses that may be circulating in the area. We selected an antigenically diverse group of flaviviruses to reduce the likelihood of flavivirus-specific antibodies remaining un‐ detected. We obtained DENV-2, DENV- 4, SLEV, andWNV from theWorld Health Organization Center for Arbovirus Refer- ence and Research at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado, US; YFV, MODV, and APOIV were obtained from the World Arbovirus Reference Collection at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Gal- veston, Texas, US. The PRNTs were per- formed in 6-well plates using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera were tested at a starting dilution of 1:20. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilutions yielding $90% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT90). We captured 161 rodents of two species; 86 housemice (Musmusculus) and 75 black rats (Rattus rattus). Thirteen (15%) house mice and 48 (64%) black rats were PRNT- positive for flavivirus. Sixty-one (37.9%) rodents had antibodies that neutralized at least one virus. The PRNT90 titers for the positive black rats were usually highest for MODV although no titers exceeded 80 (Ta- ble 1). Twenty-five rats had MODV PRNT90 titers of 20, eight had titers of 40, and two had titers of 80. The two rats with titers of 80 (R-35 and R-77) could be con- sidered seropositive for MODV because these titers are at least fourfold greater than that of the other viruses tested. How- ever, because a PRNT90 titer of 80 is not particularly high and because all other positive rats had antibodies to an undeter- mined flavivirus, these two animals were assigned the conservative diagnosis of “seropositive for MODV or a MODV-like virus” to avoid potential misdiagnosis. All of the positive house mice had antibodies to an undetermined flavivirus (Table 2). None of their PRNT90 titers exceeded 40. Our data indicate that flaviviruses are a cause of infection in two species of peri- domestic rodents in Merida. In most instances, the flavivirus(es) responsible for these infections were not identified. Most of the positive rodents were black rats and often their PRNT90 titers were highest for MODV. However, because all of the titers were relatively low, it is likely that these animals were infected with a MODV-like virus that was not included in the PRNTs. The etiologic agent could be Cowbone Ridge virus, Jutiapa virus (JUTV), Sal Vieja virus (SVV), or San Perlita virus (SPV). All of these are NKV flaviviruses that belong to the Modoc serogroup and are known to SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 169 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis occur in the Americas.

These viruses were not in- cluded in the PRNTs because they did not form distinct plaques in any of the cell lines that we tested (Vero, BHK-21, and LLM- CK2). Another explanation is that a subset of positive rats had been infected with MODV but high antibody titers were not generated because the virus replicates poor- ly in some species of rodents. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) experimentally infected with MODV produced low anti- body titers when analyzed by serum dilution neutralization tests; none had titers .40 (Davis and Hardy 1973). Flavivirus-neutral- izing antibody titers steadily decline over time, so another explanation is that some of the positive rats had been infected with MODV, but none of the infections were re- cent. As observed with the black rats, all of the positive house mice had low PRNT90 titers. None of the house mice had PRNT90 titers .40, and usually their titers were higher for the mosquito-borne flaviviruses than for the NKV flaviviruses. Explanations for these findings include: 1) a subset of pos- itive mice had been infected with one or more of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses in- cluded in the PRNTs, but none of the infec- tions were recent, 2) a subset of positive mice may have been exposed to another, perhaps unrecognized, mosquito-borne fla- vivirus that was not included in the PRNTs, and 3) the etiologic agent was not identified because some of the positive mice and rats had been exposed to more than one fla‐ vivirus. However, previous studies have demonstrated that rodents sequentially challenged with heterologous flaviviruses develop high antibody titers (Tesh et al. 2002). Anecdotal evidence suggests that MODV was a cause of aseptic meningitis in a young boy who had handled a sick mouse (Davis and Hardy 1973). Direct con- tact with virus-contaminated rodent urine could be a mechanism by which MODV (and potentially MODV-like viruses) are transmitted to humans. Experimental stud- ies have shown that MODV is chronically shed in urine of golden hamsters (Mesocri- cetus auratus) for several months (Adams et al. 2013). Modoc virus was also detected in urine of experimentally infected deer mice for up to 6 d (Davis et al. 1974). Other serologic investigations have pro- vided evidence of flavivirus exposure in small rodents. Antibodies to flaviviruses were detected by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 10 of 19 (53%) house mice, 17 of 41 (41%) deer TABLE 2.

Flavivirus-specific antibodies were detected by blocking ELISA in nine of 215 (4%) deer mice in Iowa in 2005–07 (Blitvich et al. 2009). Taken together, our data and previous studies indicate that the presence of antibodies to flaviviruses in small North American rodents is not un- common. With increasing urbanization and the continual emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens, it is likely that peridomestic rodents will have an increasingly important role in zoonotic disease transmission.

Unlike other ar- boviruses, wild mammals have no confirmed role in the cycle of dengue in the neotropics, although serologi- cal studies have suggested a possible secondary amplification cycle involving mammals other than nonhuman primates. In French Guiana, where all four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) are present, the disease is endemic with outbreak events. To determine whether wild mammals can be infected by DENV, ro- dents, marsupials, and bats were captured over several periods, from 2001 to 2007, at two sites. The first loca- tion is a secondary forest surrounded by an urban area where dengue is endemic. The second location is a for- est edge site where the disease has not yet emerged. A total of 10,000 trap-nights were performed and 616 mammals were captured. RNAs representing the four DENV serotypes were detected at both sites by reverse- transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the livers and/or sera of 92 mammals belonging to 14 out of 32 species distributed among all the orders investigated: Rodentia (33 positive/146 tested), Marsupialia (40/318), and Chiroptera (19/152). Sequence analyses of a portion of the capsid and premembrane junction revealed that mammal strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 had only 92.6%, 89%, 95%, and 95.8% identity, respectively, with strains circulating in the human population during the same periods. Regarding DENV-2, strains related (99% identity) to those responsible for an epidemic event in humans in French Guiana concur- rent to the capture sessions were also evidenced, suggesting that wild mammals in edge habitats can be in- fected by circulating human strains. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that neotropical wild mammals can be infected with dengue virus. The question of whether mammals maintain DENV in enzootic cycles and can play a role in its reemergence in human populations remains to be answered. Key Words: Dengue virus; wild mammals; South America; periurban areas. 157 Introduction DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) BELONGS to the Flaviviridae familyand has been responsible for major epidemics in the tropics since the 17th century (Gubler 2001). Its associated disease manifestations (dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome) are caused by four vi- ral serotypes designated DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 that are widespread in the tropics throughout the world with significant public health and economic impacts. Indeed, with respect to both morbidity and mortality, dengue is the arbovirus with the highest incidence in hu- mans (an estimated 80–100 million infections are reported each year), with exponentially increasing occurrence (Weaver and Barrett 2004) and expanding distribution (Solomon and Mallewa 2001). The extent of epidemic events has been increasing due to several factors: the increase in hu- man population densities and movements worldwide, 1Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana. 2Molecular Virology and Surveillance Laboratory, CDC Dengue Branch, San Juan, Puerto Rico. 3Laboratoire Population Environnement, UMR-151 Université de Provence-IRD, Université de Provence, Marseille, France. 4Association Kwata, Cayenne, French Guiana. 5Laboratoire de Paléontologie, Paléobiologie et Phylogénie, Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution, UMR 5554, Université de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France. 6Département de Rétrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Franceville, Gabon. 7Laboratoire de Virologie, Centre National de Référence des Arbovirus et Virus Influenza, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne cedex, French Guiana. 8Unidad de Investigación Medica en Immunologiá, Coordinación de Investigación, Instituto del Seguro Social, CMN Siglo XXI, Hospital de Pediatría, Mexico, D.F. 9Département de Virologie, Institut de Médecine Tropicale du Service de Santé des Armées, Armées, France.

Up until now, factors regulating dengue outbreaks have mainly been related to the ecology of vec- tors, including seasonal variation of densities, relative abun- dance of infective females, daily survival rates (Kuno 1997), immune status of human hosts (Halstead 2007), and possi- bly their genetic background (Rico-Hesse 2003). Unlike most of the other arboviruses, dengue virus pos- sesses a unique human-to-human cycle, without the need for an intermediary wild mammalian reservoir (Rodhain 1991, Monath 1994). In Africa, Asia, and possibly in the Philip- pines, the virus nevertheless has, together with the human urban cycle, a sylvatic cycle, most likely involving nonhu- man primates as reservoirs (Fagbami et al. 1977, Inoue et al. 2003). Serological investigations in mammals suggest that the circulation of dengue follows epidemiological patterns, with- out detectable clinical signs in hosts (Saluzzo et al. 1986a, de Silva et al. 1999). The oscillating nature of cycles (Diallo et al. 2003) can suggest that herd immunity of nonhuman pri- mates and/or possibly other mammalian hosts regulates vi- ral amplifications, but so far, wild mammals have no dem- onstrated role in the dengue virus emergence processes in humans. Indeed, sylvatic dengue strains are genetically and ecologically distinct from urban ones. Nevertheless, though epidemic events are induced by nonsylvatic strains (Rico- Hesse 1990), sylvatic strains can induce characteristic febrile syndromes in West Africa (Carey et al. 1971, Saluzzo et al. 1986b) and limited epidemics in urban settings (Vasilakis et al. 2008). Sylvatic cycles have not been recognized in South America (Hayes et al. 1996, Scott 2001), in agreement with the supposed recent introduction of dengue in the New World due to hu- man population flows during the colonization and slave trade periods, a scheme supported by both genetic variability (Gaunt et al. 2001) and historical records (Christie 1881, Stead- man 1828). Two serological studies in remote forest Amerindian communities nevertheless led to divergent results with regard to the potential sylvatic circulation of DENV (Roberts et al. 1984, Valero et al. 2004). These discrepancies can be explained by virus divergence that may have led to technical difficulties in the detection of dengue viral infection by commonly used serological markers. Investigations on dengue sylvatic strains in wild mammals have also led to con- tradictory conclusions. Following the negative results ob- tained in serological investigations (Rosen 1958, Karesh et al. 1998, Contigiani et al. 2000), other works have shown indirect evidence of dengue virus infection in mammals. In Central America, antibodies that neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 were detected in 20% of tested bats, while in Ecuador 30% of bats had neutralizing antibodies for DENV-2 and/or DENV- 3 (Platt et al. 2000). In French Guiana, neutralizing antibodies for DENV-2 virus were also detected in the sera of rodents, bats, marsupials, ungulates, and xenarthres (de Thoisy et al. 2004). But, because these neutralizing titers were generally low, they could have been induced by other flaviviruses. Nev- ertheless, DENV is presumed to make its own antigenic com- plex within the Flaviviridae (Calisher et al. 1989). On the basis of these studies, a strictly sylvatic dengue circulation can therefore not be excluded. To resolve these questions, we investigated the presence of dengue virus in wild mammal fauna in areas of French Guiana, using molecular tools, where dengue is endemic, with outbreaks of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 reported since 1991. Only DENV-4 has been detected sporadically (Dussart et al. 2006). Two distinct sites were targeted. The first was near the city of Cayenne, where all four dengue serotypes circulate. There, we monitored fauna over a 6-year period, during and between dengue epidemics, to gain in- sights into the susceptibility of free-ranging mammals pres- ent close to human settlements to infection with DENV and the possibility that they can maintain a continuous trans- mission cycle in the wild. A second site was chosen in a rural location where DENV is practically absent. This area is un- dergoing rapid development, with the construction of roads and the establishment of new human settlements. It was thus of twofold interest. First, it would allow us to investigate po- tential occurrence of sylvatic circulation. Second, as dengue emergence events are expected to be related to environ- mental disturbances, a long-term study site would be valu- able to evaluate potential movements of DENV from humans to mammals and conversely. Materials and Methods Sites and trapping French Guiana is a French overseas department on the northeast coast of the South American continent, between Brazil and Suriname (4°N 53°W). Ninety percent of its sur- face area of 89,000 km2 FD is tropical rain forest; the re- maining 10%, situated in the northern part of the country, is coastal plain, where 90% of the 200,000 inhabitants live. The main urban center is Cayenne, with a total of 100,000 in- habitants. The diurnal temperature in the country varies from 28°C to 30°C. The dry season occurs from August to November with a short dry period in March (50 to 150 mm rain/month) and the rainy season lasts throughout the re- mainder of the year (200 to 600 mm rain/month). Animals (bats, terrestrial and arboreal rodents, and mar- supials) were captured at two different sites. The first, known as “le Camp du Tigre” (CT), is a secondary forest fragment of about 100 hectares located in a periurban area near Cayenne, where dengue is endemic. Seven trapping periods were implemented: in March 2001, and in the months of May (rainy season) and October (dry season) 2005, 2006, and 2007. The site is surrounded by urban areas and has a low diver- sity of mammalian fauna, including small monkeys (squir- rel monkeys, golden-handed tamarins), sloths, rodents, mar- supials, and bats. The second site, “Saint Georges de l’Oyapock” (SG), is located near the Brazilian border and has a low human population. This trapping site is located be- tween the edge of a primary forest and a rural area. Three trapping periods were carried out there in November 2006 and in June and November 2007. At each site, 20 to 30 trap stations were used to capture nonflying mammals. Each station included one Tomahawk trap (50 � 18 � 18 cm; Tomahawk Live Trap Co., Toma- hawk, WI) on the ground and 2 BTTm traps (33 � 11 � 10 cm; BTTm, Besançon Trap Service mécanique, France) or one BTTm and one Sherman trap (23 � 9 � 8 cm; Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, FL), with one trap being placed on the ground and the other in trees between 1 and 3 m in height. Traps were baited with apples and/or peanut butter for 15 to 21 consecutive nights and checked every morning.

A total of 418 mammals of the orders Rodentia and Marsupialia were captured at CT, and 46 were captured at SG (Table 1). In addition, 125 and 27 bats representing 14 species were captured at CT and SG, re- spectively, during the same periods on 2 to 4 consecutive nights using capture mistnets (12 � 2.40 m, 16-mm mesh; La- vorazione Reti, Monte Isola, BS Italy). Captured animals were brought back to the laboratory, identified using external morphological characteristics (Em- mons and Feer 1997), and their age and sex were determined. They were euthanized with pentobarbital (Dolethal©, Véto- quinol, Lure, France) after chemical anesthesia (ketamine 10 mg/kg � xylazine 1 mg/kg) under veterinary supervision. Blood and liver samples were collected aseptically and pre- served at �80°C for later use. Detection of dengue viral RNA in sera and liver samples by reverse-transcriptate polymerase chain reaction RNA was extracted from sera and liver tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, Refrewshire, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was re- verse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer oligonu- cleotides (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Promega, Madison, WI). Primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions were used following Lanciotti et al. (1992). cDNA (4 �L) was then used for the seminested PCR: During the first run of PCR, primers D1 and D2 were used to amplify a fragment of 511 bp corresponding to a portion of the capsid and premembrane (C/prM) genes. The second amplification run corresponds to a seminested PCR using primers D1 and TS1-TS2-TS3-TS4. Each of the last four primers is serotype specific, generating PCR products of different sizes (482 bp for DENV-1, 119 bp for DENV-2, 290 bp for DENV-3, and 392 bp for DENV-4). For each experiment and at every step, all the necessary controls were carried out to confirm that contamination did not occur. After serotype identification of positive animals, the first RT-PCR products were then used for another seminested PCR amplification using D1 and one of the newly designed primers to obtain longer amplification products (Table 2). The amplification was carried out as follows: an initial denatu- ration at 94°C for 5 min, then 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final incubation at 72°C for 10 min. The obtained PCR products were then di- rectly sequenced using the amplification primers. Sequenc- ing was carried out with an automatic sequence analyzer (ABI PRISM 3700, Applera, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DENV PCR products obtained from humans (CNR des Arbovirus et Virus Influenza, Insti- tut Pasteur de la Guyane) during contemporary periods were sequenced using the same primer pairs. Sequences were then aligned with other previously published sequences of dengue virus using MEGA software and alignments were checked manually. Database searches using the BLAST web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) were performed to identify the most closely related strains to those obtained from wild mammals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PAUP*4.0b8 (Swofford 1998). The MODELTEST 3.7 program (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to determine the optimal model of nucleotide evolution for the dataset, which was then applied for distance and maximum likelihood analyses. The resul- tant topology was examined by bootstrapping. One thou- sand iterations were performed for distance analyses and 100 replicates for maximum likelihood analyses. In addition, a Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1.0 (Ron- quist and Huelsenbeck 2003) to infer phylogenetic relation- ships. Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations were run for 1,000,000 generations, with six simultaneous chains, using a sample frequency of 100 and a burn-in of 100,000. Default settings for the prior probabilities of the model parameters (GTR��4) were used. Results Detection of dengue virus RNA in mammals A total of 569 livers and 560 sera collected from 616 cap- tured mammals were tested for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR. Dengue viral RNA representing the four serotypes was detected in samples from both collecting sites for a total of 92 mammals (Table 1). At the CT site, 16% (87/543) of the animals were infected; the distribution of DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 at this site was 41% (36/87), 20%, 33%, and 6% respectively. The distribution of DENV positive mammals by order was: Chiroptera 4% (19/543), Rodentia 5%, and Marsupialia 7%. At the SG site, only 7% (5/72) of the mammals, representing a single rodent species (Proechimys cuvieri) and trapped during a single session, were positive; they represented the DENV-3 serotype: 4% (3/72) and the DENV-4 serotype: 3% (2/72). Sequence analyses and phylogenetic investigations At least one C/prM sequence was obtained for each serotype from mammals collected in 2006 and 2007. These sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers EU518594–EU518605, EU522110, and EU642553. One sequence was obtained from DENV-1 RNA detected in one bat (Carollia perspicillata) captured in May 2007 at CT (accession number: EU518594). BLAST database searches of the obtained sequence revealed that the DENV-1 Mochizuki strain detected in Japan in 1943 is the most closely related strain with 97.3% identity (419 bp analyzed). Furthermore, the DENV-1 strain circulating in humans in French Guiana (EU518605) during the same period presents a lesser degree of identity (92.6%; Table 3). Phylogenetic analyses show that the major genotypes of DENV-1 (genotypes IV and V) are supported with high bootstrap values with the exception of genotype I (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic reconstruction confirms that the D1 C0558 bat French Guiana 2007 sequence is closely related to the Japanese DENV-1 Mochizuchi strain with high bootstrap values (80% in distance, 64% in maximum likelihood [ML], 76% in Bayesian analysis) and belongs to genotype I. In contrast, the DENV-1 strain identified in French Guiana in the human population at a contemporary period belongs to genotype V composed of American and Asian strains. Four sequences were obtained from DENV-2 RNA de- tected in four mammals captured in 2006 at CT. These se- quences reveal two distinct groups. The first two sequences (EU518601 and EU518602) were detected with DENV-2 RNA DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 159 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 4/ 09 /1 9.

BLAST database searches revealed that they share approximately 95% identity (390 bp analyzed) with a strain isolated in In- dia in 2001 (Table 3). Comparison with a human sequence obtained in French Guiana during the same period reveals approximately 89% identity (Table 2). The two other se- quences (EU518603 and EU518604) were obtained from DENV-2 RNA detected in two Marmosa murina (Marsupialia) and are most closely related to a sequence detected in the Dominican Republic in 2001 with which identities vary be- tween 99.2 and 99.7%. They are also closely related to the DENV human sequence obtained in French Guiana at the same period (98.7 and 99.2% similarity; Table 2). Phylogenetic analyses performed on these sequences with other representative strains enabled the five major DENV-2 lineages to be identified on the basis of consistent topologi- cal associations. Nevertheless, although the Asian, Ameri- can-Asian, American, and sylvatic lineages are supported with high bootstrap values, the cosmopolitan lineage is less supported and divided into two clades that are supported with high bootstrap values (Fig. 2). The DENV-2 sequences identified in mammals segregated into two distinct clusters. Two strains (D2 B1004 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D2 B1010 Marsupial French Guiana 2006) were related with high bootstrap values (81% in distance, 78% in ML, 100% in Bayesian analysis) to an urban strain circulating in French Guiana during the same period, and to strains identified in the Dominican Republic in 2001 (Fig. 2). These sequences are included in the American-Asian genotype that is well sup- ported (93% in distance, 96% in ML, 100% in Bayesian anal- ysis). The two other sequences (D2 B1015 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D2 B1032 Marsupial French Guiana 2006) are located at the base of the Native American lineage. This association is also well supported (87% in distance, 69% in ML, 98% in Bayesian analysis). Three sequences were obtained from DENV-3 RNA ex- tracted from three mammals: two in Marmosa murina (Mar- supialia) captured at CT in October 2006 and 2007 (EU518599 and EU518598, respectively) and one in Procchimys cuvieri (Rodentia) captured at SG in November 2006 (EU518600). These three sequences are closely related to each other and to a strain identified in Brazil in 2002 as well as to the H87 strain isolated in the Philippines in 1956. They show from 99.7 to 100% identity (on a 364 bp fragment) with these se- quences. Comparison of the three nucleotide sequences with the nucleotide sequence representing a human DENV-3 iso- lated in French Guiana during the same period shows ap- proximately 95% identity (Table 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that the three se- quences detected in mammals (D3 B1018 Marsupial French Guiana 2006, D3 C1034 Marsupial French Guiana 2007, and D3 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are related with high bootstrap values (99% in distance, 97% in ML, 100% in Bayesian analysis) to strains isolated in the Philippines in 1956, in China in 1980, and in Brazil in 2002. These sequences cluster together and belong to genotype V (Fig. 3). The hu- man strain circulating in French Guiana at a contemporary period belongs to genotype III composed of strains from Cen- tral and South America, Africa, Asia, and the West Indies (Fig. 3). Two sequences were obtained from DENV-4 RNA de- tected in a marsupial Didelphis marsupialis (EU518596) and a rodent Procchimys cuvieri (EU518595), which were trapped in 2006. The C/prM sequence is identical to a strain isolated in 2001 in Peru and is closely related to the H241 strain isolated in 1956 in the Philippines (AY947539) with 99.5% identity (360 bp analyzed; Table 2). Finally, they share 95.8% iden- tity with a strain observed in French Guiana (EU522110) in 2005. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that the mam- malian strains (D4 B1008 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D4 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are associated with strains isolated in the Philippines in 1956 and 1995, in Peru (2001), and in Brazil (2006). This group of sequences belongs to genotype I, which is not well supported (Fig. 4). In con- trast, the only DENV-4 strain isolated in humans in French Guiana in 2005 belongs, together with other South Ameri- can and West Indian strains, to genotype II. Discussion In the New World, unlike in the Old World, the commonly held belief is that dengue infection is absent in the fauna. Af- ter recent evidences of positive seroneutralization in wild fauna, we identified viral RNA in many species of South American bats, rodents, and marsupials, and we provide the first C/prM sequences of strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 circulating in animal communities. These results were found repeatedly both in an endemic area where all four serotypes circulate in the adjacent human pop- ulations (Fig. 5) and in an area where the disease is nearly DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 161 TABLE 2.

DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 163 FIG. 1. Phylogenetic Analysis of DENV-1 Isolates. The phylogenetic tree was derived from the partial nucleotide sequences of the C/prM genes (419 bp excluding primers) of representative strains belonging to the major lineages of DENV-1 (as designated by Goncalvez et al., 2002) using Distances, Maximum Likelihood (ML) (PAUP, version 4.10), and Bayesian analy- ses (1,000,000 replicates, MrBayes, version 3.1b). The following ML parameters corresponding to the TrN � G model were used: Nucleotide frequencies were estimated to be as follows: A � 0.3098, C � 0.1997, G � 0.2389, T � 0.2515. The –lnL value was 1816.49. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution was estimated to be 0.2005. The tree was rooted on the strains belonging to genotype IV. Support for nodes was provided by bootstrapping and the posterior probabilities of the corresponding clades (i.e. 1000 and 100 replicates under distances and ML (in normal and boldface type respectively) and under Bayesian analyses (in italics and underlined).

These findings suggest either spillover infections from humans to mammals or a possible enzootic cycle in- volving mammals. DENV sequences obtained from mam- mals led to the development of two plausible scenarios. First, on the basis of C/prM sequences, most of the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 strains obtained from wild mammals were divergent from those circulating in the surrounding human populations during the same periods. The strains identified in the wild mammalian fauna were found, at dif- ferent periods, in periurban areas and in forest areas, where human contacts are limited. This suggests that DENV in- fection of wild mammals and its circulation in mammal communities are widespread, which eliminates the possi- bility that our positive results could be related to inciden- tal, local, and/or time-restricted epiphenomena. Neverthe- less, some authors have already recorded such divergent strains and attributed t"

In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. BecauseWest Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argen- tina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV andWNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 out- break, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However, the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread abundance. For the same reasons, Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed to confirm these relationships.

In 2005, an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths [1]. SLEV has been considered a serious public health threat since 1933, when it was first discovered during a large human encephalitis outbreak that initiated in Missouri, USA [3]. In North America, SLEV is maintained through transmission between Culexmosquito vec- tors and certain passeriform and columbiform birds. In North America, House Sparrow (Pas- seridae; Passer domesticus) and House Finch (Fringillidae; Haemorhousmexicanus) are thought to be principal amplifiers of SLEV in urban locations, with Mourning Dove (Columbidae; Zenaidamacroura) also contributing in rural regions [3]. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. The virus has been isolated from humans (Buenos Aires Province), Culex spp. mosquitoes (Córdoba and Santa Fe provinces) and wild rodents (Córdoba) [4,5]. SLEV has never been isolated from birds in Argentina. How- ever, serological evidence indicates frequent infection of SLEV in Argentine birds [6]. In tem- perate and subtropical regions of Argentina, neutralizing antibodies were detected in a wide range of birds belonging to several families (Furnariidae, Columbidae, Tyrannidae, Fringillidae, Icteridae, Ardeidae and Cotingidae) [6]. In 2005, the first human encephalitis outbreak attributed to SLEV outside the USA took place in Córdoba Province in central Argentina [1], providing an opportunity to characterize the role of avian hosts in the ecology of SLEV in this locale. Because certain birds are the pri- mary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. Thus, we should detect a significant increase in viral activity in birds during an epidemic period compared to an enzootic period. To test this hypothesis, we compared avian SLEV sero- prevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epi- demic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (Flaviviridae; WNV) was also detected in Argentina in 2005 [7, 8], and is closely related to SLEV, all analyses were also con- ducted for WNV. Material and Methods Study area and collection sites Bird captures were carried out during summer and fall of 2004 and 2005 in 4 sites located in Córdoba city (31°24'30”S, 64°11'02”W) (Córdoba Province, Argentina) (Fig 1). This city of 1.3 million inhabitants is situated at 450 m above sea level, and encompasses an area of 576 km2 of which 37.2% is urbanized. The area belongs to the phytogeographic region called Espinal, Cha- queño Domain, or “Chaco Thorn-Forest” [9]. This region is characterized by semi-arid thorn scrub habitat but has been modified intensively by human activities (soy and fruit agriculture, cattle ranching, industrial activity). Isolated patches of natural habitat surrounding the city are comprised of shrub forest. The climate is temperate and semi-arid due to high evapotranspira- tion in spite of a relatively high precipitation level (750–800 mm) [10]. Four sampling sites were selected based upon accessibility, owners’ authorization and feasibility for mist net use; most of them are located in the periphery of the city of Córdoba (Fig 1): 1. Bajo Grande (BG) sewage treatment plant (31°23038@ S; 64°04036@W). The site is sur- rounded by aquatic vegetation, reservoirs, low income human settlements and crop lands (vegetables and fruits). Vegetation is dominated by non-native chinaberry (Melia azedar- ach) and white mulberry (Morus alba) deciduous trees alternating with grasslands.

Permission for sampling work in Bajo Grande and Botanical Garden were obtained from the Municipality of Córdoba. Private landowner permission was obtained for study sites at Camino San Carlos and Villa Gran Parque. Bird captures and sample collection Birds were captured with mist nets (AFOMist Nets, Manomet, Inc., Manomet, MA, USA). Four mist nets per site were installed and operated at dawn and late afternoon. The bird cap- ture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency. Captured birds were identified, weighed, sexed and aged when possible. Wild birds were marked with uniquely numbered aluminum leg bands. Before released, blood-sampled birds were rehydrated with sugar water. Whole blood was collected by jugular (most species) or brachial venipuncture (columbids). Birds that weighed less than 10 grams were not blood-sampled. Blood was placed into a centrifuge tube containing 0.45 mL or 0.9 mL (according to blood sample volume: 0.1 ml or 0.2 ml, respectively) of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) for an approximate 1:10 serum dilution, held at ambient temperature for 20–30 min for coagulation and placed into coolers. At the laboratory, samples were centrifuged at 5,000g for 15 min for separation of serum. Sera were stored at -20°C. Prior to analysis, sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C to inactivate non-specific inhibitors of virus neutralization. Ethics Statement The bird capture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency (586869- 053-107). Birds were handled following guidelines for the use of wild birds in research elabo- rated by the Ornithological Council (http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/ guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf). Field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. All blood sampling proce- dures were specifically approved as part of the obtaining field permit. Viral stocks preparation Low-passage SLEV CbaAr-4005 and WNV NY99-4132 strains were used for serologic assays. CbaAr-4005strain of SLEV was isolated from Culex quinquefasciatusmosquitoes collected in Córdoba during the human encephalitis outbreak of 2005 [5]. NY99-4132 strain of WNV was obtained from the brain of an American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) collected in New York during 1999. Viral stocks were obtained from infected Vero cell monolayers harvested on day 7 and 5 post-inoculation for SLEV and WNV, respectively. Serological assays and data interpretation Avian serum samples were screened for the presence of WNV- and SLEV-reactive antibodies by the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A suspension of approximately 100 pla- que-forming units (PFU) of virus in 75 μL of MEM was added to an equal volume of diluted avian serum, bringing the final serum dilution to 1:20. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Vero cell monolayers grown in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) were inoculated with 0.1 mL of the serum-virus mixture and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were overlaid with an initial 1 mL of 0.5% agarose in M-199 medium supplemented with 350 mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 29.2 mg/L L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin, SLEV andWNV Activity Patterns in Urban Birds, Argentina PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0161871 August 26, 2016 4 / 14 http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf streptomycin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B). After 3 and 6 days of incubation with WNV and SLEV, respectively, cultures were overlaid again with the same nutrient–agarose mix but also containing 0.004% neutral red for staining and visualization of viral plaques. Plaques were counted the following day. Serum samples that neutralized> 80% of the challenge virus (rela- tive to a serum-free control) were selected for further titration against both WNV and SLEV. Flavivirus titers of serum samples that tested positive in screen tests were determined as fol- lows. Seven serial two-fold dilutions of serum in MEM were prepared beginning with a dilution of 1:10. Virus mixtures were added as described above, resulting in final serum dilutions of 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1280. Endpoint titers were assigned as the reciprocal of the greatest dilution in which>80% neutralization of the challenge virus was achieved. Experiments that evaluated cross reaction among SLEV and WNV in heterologous inoculation scenarios in Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) indicated no cross reaction among SLEV and WNV (Contigiani MS personal communication).Based on this evidence, plus studies by Patiris et al. [11] and Ledermann et al. [12], we considered all serum samples with antibody titers higher than 20 positive. Therefore samples with titers higher than 20 for both viruses were con- sidered as multiple heterologous infections. Statistical analysis Infection prevalence with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for both viruses. Infection proportions within the year and month of sampling were compared using the Fisher exact test or Pearson chi-square test. P-values were considered significant at a threshold of α = 0.05. The homology between spatial activity for SLEV and the bird community was explored by means of a Procrustes analysis [13]. First, we selected a subset of 6 species that accounted for the majority of captures (51%) and 70% of SLEV seroprevalence, which included Eared Dove (Zenaida auri- culata), Picui Ground-Dove (Columbina picui), Rufous Hornero (Furnarius rufus), House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Great Kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus) and Bay-winged Cowbird (Agelaioides badius). These 6 species were represented in all sampled sites. Abundance and absolute prevalence matrix were built and data exploration showed the need to remove VP from the dataset (due to double zeros abundance). These frequency matrices were used to pro- duce unconstrained ordinations analysis with chi-square distance (community assemblage matrix) and Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (SLEV seroprevalence matrix). Finally, the ordination configuration homology was estimated by a Procrustes analysis and its statistical significance was calculated after 9999 permutations [13]. All analyses were run using vegan and core packages within the R platform [14,15,16]. In order to explore the effect of new species detected as infected on the overall avian sero- prevalence among the study periods, we compared the proportion of infected birds of the selected species (same subset as used for the spatial analysis) vs. the proportion of infected birds of the non-selected species, for a given period. Results A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV- and WNV-neutralizing antibodies. Analyzed sera belonged to 65 species and 27 families of free-ranging birds. SLEV seropreva- lence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005 (Table 1). Although the difference in sero- prevalence observed between years was significant (Fisher exact test, p<0.001), no significant difference was detected between months within each year (2004, χ2 = 1.51, df = 3, p = 0.68; 2005, χ2 = 0.44, df = 2, p = 0.80). During January-April 2004 only 3 birds tested positive for SLEV-neutralizing antibodies (0.7%). SLEV activity was found in 3 resident (i.e. non-migra- tory) bird species: Rufous Hornero (2.0%, 1/49), Bay-winged Cowbird (8.3%, 1/12) and Great SLEV andWNV Activity Patterns in Urban Birds, Argentina PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0161871 August 26, 2016 5 / 14 Kiskadee (1.2%, 1/80). These three seropositive individuals were distributed among three of the four study sites (Fig 1). One of these (Rufous Hornero) seroconverted from January to March (Table 2). Of 14 other recaptured birds in 2004, none seroconverted. In the second period (Jan- uary-March 2005), an overall SLEV seroprevalence of 7.7% (42/543) was registered, with sero- positive birds detected at all four study sites. Multiple infections for SLEV and WNV were detected in 6 serum samples (1.1%).Neutralizing antibody titer ranged from 40 to 1280, with titers of 40 and 160 the most frequently detected. SLEV seroprevalence increased between years in all three paired-year sites, showing significance differences between 2004 and 2005 (BG: χ2 = 136; p<0.001; CS: χ2 = 58; p = 0.01 and VP: χ2 = 56.35; p = 0.01) (Fig 1). Differences were also observed among sites within 2005 (χ2 = 24.53; df = 3; p = 0.006). In 2005, the number of SLEV-seropositive bird species increased from 3 in the previous year to 15 (Table 3). The avian families with the highest seroprevalence for SLEV-neutralizing anti- bodies were: Columbidae (14.0%; 14/101); Tyrannidae (10.1%; 14/138); Furnariidae (6.3%; 4/ 63); Thraupidae (5.5%; 2/36); Turdidae (4.5%; 1/22); Passeridae (3.9%; 2/51); and Icteridae (1.7%; 1/59). The seroprevalence by bird species ranged between 0% and 28.6%. Highest values were observed in Brown Cacholote (Pseudoseisura lophotes, 28.6%; 2/7) and Picui Ground- Dove (15.4%; 10/65). Two out of 25 recaptured birds seroconverted for SLEV during the Janu- ary-March 2005 period (Table 2). Bird community assemblage ordination showed pairwise overlapping (BG-CS, BG-BT) total inertia 0.62. Two first axes explained 78% of the variation (Fig 2A). Great Kiskadee is a common element in the BG-CS paired cluster. Picui Ground-Dove, Eared Dove and Bay- winged Cowbird/House Sparrow abundances are key species in the ordination of CS, BG and BT respectively. Rufous Hornero was common among all sites analyzed. Two convergent solu- tions were found after six iterations running NMDS analyses (stress: 0.1267; non-metric fit R2 = 0.9840; RMSE = 2.77−5). SLEV prevalence ordination shows a complete overlapping among analyzed sites suggesting a similar composition of infected bird species (Fig 2B). In site BG, infected individuals of all six selected species were detected. Infected Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) was only detected here. Sites BT and CS share the absence of infection in Shiny Cowbird, Eared Dove and Rufous Hornero (Fig 2A). Procrustes test was not signifi- cant (m2 = 0.7775; t0 = 0.4717; p-value = 0.3456) and failed to detect an association pattern between SLEV prevalence and bird abundance by sites. During 2005, whereas the SLEV seroprevalence among birds appeared to be relatively stable, with no significant change among sampling months, the number of infected bird species increased throughout the sampling period. Moreover, the relative importance of the 6 selected species used in the spatial analysis diminished from January to March as more species were Table 1.

The monthly infected bird species richness increased by 67% from January to March (Fig 3B). Only Picui Ground-Dove, Great Kiskadee and Eared Dove were detected as seropositive in all three months surveyed in 2005. Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee together contributed the largest number of infected individ- uals by month (approximately 50% of all seropositive birds each month). No WNV-neutralizing antibody was detected during January–April, 2004, among 437 bird sera analyzed. However, during January–March, 2005, the WNV seroprevalence observed was 1.5% (8/543, binomial 95% CI: 0.6–2.9%). Highest WNVseroprevalence was observed in March (2.3%; 95%CI = 1.7% - 9.0%;5/125) compared to January (0.9%;95% CI = 0.2% - 4.8%; 1/114) and February (0.5%; 1/209; 95%CI = 0.1% - 2.7%).WNV seropositive birds were observed in BG (1.3%; 2/160; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.4%), BT (1.1%; 2/176; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.1%) and CS (2.0%; 3/151; 95%CI = 0.7% - 5.7%). Only four out of 52 bird species were positive for WNV-neutralizing antibodies: American Kestrel (Falco sparverius); Rufous Hornero; House Sparrow; and Great Kiskadee (Table 2). Four WNV seroconversion events were registered out of 25 opportunities in 2005, most of them in Rufous Hornero (Table 3). Discussion Arbovirus activity is influenced in a complex manner by several biological and environmental factors [17]. As in North America, it appears thatcertain birds play an important role in the amplification of SLEV during outbreaks of human disease. Our study indicated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host popula- tion was primed to amplify SLEV. Another biologic factor that may have promoted the SLEV outbreak could be the sustained increase in abundance of the main vector Culex quinquefascia- tus which has been documented elsewhere [18,19]. In temperate areas, arbovirus transmission is highly influenced by mosquito vector abundance [20,21]. In urban sites of central Argentina, SLEV is mainly transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus [22] and potentially also by Culex inter- for [5]. These mosquitoes’ populations have two annual peaks: a small one in late spring-early summer (November-December) and a large one in late summer-early fall (February-March) [18,19]. Based on this vector pattern one would expect the presence of two peaks of SLEV activ- ity, which indeed was observed during this human encephalitis outbreak [1]. The high avian SLEV seroprevalence detected in January, followed by no discernable increase in antibody Table 3.

Some transmission continued in birds after January as evidenced by two serocon- version events (Table 3) and an expanding number of seropositive bird species (Fig 3B). The apparent reduction in avian seroprevalence for SLEV inMarch 2005 can be explained in several ways: 1. By March, conditions for SLEV amplification among birds were no longer favor- able, and the detectable seroprevalence dropped as a consequence of normal bird movements (emi- gration of seropositive individuals and immigration of seronegative individuals from regions where SLEV was not active); 2. Diminishing detectability of SLEV antibodies as birds aged and their anti- bodies, derived from infections several months earlier, began to wane to undetectable levels. SLEV antibodies in some birds infected during December to January could become undetectable in March due to diminishing neutralizing antibody titers below the detection threshold (20) [23,24]. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments (urbanized neighborhoods as well as patches of native habitat) throughout the city of Córdoba, indicating that ecological requirements for its maintenance are present. However, variation in the force of viral transmission among sites was observed. The highest activity was registered in the eastern peri-urban site (BG). This area contains large polluted water reservoirs and trash dumps, which support an abundant population of Culex quinquefasciatus. These landscape elements agree with those associated with risk of human infection identified by Vergara Cid et al. [25]. Differences in transmission among sites would be due to fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts. Infected bird species found during the SLEV epidemic period belong to the same families (Columbidae, Furnariidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidae) as those detected during enzootic periods further north in Argentina [6]. Presumably, a strain of SLEV would utilize similar vector and vertebrate host species for its maintenance/amplification throughout its geographic range. Hence, spatiotemporal variation in transmission would result from differing ecological features such as vector and vertebrate host abundance and distribution, habitat use and population dynamics. Within the epidemic period, we observed an increase in the number of SLEV- infected bird species between months (Fig 3). Whether this was due to a change in transmission ecology (i.e. a shift of transmission to novel amplifier hosts) or spillover to tangential avian hosts remains unknown. However, infected individuals of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kis- kadee were reliably present at all sampling sites. Multivariate analysis used in the geospatial analyses compared the bird species composition and SLEV seroprevalence among the study sites, but failed to detect a clear separation pattern. In our study, avian community assemblage varied among sites (Fig 2A) yet SLEV seropreva- lence ordination overlapped with all sites. The overlapping pattern observed in SLEV seroprev- alence could be explained by the presence of identical/similar mosquito vector(s) with similar host preferences. Such was the case for WNV in the eastern USA where viral activity is driven by mosquito host preference [26]. Although WNV and SLEV share ecological requirements, this hypothesis must be corroborated for SLEV. Eared Dove and Picui Ground-Dove (Columbidae), Great Kiskadee (Tyrannidae) and Brown Cacholote (Furnariidae) had high seroprevalence (>12%), are widely dispersed and are abundant in several ecosystems (urban and rural habitats). Moreover, seropositive individuals of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee were frequently detected during the epidemic Fig 2.

Dupuis-2003-Serologic evidence of West Nile vi.pdf	"Dispatches.qxd Serologic Evidence of West Nile Virus Transmission, Jamaica, West Indies Alan P. Dupuis II,* Peter P. Marra,† and Laura D. Kramer* In spring 2002, an intensive avian serosurvey was ini- tiated in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. We collected >1,600 specimens from resident and nonresident neotropi- cal migratory birds before their northerly migrations. Plaque reduction neutralization test results indicated specific neu- tralizing antibodies to West Nile virus in 11 resident species from Jamaica. West Nile virus (WNV) is maintained in naturebetween birds and Culex species mosquitoes (1,2). Unlike other viruses maintained in bird and mosquito transmission cycles (for example, St. Louis encephalitis, western equine encephalomyelitis, and eastern equine encephalomyelitis), the WNV strain responsible for the current epizootic in the Western Hemisphere is associated with a high number of avian deaths (3). Although crows and other corvids appear to be especially susceptible to disease (4), WNV has been documented in >190 bird species, including neotropical migratory species and exot- ic zoo specimens (5). Birds have been implicated in spreading WNV during migratory events in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East (6–9). Because of the apparent ease of infecting a multitude of avian hosts, WNV can potentially be intro- duced during annual migratory events in the Western Hemisphere. Predicting the incursion of WNV into the tropics is complicated by our incomplete knowledge regarding geographic connectivity in populations of migratory birds between winter and summer. We do not know where most species of migratory birds from North America spend their winter, where wintering birds spend their summer, or the routes they use while in transit. Evidence from mark-and-recapture efforts suggests that birds from the northeastern United States tend to winter in the southeastern United States and Greater Antilles (e.g., Puerto Rico, Jamaica) whereas birds from the western United States migrate to Mexico and Central America (10–12). In response to the potential introduction of WNV in tropical America during the fall migrations, we estab- lished a network of monitoring sites on the overwintering grounds of neotropical migratory birds in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. The Study The primary goal of the monitoring system was to obtain a large number of blood specimens from birds belonging to as many species as possible across the Caribbean. At seven study sites in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, we erected 15 mist nets (12-m) daily for 3 to 4 weeks during January through March 2002. We collected 1,619 avian blood specimens, which represented 98 species, 25 families, and eight orders. In Jamaica, 542 samples were collected from Westmoreland, Manchester, and St. Catherine Parishes; 649 samples were collected at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico; and 430 samples were collected from the states of Yucatan and Campeche in Mexico (Table 1). At the time of capture, all migratory birds were banded with an aluminum U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service band and 3–5 breast feathers were removed for isotope analysis. Resident birds had outer rectrices cut. All birds were eval- uated for age and gender if possible, bled with microcapil- lary tubes from the brachial vein, and released. Blood was added immediately to BA-1 medium, consisting of M199 medium with Hank’s salts, 1% bovine albumin, TRIS base (tris [hydroxymethyl] aminomethane), sodium bicarbon- ate, 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics. The samples were placed in a cooler on ice packs until storage in a –20°C freezer. Samples were sent on dry ice or hand- carried on ice packs to the Arbovirus Laboratories, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health for serologic analysis and virus isolation attempts. Specimens were screened at 1:100 for antibodies against flaviviruses by using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (13). Samples with a P/N ratio >2.0 were tested further by a plaque reduction neu- tralization test (PRNT) for Ilhéus virus (ILHV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and WNV, as described (14). The particular virus strains used for the PRNTs were ILHV (original), SLEV 59268 Parton, and WNV (3100365), an isolate from a pool of Culex sp. mosquitoes collected in Staten Island, New York. The indirect ELISA was chosen to screen the samples in order to take advantage of its abil- ity to detect antibodies against a wide range of flavivirus- es. PRNT was used as a confirmatory assay to differentiate among recognized flaviviruses (15,16). Briefly, serial dilu- tions of test samples were mixed with an equal amount of virus suspension containing 200 PFU/0.1 mL and incubat- ed at 37°C for 1 h. We then added 0.05 mL of each virus- 860 Emerging Infectious Diseases • Vol. 9, No. 7, July 2003 DISPATCHES *New York State Department of Health, Slingerlands, New York, USA; and †Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, Maryland, USA diluted blood sample onto 1 well of a 12-well tissue culture plate containing confluent monolayers of African green monkey kidney cells (Vero). The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C, after which an agarose overlay was added and incubation was continued. When virus plaques became visible, we added a second overlay containing neutral red and counted plaques. The antibody titer reported is the dilution of serum that inhibited 90% of the test virus inocu- lum. For virus isolation attempts using confluent Vero cell monolayers, 0.1 mL of each serum specimen was added onto one well of a six-well tissue culture plate, incubated for 1 h, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the cells were refed with minimum essential medium contain- ing 2% FBS. Cells were monitored once a day for 5 days for cytopathic effect. Cell cultures showing any abnormal cell morphology were then blind passaged after 5 days. ELISA results indicated 34 of 1,413 serum specimens tested from the three study sites contained immunoglobu- lin G antibody against a flavivirus. Of the 34 reactive sam- ples representing 20 bird species, 27 were collected in Jamaica (26 residents, 1 migrant), 5 in Puerto Rico (3 res- idents, 2 migrants), and 2 in Mexico (1 resident, 1 migrant). PRNTs on the Jamaican bird samples indicated 18 WNV infections, 3 SLEV infections, 5 undetermined flavivirus infections (positive results for two or more viruses without a fourfold difference in antibody titer); one additional reactive serum sample was negative for the three viruses tested. Results on the serum samples collect- ed in Puerto Rico indicated one WNV infection in a migra- tory bird and one SLEV infection in a resident bird; three additional reactive serum samples were negative for all three viruses tested. In Mexico, we found evidence of WNV infection in one migrant bird and SLEV infection in one resident bird (Table 2). Virus isolation attempts were negative for all 1,603 specimens tested (16 samples destroyed). Negative isolation results were not entirely unexpected, considering that birds are viremic for a short period of time (17) and maintaining a proper cold chain (i.e., temperatures) to preserve virus is difficult when working in the tropics. Conclusions We detected neutralizing antibodies to WNV in resident birds from two parishes in Jamaica. This detection marks the earliest evidence of WNV introduction into the neotropics; WNV antibodies have been demonstrated in birds and horses in Mexico (late 2002, spring 2003) (18,19) and detected in resident birds from the Dominican Republic (spring 2003) (20). This evidence of WNV in the neotropics may be an important development in the spread of the virus. The tropics provide all the necessary compo- nents (i.e., high temperatures, dense avian populations, and large numbers of Culex sp. mosquitoes) to maintain an enzootic focus. Furthermore, the climates of Mexico and the Caribbean are suitable for year-round transmission of the virus. No dead birds have been reported in Jamaica, but surveillance activity there is less intensive than in the United States; the study sites, being rural in nature, are not conducive to observing dead birds. Another contributing factor to the lack of reports of dead birds may be the rapid decomposition of dead birds as a result of the heat, humid- ity, and detritivore foragers, such as ants. Arbovirus activity, particularly of flaviviruses, is well documented in the Caribbean and Mexico. Dengue and yellow fever viruses are recurring public health threats in these areas. SLEV is endemic to Mexico and has been iso- lated from mosquitoes and one Northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) nestling in Jamaica (21). This disease is still active in the region, and its known range may have expanded into Puerto Rico, considering the one seroposi- tive Caribbean elaenia (Elaenia martinica) sampled during this study, although the antibody may have resulted from infection with yet another flavivirus. Neutralizing antibod- ies to WNV in migratory birds collected in Mexico and Puerto Rico, coupled with the apparent absence of anti- body to WNV in the resident bird population, indicate that Emerging Infectious Diseases • Vol. 9, No. 7, July 2003 861 DISPATCHES Table 1.

The results from this study suggest that WNV now appears to be established in Jamaica, on the basis of the neutralizing antibodies to WNV found in the resident bird population.

Previous studies have shown that TBEV exhibits pronounced genetic variability, which is often correlated to the geographical origin of TBEV. Genetic variability of TBEV has previously been studied predominantly in rodents and ticks, while information about the variability in patients is scarce. In order to understand the molecular relationships of TBEV between natural hosts, vectors and humans, as well as correlation between phylogenetic and geographical clustering, sequences of TBEV E and NS5 protein genes, were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from TBE-confirmed patients as well as from rodents and ticks collected from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia. A total of 27 partial E protein gene sequences representing 15 human, 4 rodent and 8 tick samples and 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences representing 17 human, 5 rodent and 8 tick samples were obtained. The complete genome sequence of TBEV strain Ljubljana I was simultaneously obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the E and NS5 protein gene sequences revealed a high degree of TBEV variability in patients, ticks and rodents. Furthermore, an evident correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering was shown that was independent of the TBEV host. Moreover, we show the presence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient sample, which was supported with multiple recombination event detection methods. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed the genetic relationships of directly sequenced TBEV samples from patients, ticks and rodents and provides the largest set of patient-derived TBEV sequences up to date. In addition, we have confirmed the geographical clustering of TBEV sequences in Slovenia and have provided evidence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome, obtained from a patient.

TBEV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [1]. TBEV genome comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb, which encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural and seven non-structural proteins [2]. Phylogenetic analyses of TBEV isolates identified three TBEV subtypes: European (TBEV-Eu), Far Eastern (TBEV-Fe) and Siberian (TBEV-Sib) [3]. TBEV is transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks. Primary vector of the TBEV-Eu subtype strains is Ixodes ricinus. TBE is maintained in the ecosystem between tick and vertebrate hosts. The most important vertebrate reservoirs in Europe are rodents. Rodents serve as both maintaining and amplifying hosts [1]. Although TBEV viral load is often low or undetectable, they play an important role in the circulation of the virus in nature as they enable co-feeding of infected and uninfected ticks [4]. In TBE-endemic areas the virus is distributed patchily in geographically limited areas, known as TBE-foci [1,5]. Within such foci, several genetic variants of TBEV have been identified [6–12]. Furthermore, several studies have identified geographical clustering of specific TBEV variants within small geographic areas [6–8]. Gaumann et al. for example performed phylogenetic analysis of 71 TBEV found in I. ricinus in Switzerland and identified 10 phylogenetic clades of closely related TBEV, some of which showed regional clustering [6]. Furthermore, Weidmann et al. have also identified the presence of several viral variants in ticks in Czech Republic and Germany. Their analysis also showed regional clustering of TBEV variants and a correlation between the genetic and geographic distances of TBEV isolates. They were thereby able to determine the direction of spread of TBEV in Central Europe in a westerly direction [7]. These studies were focused on determination of genetic variability of TBEV in rodents and ticks, but little is known about genetic variability of TBEV in patients in endemic areas. While the incidence of disease has been shown to be correlated with the regional prevalence of TBEV in ticks and rodents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48420 [8,13,14] limited information is available on the relatedness of TBEV strains among different hosts in endemic areas. Durmiši et al. [8] have shown for example that TBEV is genetically related in ticks and patients in Slovenia. The aim of our study was to expand the knowledge about the genetic relatedness of TBEV in rodents, ticks and patients in Slovenia. Furthermore, we aim to determine the overall genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia and assess if there is a correlation between phylogenetic and geographic clustering of TBEV variants in Slovenia in all three hosts. While previous studies were focused on molecular determination of virus isolates, direct sequencing of RT-PCR products was employed in our study in order to avoid the occurrence of genetic variation due to virus culturing or cloning. Thereby we were able to obtain a more realistic view of the genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia. We report the largest number of patient-derived TBEV sequences to date, and show that geographical clustering of TBEV variants is correlated to the phylogenetic clustering and is independent of the host. We also provide evidence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient. Results Complete genome sequence of TBEV strain Ljubljana I was determined and deposited in the GenBank database under accession number JQ654701. Genome organization analysis of the 11,092 bp long sequence revealed that it was identical to that of other members of the TBEV group. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain TBEV Ljubljana I belongs to the TBE-Eu subtype (Figure 1) and is most closely related to the Central European TBEV strains Salem and 263 both on the nucleotide level and the deduced amino acid level (divergence 2.0% and 0.6%). When TBEV strain Ljubljana I complete genome sequence was compared with 51 complete genomes of TBEV deposited in GenBank, a total of 7 unique amino acid substitutions were detected. A total of 27 partial E protein gene sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from clinical samples of TBE-confirmed patients, ticks and rodents: 15 from human samples, 8 from tick samples and 4 from rodent samples. A 757 bp long segment of the E protein gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 95.6 to 100% (divergence 0–4.4%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level ranged from 98.4–100% (divergence 0–1.6%). The most promi- nent amino acid change compared to the TBE-Eu reference strain Neudörfl was I167V, which was present in all Slovenian sequences. In addition, a larger part of the E protein gene (1164 bp) sequence was obtained from 20 samples. A total of 15 amino acid changes were detected compared to the reference Neudörfl strain. The most prominent amino acid changes compared to the Neudörfl strain were the same as observed in the 757 bp long segment. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1164 bp segment revealed that the 757 bp long segment was equally informative and therefore the 757 bp segment was used for further analyses. A total of 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences were obtained: 17 from human samples, 8 from tick samples and 5 from rodent samples. A 933 bp long segment of the NS5 protein gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. The identity of the determined TBEV NS5 gene nucleotide sequences ranged from 96.7 to 100% (divergence 0–3.3%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level ranged from 97.4–100% (divergence 0–2.6%). A total of 8 amino acid changes were detected compared to the Neudörfl strain. The most prominent amino acid changes were V51M and K108R which were present in all Slovenian sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the 757 bp TBEV E gene sequences revealed that sequences grouped in three major clades (A1–A3) and four additional minor clades (A4–A7), with high posterior probabilities (Figure 2). Phylogenetic clustering was independent of the TBEV host. Namely, TBEV sequences from ticks, rodents and patients clustered together. Similar results were obtained from the phylogenetic analysis of the 933 bp long TBEV NS5 protein gene sequences (Figure 3). Three major and four minor clades were formed (A1–A7). Sequences that clustered together in the E protein gene phylogenetic analysis also clustered together in the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. The only major exception was clustering of a TBEV sequence obtained from a patient sample H-49. While it clustered within clade A1 based on the E protein gene phylogenetic analysis, it clustered within clade A4 based on the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. Because the resulting branch swap could had occurred due to a recombination event, we addressed this question by analyzing concatenated E and NS5 protein gene sequences from samples where both were available (n = 22). Analysis revealed a putative recombination event in the E protein gene region of sample H-49 including two parental sequences H-51 (cluster A5) and H-61 (cluster A1). The recombination event was most strongly supported by the 3Seq algorithm (average p-value 9.10861024) and less with algorithms MaxChi (4.62361022), Chimaera (3.40461022) and SiScan (1.12961022). To assess potential correlation of sequence divergence to geographical locations, sample isolation locations were plotted on the map of Slovenia and colored according to their respective phylogenetic clustering based on E and NS5 protein gene sequence analysis (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4, a high level of regional clustering was present both after E and NS5 protein gene sequence analysis. Sequences from clades A1 and A3 were obtained from samples in the northern and central part of Slovenia while the sequences from clades A2 and A4 were obtained mostly from the southern part of Slovenia. Some level of regional clustering was observed also within clades A1, A3 and A2, A4: sequences from clade A1 being present even more to the north of Slovenia than the majority of sequences in clade A3 and sequences from clade A2 being present in the south-western part of Slovenia and sequences from clade A4 being present in the south-eastern part of Slovenia. As expected, the largest discordance was observed for the putatively recombinant sequence from sample H-49. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between genetic and geographic distances despite the evident correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering. Therefore, direction of spread of TBEV in Slovenia could not be determined. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the years of sampling and phylogenetic clustering. Discussion The aim of our study was to determine the genetic diversity of TBEV virus variants present in TBE endemic regions in Slovenia from human, tick and rodent samples. Nucleotide sequences were obtained by directly sequencing RT-PCR products from these samples in an attempt to avoid the occurrence of mutations that could arise in the process of virus culturing or cloning. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that employed direct determination of nucleotide sequences and simultaneous analysis of TBEV sequences from three TBEV hosts in one geographical area. We have shown that sequences from all three analyzed TBEV hosts cluster together. This observation is in concordance with the low mutation rate of TBEV and its conservative nature due to selective pressures implicated by the course of host Genetic Characterization of TBEV in Slovenia PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48420 switching. These results also imply that a limited number of genetic changes occur in the course of human infection. With respect to the quick course of disease and the low mutation rate of TBEV, these results are expected. Relatively high genetic variability of Slovenian TBEV was observed. Seven phylogenetic clades were determined both on the E and NS5 protein gene sequence analyses. Previous studies of genetic diversity of TBEV have also shown that multiple sequence variants are present in relatively small geographical areas. Genetic variability of the Slovenian TBEV variants is similar to those reported in previous studies (nucleotide sequence identity 96.1 to 100%) [6,7,10,15,16]. Our results also revealed that TBEV variants in Slovenia show correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering which is in concordance with previous reports [8]. Clustering was most evident for sequences in clades A1 and A3, which were obtained in the northern part of Slovenia and sequences in clades A2 and A4 which were present predominantly in the southern part of Slovenia. The observed distribution could be attributed to natural (levels of forestation) and human (freeways and larger cities) factors that prevent migration of hosts from the northern to the southern part of Slovenia and vice versa. In a recent study, Weidmann et al. [7] analyzed TBEV sequences from ticks in the Czech Republic and Germany, and have shown that TBEV was spread in the Central Europe from the east to west. Since in our study no correlation was observed between genetic and geographical distances we could not assess the direction of spread of TBEV in Slovenia. Namely, sequences from geograph- ically related clades did not exhibit higher genetic identities. This was most profoundly seen in the analysis of clades A1 and A3, which show greatest genetic divergence but originate from geographically close locations. These results could indicate that TBEV was introduced in Slovenia on multiple occasions. In order to confirm these findings a larger number of TBEV sequences from the eastern and western part of Slovenia should be included. Correlation between phylogenetic and geographical clustering was evident also on a smaller scale. Namely, ticks and rodents from the same or nearby isolation sites shared a high level of sequence identity, whereas ticks and rodent from different locations showed greater sequence divergence. A similar but not as evident trend was also seen in human samples. Of note, the phylogeographic analysis of the human samples included the locations of residency which do not necessarily correlate to the site of infection. In Slovenia nationwide travel is frequent due to the short distances and therefore it is not unlikely that patients with residence in one part of Slovenia got infected in other parts of Slovenia. On the other hand, despite the frequent migrations a geographically and phylogenetically well separated cluster of four patients in the south-eastern part of Slovenia was observed (clade A4), implying that this variant most likely also circulates in rodents and ticks in that area. Of note are also minor clades A5–A7 that were supported by the analysis of both E and NS5 protein gene sequences, which Figure 1.

In order to confirm this observation, further sampling of ticks and rodents in that area would be necessary. Analysis also revealed, that the phylogenetic clustering was not correlated to the year of sampling, therefore a temporal effect of the observed phylogenetic clustering was excluded. An interesting finding was the observed differential clustering of TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences obtained from a patient sample H-49. E protein gene phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering in clade A1, while the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis showed clustering in clade A4. Because, such phylogenetic jumps often arise due to recombination events, we tested this hypothesis with several recombination event detection methods. Analyses confirmed the possible recombination event between a virus from clade A4 and a virus from clade A1. Because rigorous contamination control measures were undertaken during this study, we believe that these results are most reliable. Reports on recombination in tick-borne viruses are scarce. To best our knowledge the only reported possible recombination event were detected by Uzcategui et al. [17] and Yun et al. [18]. Although no major recombination events were detected in these studies, several minor recombination events were discovered. In this view, our study gives the first evidence of possible recombination within different TBEV variants from patients. Because these results are Figure 3.

In conclusion, our study provides the largest set of patient- derived TBEV sequences and for the first time compares TBEV sequences from rodents, ticks and patients from one endemic area. All sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. Our results show that similar TBEV variants are present in all three hosts. Furthermore, our analysis revealed relatively high genetic variability of TBEV and evidence of geographical clustering of TBEV in Slovenia. In addition, we provide evidence of a possible recombination event in TBEV genome obtained from a patient. Materials and Methods Samples TBEV strain Ljubljana I isolated in 1992 from blood of a TBE patient was used for the completion of the whole genome sequence [19]. Low-level passage was used for the determination of the complete genome. Previously confirmed TBEV RNA-positive samples were selected from a collection of TBE-confirmed patient, tick and rodent samples stored at the Laboratory for Diagnosis of Zoonoses at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I. ricinus ticks were collected by flagging in TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia from 2005–2007 and were processed as described in [8]. Rodents were collected using live traps in years 2007–2008, from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia, and were processed as described in [13]. Human serum samples were collected from year 2000–2010 as a part of routine diagnostic testing. Since the study was retrospective, informed consent from the patients was not obtained. Instead, the research was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia. Also, the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, and the Slovene Code of Medical Deontology were followed in the conduct of this research. All human samples were anonymized and no additional sample was taken for the purpose of the study. Samples were stored at 280uC until further processing. Sampling locations of tick and rodent samples as well as locations of residency of patients are shown in Table 1. Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR Total RNA from human serum samples was extracted using TrizolH LS Reagent (Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from homogenized ticks or mice spleen was extracted using TrizolH Reagent (Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was stored at 220uC for up to a week or at 280uC for long term storage. TBEV Real-Time RT-PCR positive samples were included in this study. Real-Time RT-PCR was performed as previously described in [20]. Partial TBE E gene was amplified and sequenced using primer pairs TBE1082 and TBEc2022 [21] or TBE ENV 3F (59TGA GGG GAA GCC TTC AAT39) and TBE ENV 3R (59TCA TGT TCA GGC CCA ACC A39). Partial TBE NS5 gene was amplified and sequenced using primer pairs TBE7547 and TBEc8732 [21]. RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScriptH III One-Step RT-PCR System with PlatinumH Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Sequencing of PCR products Amplified PCR products were purified with the WizardH SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Cycle sequencing was performed using the BigDyeH Terminator 3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with the BigDyeH XTerminatorTM Purification kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with the 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosys- tems). DNA sequence analysis Nucleotide sequences were assembled and cropped to equal lengths using CLC Main Workbench software (CLC bio, Den- mark) and were aligned in MEGA version 5 [22] using Muscle algorithm. For the complete genome analysis of the TBEV Ljubljana I strain we included in the alignment 52 complete genome sequences of TBEV representing all three TBEV subtype groups available. Complete genome sequence of OMSK hemor- rhagic fever virus was used as an outgroup for the analysis. Accession numbers of all included sequences are presented in Figure 1. Nucleotide substitution model was selected based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) in jModelTest, version 0.1.1 [23]. The general time-reversible model with gamma-distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) was employed for all phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed in MrBayes 3.2 [24] and Tracer version Figure 4.

Three independent MCMC runs of four chains each consisting of 10,000,000 generations were run to ensure effective sample sizes (ESS) of at least 200. Maximum clade credibility trees were depicted using FigTree version 1.3.1 [25]. Recombination detection TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences (757 bp and 933 bp in length respectively) which were obtained from the same samples were concatenated in CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio, Den- mark). Concatenated sequences were aligned using Muscle algorithm in MEGA version 5 [22] and analyzed for putative recombination events using Rdp version 3.44 software (Heath L, et al 2006). An exploratory search was employed using methods RDP [26], GENECOV [27], Chimaera [28], MaxChi [29], BootScan [30], Siscan [31] and 3Seq [32].

This trend is accompanied by an in- crease in the total number of peripros- thetic joint infections, even though the overall percentage of this complica- tion is low (7). The most commonly isolated organisms in periprosthetic joint infections are gram-positive coc- ci, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis (8). In a retrospec- tive review, Moran et al. (9) examined the microbiological spectrum of 112 patients undergoing debridement and irrigation for a periprosthetic joint in- fection (hip [52], knee [51], elbow [4], ankle [3], shoulder [2]) at a tertiary care center in the United Kingdom during 1998–2003. The most frequent- ly isolated microorganisms were co- agulase-negative staphylococci (47%) followed by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (44%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (8%), aerobic gram-negative organisms (8%), and anaerobes (7%). Thirty-seven percent of patient speci- mens grew multiple microorganisms. We document the ability of B. extructa to cause an infection beyond its usual habitat, the oral flora. We hypothesize that the infection in this patient might have developed from hematogenous seeding in which an undiscovered and asymptomatic oral infectious nidus might have served as the seeding focus while mild trauma to the hip could have facilitated access to the joint space.

TBE virus (TBEV) types TBEV-Eur and TBEV- Sib occur in Estonia and Finland, along with 2 tick species, Ixodes persulcatus and I. ricinus. In Denmark, TBE has been reported since the 1950s only from the isolated Bornholm Island in the Baltic Sea with an incidence of ≈4 cases per 100,000 persons (2). Statisti- cal climate-matching models based on the known spatial distribution of TBEV indicate that the present North Zealand climate also would support TBEV- Eur transmission cycles (3). Recently (2008 and 2009), we reported TBE in 2 persons who had histories of tick-bite and originated from a single location in a small forest area (Tokkekøb Hegn) in North Zealand where TBE was previ- ously unrecognized (4). To determine whether TBE was established in this possibly new TBE focus in mainland Denmark outside Bornholm, we collected ticks by flag- ging (4) from 3 sites at Tokkekøb dur- ing June–July 2011. The 3 sites yielded 896 ticks (854 nymphs, 22 male adults, 20 female adults) in 24 pools. A fourth site at Grib Forest 10 km to the north yielded 198 ticks (183 nymphs, 9 male adult, 6 female adults) in 13 pools. Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 19, No. 7, July 2013 1171 LETTERS Flagging was repeated in September 2011 at Tokkekøb to confirm the pres- ence of TBEV and to obtain material suitable for virus isolation. Here, we ob- tained 7 pools (100 nymphs each) and 1 pool with adults (15 male, 15 female). In September 2011, we also obtained 13 pools (738 nymphs, 37 male adults, 41 female adults) at 3 suspected TBE loca- tions on Bornholm Island. In addition, 1,073 ticks in 58 pools were collected in 2010 and 2011 from deer inspected by the National Center for Wildlife Health from 54 various locations (Figure, panel A). All ticks were identified as I. ricinus on the basis of morphology. For TBEV-specific real-time PCR (5), ticks were homogenized in 0.5 mL nucleic acid extraction buffer and RNA/DNA extracted from 0.2 mL homogenate by using the MagNA Pure total NA kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Three of 37 pools (2 with nymphs, 1 with adult females) from Tokkekøb were TBEV RNA positive. None of 58 tick pools from other locations in Denmark or Bornholm were positive for TBEV but contained other pathogens (6). Five of the 8 pools obtained from the second flagging session (all nymphs) in Tok- kekøb were TBEV PCR positive, and 2 yielded isolates (T2, T3) in VeroB4 cell culture. Considering that the duration of the nymphal stage in I. ricinus is usu- ally only 1 or 2 years in northern Eu- rope (7), the repeated identification of TBEV in nymphs at the same location in 2009 and 2011 indicates establish- ment of a new focus of endemic TBEV in Denmark. Phylogenetic analysis of TBEV- E sequences (1,488 nt) of central Eu- ropean (8) and Scandinavian TBEV strains did not group the Zealand iso- late T2 (T3 was not sequenced) with the Bornholm strain but into a sub- clade with 2 isolates from Sweden, Torö-2003 (9) (GenBank accession no. DQ401140) and Saringe-2009 (GenBank accession no. KC469073); an isolate from Norway (GenBank ac- cession no. EF565947), and isolates from North Bohemia (Czech Repub- lic). The Bornholm strain located into a different subclade containing vari- ous sequences from South and Central Bohemia (Figure, panel B). TBEV se- quences from the Baltics and Finland locate to a spate clade. The missing link between the isolates from Born- holm and Zealand also was observed in a median joining network analysis (Splits Tree program, Epsilon1 [www. splitstree.org], 2,000 iterations [data not shown]). Two severe clinical cases of TBE connected to this new focus occurred in 2008–2009 (4). To search for ad- ditional missed clinical TBE cases from this area, we examined serum and cerbrospinal fluid of 96 patients (2007–2009) in whom encephalitis developed after tick bite; these sam- ples were found negative for Borrelia spp. by antibody ELISA and PCR (online Technical Appendix, wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/19/7/13-0092- Techapp1.pdf). To assess anti-TBEV seroprevalence, we also tested serum from 78 patients experiencing “sum- mer flu” who had histories of tick bite; this serum was submitted by general practitioners in North Zealand dur- ing July–November 2010 (online Technical Appendix). Except for 1 patient infected in Bornholm and 2 pa- tients infected in Sweden, none were 1172 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 19, No. 7, July 2013 Figure.

Since the 1980s, Sweden has experienced a 4-fold in- crease in human TBE incidence, with spread southwest (10). The emergence of the TBEV strain T2 closely related to isolates from Sweden may be a con- tinuation of this geographic trend. A previous antibody study found 3 deer positive for TBEV in Zealand-Falster (2); however, without convincing neutralization data, this finding is not confirmed. The lack of TBEV viremia and seropositivity among the patients in Zealand who had histories of tick bites supports a recent introduction to the new focus. Thus, 2 distinct intro- ductions of TBEV have occurred in Denmark. The underlining environ- mental or climatic factors driving this geographic trend remain unknown.

Recent cases of USUV infection in asymptomatic blood donors (3) and severe disease in immunocompromised persons (4) have shown its zoonotic potential. Epidemiology and molecular phylogeny of USUV isolated in Italy, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, and Germany suggest that stable endemic mosquito–bird cycles have been established in Europe (5,6). Where active vector surveillance programs exist, USUV is detected in mosquitoes before bird deaths and human infections. USUV strains similar to African strains were detected in mosquitoes in Spain in 2006 and 2009 (7,8). In November 2012, two live song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) with central nervous system signs were recovered from a die-off of ≈10 birds at a hunting estate in southern Spain. A full necropsy was conducted on the 2 thrushes (which died shortly after capture), and samples were collected for virus detection and histopathologic examination. Total RNA was extracted from oral and cloacal swab specimens, from serum from a cardiac blood clot, and from heart, kidney, spleen, and brain tissues by using High Pure RNA Tissue Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) and analyzed by generic flavivirus SYBR Green (QIAGEN, Madrid, Spain) real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and by a generic conventional nested flavivirus RT-PCR (9). The product of the first PCR (1,048 bp) was resin purified, cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, WI, USA), and sequenced. "
fulltext367.pdf	"ORIGINAL ARTICLES AAEM INTRODUCTION Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a zoonotic infection endemic to Eastern and Central Europe and Russia, caused by a tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In European countries, TBE is regarded as one of the most important and potentially fatal human infections of the central nerv- ous system, causing annually thousands of cases. TBE presents as meningitis in about 50% of patients, as menin- goencephalitis in 40%, and as meningoencephalomyelitis in 10% [5, 7, 9, 15, 20, 23, 24, 25]. TBEV is mainly transmitted to humans by tick bites, but alimentary infections due to consumption of raw (unpasteur- ized) milk occur in certain regions [7, 9, 19, 23]. According to published reports, these infections are primarily due to con- sumption of goat milk and/or cheese [1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 22], less commonly to consumption of sheep and cow milk and/or cheese [6, 12, 13, 14, 22, 26, 27]. According to Kriz et al. [12], out of a total of 7,288 TBE cases reported in the years 1997–2008 in the Czech Republic, 64 cases (0.9%) were food-borne, due to consumption of raw milk or cheese. In Slovakia, Labuda et al. [13] reported during 5 years 33 cases of TBE food-borne infections after drinking raw milk, which accounted for circa 9% of the total cases. The risk of infection with TBEV by milk consumption was assessed hitherto by serological examinations of ani- mals suspected to be a source of milk-borne infections in humans [2, 21, 26, 27]. To the best of our knowledge, no epidemiological examinations of milk samples taken from milk-giving animals in endemic areas have been carried PREVALENCE OF TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS (TBEV) IN SAMPLES OF RAW MILK TAKEN RANDOMLY FROM COWS, GOATS AND SHEEP IN EASTERN POLAND Ewa Cisak 1, Angelina Wójcik-Fatla 1, Violetta Zając 1, Jacek Sroka 1, 2, Alicja Buczek 3, Jacek Dutkiewicz 1 1 Unit of Zoonotic Diseases, Institute of Agricultural Medicine, Lublin, Poland 2 Department of Parasitology, National Veterinary Research Institute, Puławy, Poland 3 Chair of Department of Biology and Parasitology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland Cisak E, Wójcik-Fatla A, Zając V, Sroka J, Buczek A, Dutkiewicz J: Prevalence of tick- -borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in samples of raw milk taken randomly from cows, goats and sheep in eastern Poland. Ann Agric Environ Med 2010, 17, 283–286. Abstract: A total of 119 unpasteurized milk samples taken from 63 cows, 29 goats and 27 sheep bred on 8 farms situated on the territory of the Lublin province (eastern Poland), an area of risk of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), were examined for the presence of RNA of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) by the nested RT-PCR method. Milk samples were also tested for the presence of anti-TBEV antibodies by ELISA test. By RT-PCR, the greatest prevalence of TBE virus was found in the milk of sheep (22.2%), followed by milk of goats (20.7%) and cows (11.1%). By ELISA, the greatest prevalence of anti- TBEV antibodies was found also in the milk of sheep (14.8%), followed by milk of cows (3.2%) and goats (0%). The results suggest a potential risk of infection with TBEV by drinking raw milk on endemic areas of TBE, and indicate a need for milk pasteurization before consumption.

To fill this gap and to assess a real risk of human in- fection by drinking raw milk, we examined the randomly selected samples of unpasteurized milk for the presence of TBEV, using the RT-PCR method. The samples were taken from cows, sheep and goats living on TBE risk area in Lublin province (eastern Poland). MATERIALS AND METHODS Milk samples. A total of 119 milk samples were taken from 63 cows, 29 goats and 27 sheep bred on 8 farms situ- ated on the territory of the Lublin province (eastern Po- land). The samples were collected directly after milking into Falcon test tubes and processed according to Black- well et al. [4]. Milk fractions were prepared by centrifuga- tion of whole milk at 1,000 × g for 10 min. A syringe nee- dle was placed beneath the cream layer in the tube, and the skim milk then was drawn up by a syringe and transferred to another tube. Samples of skim milk were stored at -80°C before PCR and ELISA assays. RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted from the 200 µl volume of defatted milk, using Qiamp Viral Mini Kit (Qia- gen, USA) according to producer instruction. The amounts of extracted RNA measured with NanoDrop ND1000 spec- trophotometer (USA) were in the range of 19.8–47.8 ng/μl in each probe. The viral RNA was stored at -80°C until further analysis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). The RT-PCR reaction was performed using Quanti- Tect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to producer instruction. The kit procedure comprises two main steps: elimination of genomic DNA and reverse transcription. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a 20 µl reaction vol- ume which contained the following mix of reagents: gDNA Wipeout Buffer 7 ×, RNase-free water, Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, RT primer mix, Quantiscript RT Buffer 5 ×, and template RNA in a volume of 2 µl (from 40–98 ng). The reaction was performed in MJ Research Thermal Cycler (PTC-150, MJ Research Inc., Waltham, USA), under the following conditions: 2 min at 42°C for gDNA elimination, 30 min at 42°C and 3 min at 95°C for reverse transcription. First PCR reaction. The first PCR reaction was per- formed in the volume of 25 µl which contained the follow- ing mix of reagents: 1 × PCR buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.625 U of Ampli Taq polymerase (all from Qiagen, USA), 2 mM dNTP in a final concentration of 0.1 µM (Fermen- tas, ABO, Poland), primers Pp1: 5’-GCG TTT GCT TCG GAC AGC ATT AGC and Pm1: 5’-GCG TCT TCG TTG CGG TCT CTT TCG in a final concentration of 7.5 pmol each (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), nuclease-free water, and 1 µl of cDNA. The reaction was performed in MJ Re- search Thermal Cycler (PTC-150, an MJ Research Inc., Waltham, USA), under the following conditions: 2 min at 94°C for denaturation as the initial step, followed by 40 cycles of PCR, each of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 55°C and 1 min at 72°C. The final extension was performed in 5 min at 72°C. Positive control was obtained from the low patho- genic TBEV strain Langat (kindly provided by Dr. J. Süss, Friedrich Löffler Institute, Jena, Germany). RNase-free water was used as a negative control. Precautions to exclude contamination were as follows: One-use tips with filters (PCR-clean/dualfilter/sterile) and one-use Eppendorf test tubes (PCR-clean, free of detectable human DNA, DNase, RNase, PCR inhibitor) were used. The glass and plastic surfaces were treated with RNase Zap (Ambion, the RNA company, USA) which completely re- moves contamination with RNase. Nested PCR. The second amplification was carried out with 2 µl of the first amplification product diluted in nucle- ase-free water. The 50 µl of total reaction volume contained the following components: 1 × PCR buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 U of Ampli Taq polymerase (all from Qiagen, USA), 2 mM dNTP in final concentration of 0.1 µM (Fer- mentas, ABO, Poland), primers Pp2: 5’-TCG GAC AGC ATT AGC AGC GGT TGG and Pm2: 5’-TGC GGT CTC TTT CGA CAC TCG TCG in final concentration of 15 pmol each (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), and nuclease- free water. The reaction was performed in MJ Research Thermal Cycler (PTC-150, MJ Research Inc., Waltham, USA), under the same conditions as the first amplification, followed by 30 cycles. The PCR products were detected in UV light as ethid- ium bromide-stained 178-bp bands electrophoresed with a marker on 3% agarose gel. DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed with 30% of randomly selected positive samples with the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) using ABI Prism Big Dye Termina- tor v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits and Big Dye XTermina- tor Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems). The results were compared with published sequences in the GenBank data- base using the BLAST server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, Maryland, USA). ELISA test. The commercial test Immunozym FSME IgG All Species (Progen Biotechnik GMBH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for detection of the specific anti-TBEV antibodies in milk samples. Based on the paper by Bex et al. [3], the milk samples were diluted before testing with 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH = 7.4) in the ratio 1 : 1. Results were read spectrophotometrically at OD = 450 nm. RESULTS The results of the RT-PCR examination of milk samples for the presence of TBEV are presented in Table 1. The greatest prevalence of TBE virus was found in the milk of - - - - - Tick-borne encephalitis virus in milk samples 285 sheep (22.2%), followed by milk of goats (20.7%) and cows (11.1%). The sequence analysis of positive samples obtained from milk confirmed that the amplified products were iden- tical with the 96–100% homology with TBEV sequences; accession numbers are as follows: GQ266392 (TBEV strain AS33), FJ572210 (TBEV strain Salem), U39292 (TBEV strain Hypr), U27495 (TBEV strain Neudoerfl). By ELISA, the greatest prevalence of anti-TBEV anti- bodies was found also in the milk of sheep (14.8%), fol- lowed by milk of cows (3.2%) and goats (0%) (Tab. 2). The results obtained by ELISA were not correlated with those obtained by RT-PCR (χ2 = 0.25, p > 0.05). DISCUSSION The RT-PCR examination for the presence of TBEV in randomly selected raw milk samples collected on the risk-area of TBE in eastern Poland revealed a considerable prevalence of infection, mostly in sheep and goat milk. These results are noteworthy for public health, the more so as the hitherto published papers report the occurrence of TBEV in raw milk samples associated with clinical cases in humans, while the epidemiological examinations of ran- domly selected milk samples, with no links to human clini- cal cases, are lacking. The occurrence of TBEV in goat milk and/or cheese, as- sociated with clinical cases in humans, has been reported by numerous authors [1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 22]. A lesser numbers of authors have reported the occurrence of TBEV in milk and/or cheese from sheep [6, 12, 13, 27] and cows [12, 14, 22, 26]. Because of common consumption of cow milk, dem- onstrating of the presence of TBEV in over 10 percent of the raw cow milk samples is of particular epidemiological significance. In this respect, our results are in accord with those reported by Leonov et al. [14] and Vereta et al. [26] who described the significance of cow milk as the source of TBEV in Siberia. Leonov et al. [14] isolated TBEV from the milk of 1 cow out of 27 examined. The results of the examination of milk samples with ELISA test for the presence of specific anti-TBEV antibod- ies showed no correlation with those obtained by RT-PCR. This may suggest that the ELISA test is less appropriate for detecting the presence of TBEV in milk, compared to RT-PCR. In conclusion, our results indicate that the consumption of raw milk from sheep, goats and cows may be associated with risk of infection with TBEV. Thus, pasteurization of milk before consumption is strongly recommended [18], in particular in the localities where grazing goats, sheep and cows are exposed to tick bite.

Two major phylogenetic lineages were revealed: one included the YFV and Entebbe bat virus groups, and the other included the DENV, SPOV and Culex-borne flavivirus groups. This analysis supported previous evidence that Culex-borne flaviviruses have evolved from ancestral Aedes-borne viruses. However, the topology at the junction between these lineages remains complex and may be refined by the discovery of viruses related to the Kedougou virus. Additionally, viral evolution was found to be associated with the appearance of new biological characteristics; mutations that may modify the envelope protein structure were identified for seven viruses within the YFV group, and an expansion of host–vector range was identified in the two major evolutionary lineages, which in turn may facilitate the emergence of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. The genus Flavivirus includes 53 recognized species, many of which are human pathogens, and several other viruses yet to be documented as species. On the basis of phylogenetic evidence and taking into account their known vectors and natural vertebrate hosts, the species were divided into ecologically distinguishable groups that formed phylogenetically distinct lineages (Gaunt et al., 2001; Gould et al., 2003; Kuno et al., 1998; Billoir et al., 2000). The arthropod-borne flaviviruses are either tick- borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) composed of 12 species belonging to three different groups (Grard et al., 2007) that cause encephalitis (tick-borne encephalitis virus) or haemorrhagic fever (Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus), or mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) (27 species belong- ing to seven different groups; Thiel et al., 2005) that include human pathogens which cause haemorrhagic disease [yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus (DENV)] or encephalitis [West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus and others]. Among these arboviruses, a number are denoted as emerging viruses with a high potential for global dispersion as illustrated by the spread of WNV in North America following its inadvertent introduction into this area in 1999. The genus also encompasses viruses with no known vector (NKV) (Porterfield, 1980) that include mammalian viruses (12 species belonging to three different groups) for which arthropod vectors have not been identified. During the past decade, continuous efforts have been made to improve the understanding of the phylogenetic relationships, to pro- pose a reliable taxonomy and to develop molecular tools for diagnosis or viral surveillance. Complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences are now available for more than 30 flaviviruses species; however, except for the TBFVs (Grard et al., 2007), the exhaustive characterization of the NKVs and MBFVs still needs to be achieved. MBFVs are either mainly associated with Culex spp. mosquitoes [they are hereafter referred to as the ‘Culex group’ i.e. Japanese encephalitis, Aroa, Kokobera and Ntaya virus groups as defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)], or with Aedes spp. mosquitoes [‘Aedes group’ i.e. DENV, Spondweni virus (SPOV) and YFV groups as defined by The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are DQ859056–DQ859067. Two supplementary figures are available with the online version of this paper. Journal of General Virology (2010), 91, 87–94 DOI 10.1099/vir.0.014506-0 014506 G 2010 SGM Printed in Great Britain 87 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 18:40:02 the ICTV]. The phylogenetic lineage that encompasses Aedes-borne viruses also includes a clade of three viruses with NKV, isolated from bats, viz, Entebbe bat virus (ENTV), Yokose virus and Sokuluk virus (Gaunt et al., 2001; Kuno et al., 1998; Kuno & Chang, 2006; Tajima et al., 2005) that constitute the ENTV group. However, among the viruses that are vectored by mosquitoes, this biological association with Aedes spp. is not absolute since some viruses have been isolated from Culex or Phlebotomus spp. (Table 1). The current study focused on the Aedes group for which we report a comprehensive genetic characterization with complete ORF sequencing for 12 MBFVs corresponding to 10 species, including (Table 1): (i) species within the YFV group: Wesselsbron virus (WESSV), Banzi virus (BANV), Edge Hill virus (EHV), Jugra virus (JUGV), Saboya virus (SABV), Potiskum virus (POTV) (Saboya sp.), Sepik virus (SEPV), Uganda S virus (UGSV) and Bouboui virus (BOUV); (ii) species of the SPOV group: Zika (ZIKV) and Spondweni virus, previously recognized as Zika virus sp.; (iii) Kedougou virus (KEDV) currently included in the DENV group. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant medium of infected cell cultures (C6/36), and RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing were performed as previously reported (Grard et al., 2007). Briefly, the first set of RT-PCRs targeted the envelope, NS3 and NS5 genes with previously reported degenerate primers (Crochu et al., 2004; Gaunt & Gould, 2005; Moureau et al., 2007) and a new set of primers was used for the amplification of the NS3 gene (NS3FR: 59- TKICKICCIAYICKICCICKICKYTGIGCNGY-39; NS3FS:59- GGIGTIYTICAYACIATGTGGCAYGTIACN-39). Specific primers were deduced for gap filling by long range RT- PCR (cMaster RT plus PCR System kit; Eppendorf) and amplification products were sequenced using the Long PCR Product Sequencing procedure as described elsewhere (Emonet et al., 2007). The 39 termini of the ORFs were amplified using NS5-specific forward primer and the degenerate reverse primer 39UTR-MOS (59-GGTCT- CCWMTAACCTCTAG-39). The 59 termini of the ORFs were amplified using virus-specific reverse primer and a set of forward primers deduced from 59UTR alignment (sequences available on request). Final contiguous sequences were reconstructed using Sequencher 4.5 software (Gene Codes Corporation). A complete amino acid alignment was generated using K-align (Lassmann & Sonnhammer, 2005; available at the EMBL server - http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ kalign/index.html) and highly divergent regions were removed manually. This resulted in a final 2304 aa alignment. A maximum-likelihood (ML) tree (Fig. 1) was then inferred from this alignment using the WAG model of amino acid substitution implemented in the TREE-PUZZLE program (Strimmer & von Haeseler, 1996). In addition, ML analysis was conducted from the deduced NS5 gene alignment (827 aa positions) using the same parameters (Supplementary Fig. S2 available in JGV Online). Results of sequence analysis were combined with available ecological characteristics of viruses such as geographical dispersal, host–vector associations and pathology compiled from the CRORA viral database (Centre collaborateur OMS de Reference et de Recherche sur les Arbovirus, Institut Pasteur de Dakar; http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/ban- ques/CRORA/), the International Catalogue of Arboviruses (Karabatsos, 1985) and the relevant published scientific literature (Table 1). The global topology of the tree based on the complete amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) corresponds closely to those previously reported (Billoir et al., 2000; Cook & Holmes, 2006; Grard et al., 2007; Kuno & Chang, 2006; Medeiros et al., 2007), i.e. an ‘NS3-like’ topology. The earliest divergence assigns the TBFVs and two NKVs groups (the Modoc and Rio Bravo virus groups) to one branch, and the MBFV groups together with the third NKV group (the ENTV group) to a second branch. The MBFVs were further divided into two lineages, viruses associated with Aedes transmission being distributed to both lineages. The first one includes viruses belonging to the YFV group and viruses of the ENTV group. The second lineage includes the DENV group (Aedes group), a large number of viruses transmitted by Culex mosquitoes (Culex group), but also Aedes-borne viruses, which are genetically closely related to Culex-borne flaviviruses, i.e. the SPOV group and KEDV (Fig. 1), corresponding closely with earlier publications (Gould et al., 2003; Kuno et al., 1998). Analysis of amino acid alignments of viruses in the Aedes group showed that the polyprotein putative cleavage sites, enzymic motifs in the NS3 and NS5 genes and the sequence of the fusion peptide were highly conserved. Within the YFV group, seven viruses (EHV, BOUV, BANV, UGSV, JUGV, POTV and SABV) have a common ancestral root. Surprisingly, analysis of the conserved cysteines in the envelope (E) protein revealed that these viruses shared two major CAS mutations that abolished one of the six disulphide bridges, normally characteristic of the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein. Supplementary Fig. S1 (available in JGV Online) shows an alignment of E protein sequences and the position where these mutations occurred, i.e. cysteines C-60 and -121 (DENV2 envelope amino acid sequence numbering). These residues are usually paired to form one of the three disulphide bridges (bond b on Supplementary Fig. S1) that forms part of the structure of the envelope domain II, which supports the fusion peptide. No compensatory mutation at other positions of the envelope gene could be identified. The five remaining disulphide bonds are defined by the following paired cysteines: 3–30 (bond a), 74–105 (bond c), 92–116 (bond d), 185–285 (bond e) and 302–333 (bond f). Other viruses with non-conserved cysteines in the E gene have been previously identified, but they are all ‘atypic’ flaviviruses: (i) the mammalian virus Tamana bat virus with the CAY mutation at position 121 that also abolishes the disulphide bond b, and (ii) the three mosquito viruses: Cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus and Culex flavivirus (Hoshino et al., 2007) where the two cysteines of the G. Grard and others 88 Journal of General Virology 91 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 18:40:02 disulphide bond a are missing. Such mutations may be associated with significant modifications of the envelope conformation, and therefore may have an influence on viral entry into cells and/or the antigenic properties of the E protein. Finally, by combining the phylogenetic relationships with the ecological characteristics (Table 1) we have extended the knowledge of the original host–vector associations for these seven viruses. Their vertebrate hosts include mon- keys, rodents, antelope (BOUV), wallabies (EHV), and also birds (UGS) and bats (JUGV). BOUV, EHV and UGSV are mainly (but not exclusively) associated with Aedes spp. mosquitoes. SABV transmission is clearly associated with Phlebotomus spp. (Ba et al., 1999; Fontenille et al., 1994; Traore-Lamizana et al., 2001) and BANV transmission is associated with Culex spp. (McIntosh, 1984a). The latter virus is the only one of this group for which human cases have been reported. Hence, this lineage is characterized by an increasing diversity of arthropod vectors, which may in turn facilitate the infection of a greater number of possible vertebrate hosts, including humans. Taking into account the phylogenetic relationships, the ecological characteristics and the specific properties of the envelope protein, we propose that EHV, BOUV, BANV, UGSV, JUGV, POTV and SABV should be incorporated into a new taxonomic group, designated, the ‘Edge Hill virus’ group, which is distinct from the YFV group. Although EHV is found in Australia, the lineages most closely related to EHV are found in Africa. As pointed out by Gould et al. (2003), among the eight MBFVs species most closely related to EHV (i.e. the monophyletic lineage including both the YFV and EHV groups) only SEPV and JUGV are found outside Africa. Hence, under the most parsimonious scenario, the geographical origin of the EHV group would be most likely assigned to Africa, EHV being secondarily exported to Australia. According to this taxonomic proposal and until many more viruses have been identified, the YFV group may be limited to YFV, SEPV and WESSV (Fig. 1). WESSV is a human and veterinary pathogen transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes in Africa and Asia. SEPV has been responsible for only one human case and one sheep infection in Australia. It has only rarely been isolated from arthropod vectors and has never been associated with Aedes spp. mosquitoes. The genetic distance between SEPV and WESSV (12 % aa p-distance) is in agreement with their taxonomic assignment to two different species. The second lineage of the MBFV group includes DENV in a basal position (although this is not strongly supported), followed by clustering of ZIKV, SPOV and KEDV and then viruses associated with Culex transmission. This branching pattern suggests that viruses transmitted by Culex spp. mosquitoes evolved from an ancestral lineage associated with Aedes spp. mosquitoes, as was previously suggested from the NS5 nucleotide sequence data (Gould et al., 2001, 2003). The complete ORF phylogeny also suggests two possible taxonomic reassessments. SPOV is currently recognized as a member of the species Zika virus. Both viruses circulate in Africa but ZIKV was also isolated in Asia and Oceania. They are transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes but ZIKV was presumably associated with primates (Wolfe et al., 2001; CRORA, 2005a) and can induce human epidemics (Lanciotti et al., 2008; ProMED- mail, 2007) whereas, SPOV was associated with sporadic human cases (Burke & Monath, 2001; McIntosh, 1984b; Wolfe et al., 1982; CRORA, 2005b) and despite serological evidence of infection of cattle, sheep and goats (Burke & Monath, 2001) its reservoir host remains unknown. SPOV and ZIKV differ by 25 % aa p-distance. By comparison, WESSV and SEPV, which are classified as two different species, differ by 12 % aa p-distance. Hence, it seems reasonable to propose the creation of the species Spondweni virus. The second taxonomic revision concerns KEDV, which is currently a member of the DENV group. In previously reported phylogenies based on the NS5 gene, KEDV was associated with the DENV lineages (Gaunt et al., 2001; Kuno et al., 1998) or in a basal position in the second lineage (Gould et al., 2001; Kuno & Chang, 2005). However, the phylogeny we inferred from the complete amino acid data suggested that KEDV is most closely related to the SPOV group, although this was not strongly supported (Fig. 1), and indeed, in the NS5 ML phylogeny (Supplementary Fig. S2) KEDV appeared to be separated from both the DENV and SPOV groups. An analysis of amino acid distances in the NS5 gene showed that, by comparison with ZIKV which is clearly related to Culex- borne flaviviruses, KEDV is similar to viruses of both the Culex group and the DENV group, again showing that its phylogenetic position is ambiguous (Fig. 2). It is therefore possible that KEDV belongs to a distinct group of viruses for which other members remain to be discovered. In addition KEDV circulates in Africa but its vertebrate host is unknown and to date only one human case has been reported (CRORA, 2005c). As previously suggested (Kuno & Chang, 2007) it seems appropriate to consider KEDV to be a distinct group from the DENV group. The phylogenetic relationships inferred here for the other members of the Aedes group are in agreement with their current taxonomic status. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the Culex-associated flaviviruses evolved from ancestral Aedes-associated viruses seems robustly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of complete amino acid sequences. However, the topology at the junction between both groups is complex and may be refined in the future by the full-length characterization of more Culex-associated viruses and possibly the discovery of new viruses related to SPOV, ZIKV or KEDV. Viral evolution in the mosquito-borne flavivirus group is associated with the appearance of a number of new biological characteristics: firstly, significant modifications of the envelope protein were identified in the EHV group, which may modify the folding of this protein. Secondly, viral evolution was associated with an enlargement of the Genomics and evolution of Aedes-borne flaviviruses http://vir.sgmjournals.org 89 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 18:40:02 Table 1.

This propensity to adapt to new arthropod vectors may prove to be a crucial point regarding the potential for emergence of mosquito-borne flaviviruses in the future. This is perhaps best exemplified by WNV, which has been isolated from more than 60 different mosquito species in North America (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/mosquitoSpecies. htm; accessed 21 April 2009), possibly partly explaining why this virus has been so successful in the New World. Moreover, mosquito-borne YFV, WNV and St. Louis encephalitis virus have all been isolated from ticks in the wild (Burke & Monath, 2001), maybe reflecting evolutionary remnants equivalent to those reported on the basis of studies of flavivirus untranslated regions (Gritsun & Gould, 2006). Human activities (travel, displacement of both human and mosquito populations, modification of ecosystems, defor- estation) and also climate change offer increasing possibil- ities for unanticipated ecological cycles and natural hosts, and thus for virus adaptation to mosquitoes that could enhance transmission success to humans.

Weaver1 1 Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, Center for Tropical Diseases, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America, 2 United States Naval Medical Research Unit, No. 2, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 3 National Dengue Control Program, Phnom Penh, Cambodia Abstract Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus distributed throughout much of Africa and Asia. Infection with the virus may cause acute febrile illness that clinically resembles dengue fever. A recent study indicated the existence of three geographically distinct viral lineages; however this analysis utilized only a single viral gene. Although ZIKV has been known to circulate in both Africa and Asia since at least the 1950s, little is known about the genetic relationships between geographically distinct virus strains. Moreover, the geographic origin of the strains responsible for the epidemic that occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, and a 2010 pediatric case in Cambodia, has not been determined. Methodology/Principal Findings: To elucidate the genetic relationships of geographically distinct ZIKV strains and the origin of the strains responsible for the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island and a 2010 Cambodian pediatric case of ZIKV infection, the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame of five isolates from Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal collected between 1947 and 2010 were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these and previously published ZIKV sequences revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African and Asian) and that the strain responsible for the Yap epidemic and the Cambodian case most likely originated in Southeast Asia. Examination of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments revealed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in some of the virus strains, which may correlate with the passage history of the virus. Conclusions/Significance: The basal position of the ZIKV strain isolated in Malaysia in 1966 suggests that the recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain from Southeast Asia. Because ZIKV infection in humans produces an illness clinically similar to dengue fever and many other tropical infectious diseases, it is likely greatly misdiagnosed and underreported.

Other mosquito- borne flaviviruses of public health importance include yellow fever, dengue, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile and Japanese enceph- alitis viruses. Although research efforts have focused on many of these viruses, other medically important members of the mosquito- borne flaviviruses, such as ZIKV, have received far less attention. Zika virus was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed in the Zika Forest near Lake Victoria, Uganda in April 1947; a second isolation from the mosquito Aedes africanus followed at the same site in January 1948 [2]. Since that time, sporadic isolations have been made from humans and a variety of mosquito species in both Africa and Asia, with studies of human and animal seroprevalence confirming this distribution (Table 1). Zika virus is most likely maintained in a sylvatic cycle involving non-human primates and mosquitoes [3,4], with cyclic epizootics in monkeys reported in Uganda [5,6,7,8]. In the sylvatic transmission cycle, humans likely serve as incidental hosts. However, in areas without non-human primates, humans probably serve as primary ampli- fication hosts and potentially as reservoir hosts if their viremia is sufficient in duration and magnitude [9]. Although it is thought that enzootic ZIKV is maintained primarily in a monkey/ mosquito transmission cycle, antibodies have been detected in numerous other animal species including water buffalo, elephants, goats, hippos, impala, kongoni, lions, sheep, rodents, wildebeest, and zebras [5,10]. www.plosntds.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1477 Human case reports of clinically diagnosed ZIKV infections include self-limiting acute febrile illnesses with fever, headache, myalgia and rash, similar to that caused by many other arboviruses found throughout the tropics [9,11,12,13,14,15]. This clinical picture could easily be mistaken for dengue (DEN) or chikungunya (CHIK) fevers, two common arboviral infections which both produce similar clinical presentations. The latter two infections are much more commonly diagnosed in tropical Africa and Asia than ZIKV. Clinical DENV and CHIKV infections are familiar to local clinicians and most diagnostic laboratories can detect them. In contrast, few physicians are aware of ZIKV and few laboratories test for clinical infection. Consequently, most ZIKV infections are probably missed or incorrectly diagnosed, as suggested by the high prevalence of ZIKV antibodies found in serosurveys of human populations in Africa and Asia (Table 1). A recent epidemic on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, and a pediatric case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia demonstrate that ZIKV is also capable of causing human disease and may be expanding its geographic distribution [9,15]. Zika virus, has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome approximately 11 kilobases in length [16]. The genome contains 59 and 39 untranslated regions flanking a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins: the capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) [16]. A previous genetic study using nucleotide sequences derived from the NS5 gene indicated three ZIKV lineages: East African (one strain examined), West African (three strains examined), and Asian (one strain examined) [17]. Although ZIKV circulates widely in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, little is known of the genetic relationships among isolates from these two geographic regions, which may have different vector/host transmission cycles. Furthermore, the geographic origin of the strain responsible for the epidemic on Yap Island epidemic and of the recent Cambodian case of ZIKV infection is unknown. To answer these questions, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the ORF of five ZIKV strains collected between 1947 and 2010 in Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal and constructed phylogenetic trees to assess their relationships. Methods Virus strains, RNA preparation, genomic amplification and sequencing The five strains sequenced in this study were obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Table 2). The viruses were passaged in cell culture and harvested following the observation of diffuse cytopathic effect. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The ORF of the five viruses were amplified using the Titan One Tube PT-PCR System (ROCHE, Mannheim, Germany) and primers designed against conserved sequences to produce overlapping genome segments using African and Asian ZIKV strains: MR 766 (Prototype, Uganda, 1947, GenBank accession number AY632535) and EC Yap (Yap Island, Micronesia, 2007, GenBank accession number EU545988). Purified DNA was then sequenced using the PCR primers and additional internal sequencing primers. The Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Foster City, CA, USA) and the Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer were used to sequence the amplicons. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses Nucleotide sequences derived from the five ZIKV strains were assembled and aligned with three other sequences of ZIKV and one sequence of Spondweni virus that were retrieved from GenBank using the Vector NTI Suite (Invitrogen, USA) (Table 2). The two GenBank sequences of the MR766 strain exhibited considerable nucleotide and amino acid variation; therefore we resequenced this strain (Table 2). Phylogenies were generated using neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) methods using the default settings implemented in the PHYLIP package [18]. The Spondweni virus strain SM-6 V-1 was used as the outgroup for all phylogenies, as Spondweni virus is the most closely related flavivirus (antigenically and genetically) to ZIKV [1,19,20,21,22]. Robustness of the phylogenies was evaluated by resampling with 1,000 bootstrap replicates and horizontal branches were scaled according to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Results Phlyogenetic analyses All three methods of phylogenetic inference (NJ, ML and MP) identified two major lineages (African and Asian) (Figure 1). The most recent common ancestor of MR 766 (Uganda, 1947) diverged first, followed by the divergence of the most recent common ancestor of the ArD 41519 (Senegal, 1984) and IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968) strains, the P6-740 strain (Malaysia, 1966), and lastly the EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007) and FS13025 (Cambodia, 2010) strains. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation among African and Asian strains Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequence composition, the African strains were the most divergent from the Asian strains, and strains from the same geographic regions were the least divergent (Africa and Asia) (Table 3). There were several deduced amino acid differences among the strains, which in turn correlated to geographic area of virus collection. Author Summary Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus found in both Africa and Asia. Human infection with the virus may result in a febrile illness similar to dengue fever and many other tropical infections found in these regions. Previously, little was known about the genetic relation- ships between ZIKV strains collected in Africa and those collected in Asia. In addition, the geographic origins of the strains responsible for the recent outbreak of human disease on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, and a human case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia were unknown. Our results indicate that there are two geographically distinct lineages of ZIKV (African and Asian). The virus has circulated in Southeast Asia for at least the past 50 years, whereupon it was introduced to Yap Island resulting in an epidemic of human disease in 2007, and in 2010 was the cause of a pediatric case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia. This study also highlights the danger of ZIKV introduction into new areas and the potential for future epidemics of human disease.

To investigate this discrepancy (Table 2), we sequenced an additional strain of MR 766 from the WRCEVA collection. The MR 766 sequence with accession number AY632535 [16], was ultimately chosen for use in our analyses due to its low passage history, nucleotide and amino acid similarity to the high passage MR 766 strain that we sequenced (0.4% nucleotide and 0.6% amino acid divergence), and its position closest to the root of the MR 766 lineage in a tree including all three sequences (not shown). Glycosylation site variation between African and Asian strains Deletions in a potential glycosylation site of several strains were observed following their alignment (Figure 2). A 4-codon deletion was observed beginning at amino acid position 153 of the E protein of the MR766 strain (GenBank accession number AY632535), a 6-codon deletion at position 156 of another MR 766 strain (GenBank accession number DQ859059), and a 6- codon deletion at position 156 of the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study. The MR 766 strain (Passage 147) sequenced here did not exhibit any deletions in the predicted amino acid sequence and provided evidence of passage-associated changes in potential glycosylation site(s). Discussion Origin and expansion of Zika virus Prior to this study, only two ZIKV strains had been genetically characterized [16,17,22]. Our phylogentic analyses with the inclusion of five newly sequenced strains revealed the existence of two major ZIKV lineages. Analyses showed the basal Table 2. Viruses used in this study.

Furthermore, results of the present study show that the FSS13025 (Cambodia, 2010), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966) and EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007) strains belong to the Asian lineage, suggesting a recent common ancestor. The clinical similarity of ZIKV infection to classical DEN fever and CHIK fever may be one reason why this disease has rarely been reported in Asia. During World War II, for example, DEN fever was a major medical problem among Allied and Japanese troops in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific [23]. At that time, there were no specific laboratory tests that could differentiate between the three diseases. In fact, CHIKV and ZIKV still had not been isolated. Consequently, cases of acute febrile illness were likely diagnosed clinically as DEN or possibly as scrub typhus or malaria, diseases that were known and frequently diagnosed among the many foreign military and civilian personnel present in the region at that time [23]. Carey has reviewed the historical confusion in differentiating DEN fever from CHIK fever [24]; but ZIKV infections have probably been misdiagnosed or not reported for some of the same reasons. Given the low level of nucleotide divergence among the ZIKV isolates here (#11.7%), conserved regions could be utilized for the development of diagnostic assays that will not only aid in detecting new ZIKV infections but to also differentiate them from other arbovirus infections. Our results strengthen previous epidemiologic evidence that the EC Yap strain originated in Southeast Asia [9,17]. This conclusion is further substantiated by the geographic proximity of Yap Island to known areas of ZIKV transmission (Indonesia and Malaysia). It has been reported that wind-blown mosquitoes can travel distances of several hundred kilometers over the open ocean [25,26]. However, due to the great distances involved, it seems likely that the virus was introduced as a result of travel or trade activities whereby either a viremic person, enzootic host species, and/or an infected and subsequently infective mosquito (adult or immature) was transported to the island as suggested by Duffey et al. [9]. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that no monkeys were present on Yap Island during the 2007 epidemic [9]. The phylogenetic results indicate that the Cambodian strain diverged from the Malaysian strain in the recent past. Therefore, the most recent common ancestor of the Cambodian strain has been circulating in Southeast Asia since at least the mid-1900’s. These data indicate that Cambodian strain was either recently introduced or that it has been circulating in the region and has remained undetected until 2010. Seroprevalence surveys might help to determine when ZIKV was introduced into Cambodia. Glycosylation sites Several of the ZIKV strains we analyzed exhibited the deletion of a potential N-linked glycosylation site that has been previously described in some ZIKV and West Nile virus strains [16,17]. It has been hypothesized that extensive mouse brain or cell culture passage could lead the deletion of the potential glycosylation site [27]. Therefore, it is important to note that several of the strains in our analyses had previously undergone mouse brain passages (MR 766, IbH 30656, and P6-740) (Table 2). Of these strains, two different sequences of the MR 766 strain(s) AY632535 and DQ859059 [16,22], and the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study had a deletion in the potential N-linked glycoslyation site. The high passage MR 766 strain that we sequenced, did not exhibit this deletion. These results provide strong evidence that passage history has influenced glycoslyation sites in the MR766 strain. Since all of the MR766 strains have undergone passage in mouse brains it is impossible to determine if the deletion was present in the original strain, as is also the case for the IbH 30656 strain. Further sequencing of geographically distinct, low passage strains that have not undergone mouse brain passage is needed to ultimately resolve whether this glycoslyation site polymorphism occurs in circulating strains or if it only reflects passage history. Limitations We had access to only a small number of ZIKV strains. However, these strains were broadly distributed over time and space, and the phylogenetic analyses were robust. Several of the ZIKV strains had been passaged intracranially in mice, and included two highly passaged strains, IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968, passage history: suckling mouse 21, Vero 1) and MR 766 (Uganda, 1947, passage history: suckling mouse 146, C6/36 # 1). It is likely that nucleotide/amino acid changes may have resulted from the passage history of the IbH 30656 strain, which may have slightly influenced the corresponding, terminal branch lengths in our tree but not its overall topology. Summary This investigation indicates that the Yap Island epidemic, which occurred in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, most likely resulted from the introduction of a Southeast Asian ZIKV strain(s) pointing to an expansion of the Asian ZIKV lineage. Although ZIKV has one of the earliest and best-documented widespread geographic distributions among arboviruses, many unanswered questions remain concerning its evolution, ecology and epidemi- ology. In Asia, evidence suggests that the primary mosquito vectors are Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus [13,28], though several ecologically or geographically distinct mosquito vectors may be responsible for the transmission and/or maintenance of ZIKV throughout Asia. As such, further studies are needed to determine the primary and secondary mosquito vectors responsible for ZIKV transmission throughout the Asian region. In addition, human seroprevalence studies throughout Asia may provide insight into the expansion of the Asian lineage and clues as to why certain geographical regions maybe more suitable for virus maintenance and transmission than others. Additional work is needed to better understand the clinical presentation, tropism and pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in humans. Finally, continued ZIKV isolations in currently affected regions coupled with active surveillance in presently naı̈ve areas will allow researchers to follow the possible geographic expansion of the virus and predict the potential emergence of ZIKV into uncharted territories.

Hayes-2009-Zika virus outside Africa.pdf	"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. In 2007 ZIKV caused an outbreak of relatively mild disease characterized by rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis on Yap Island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. This was the first time that ZIKV was detected outside of Africa and Asia. The history, transmission dynamics, virology, and clinical mani- festations of ZIKV disease are discussed, along with the possibility for diagnostic confusion between ZIKV illness and dengue. The emergence of ZIKV outside of its previ- ously known geographic range should prompt awareness of the potential for ZIKV to spread to other Pacific islands and the Americas. In April 2007, an outbreak of illness characterized by rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis was reported on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Serum samples from patients in the acute phase of illness contained RNA of Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus in the same family as yellow fe- ver, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. These findings show that ZIKV has spread outside its usual geographic range (1,2). Sixty years earlier, on April 18, 1947, fever developed in a rhesus monkey that had been placed in a cage on a tree platform in the Zika Forest of Uganda (3). The mon- key, Rhesus 766, was a sentinel animal in the Rockefeller Foundation’s program for research on jungle yellow fever. Two days later, Rhesus 766, still febrile, was brought to the Foundation’s laboratory at Entebbe and its serum was inoculated into mice. After 10 days all mice that were in- oculated intracerebrally were sick, and a filterable trans- missible agent, later named Zika virus, was isolated from the mouse brains. In early 1948, ZIKV was also isolated from Aedes africanus mosquitoes trapped in the same for- est (4). Serologic studies indicated that humans could also be infected (5). Transmission of ZIKV by artificially fed Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to mice and a monkey in a labora- tory was reported in 1956 (6). ZIKV was isolated from humans in Nigeria during studies conducted in 1968 and during 1971–1975; in 1 study, 40% of the persons tested had neutralizing antibody to ZIKV (7–9). Human isolates were obtained from febrile children 10 months, 2 years (2 cases), and 3 years of age, all without other clinical details described, and from a 10 year-old boy with fever, headache, and body pains (7,8). From 1951 through 1981, serologic evidence of human ZIKV infection was reported from other African coun- tries such as Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone (10), and Gabon, and in parts of Asia including India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia (10–14). In additional investiga- tions, the virus was isolated from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia, a human in Senegal, and mosquitoes in Côte d’Ivoire (15–17). In 1981 Olson et al. reported 7 people with serologic evidence of ZIKV illness in Indonesia (11). A subsequent serologic study indicated that 9/71 (13%) human volunteers in Lombok, Indonesia, had neutralizing antibody to ZIKV (18). The outbreak on Yap Island in 2007 shows that ZIKV illness has been detected outside of Africa and Asia (Figure 1). Dynamics of Transmission ZIKV has been isolated from Ae. africanus, Ae. api- coargenteus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. aegypti, Ae vitattus, and Ae. furcifer mosquitoes (9,15,17,19). Ae. hensilii was the predominant mosquito species present on Yap during the ZIKV disease outbreak in 2007, but investigators were unable to detect ZIKV in any mosquitoes on the island dur- ing the outbreak (2). Dick noted that Ae. africanus mosqui- toes, which were abundant and infected with ZIKV in the Zika Forest, were not likely to enter monkey cages such as Zika Virus Outside Africa Edward B. Hayes Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 1347 Author affiliation: Barcelona Centre for International Health Re- search, Barcelona, Spain DOI: 10.3201/eid1509.090442 SYNOPSIS the one containing Rhesus 766 (5) raising the doubt that the monkey might have acquired ZIKV from some other mosquito species or through some other mechanism. Dur- ing the studies of yellow fever in the Zika Forest, investiga- tors had to begin tethering monkeys in trees because caged monkeys did not acquire yellow fever virus when the virus was present in mosquitoes (5). Thus, despite finding ZIKV in Ae. Africanus mosquitoes, Dick was not sure whether or not these mosquitoes were actually the vector for enzootic ZIKV transmission to monkeys. Boorman and Porterfield subsequently demonstrated transmission of ZIKV to mice and monkeys by Ae. aegypti in a laboratory (6). Virus content in the mosquitoes was high on the day of artificial feeding, dropped to undetect- able levels through day 10 after feeding, had increased by day 15, and remained high from days 20 through 60 (6). Their study suggests that the extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in mosquitoes is ≈10 days. The authors cautioned that their results did not conclusively demonstrate that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV at lower levels of viremia than what might occur among host animals in natural settings. Nevertheless, their results, along with the viral isolations from wild mosquitoes and monkeys and the phylogenetic proximity of ZIKV to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, make it reasonable to conclude that ZIKV is transmitted through mosquito bites. There is to date no solid evidence of nonprimate res- ervoirs of ZIKV, but 1 study did find antibody to ZIKV in rodents (20). Further laboratory, field, and epidemiologic studies would be useful to better define vector competence for ZIKV, to determine if there are any other arthropod vectors or reservoir hosts, and to evaluate the possibil- ity of congenital infection or transmission through blood transfusion. Virology and Pathogenesis ZIKV is an RNA virus containing 10,794 nucleotides encoding 3,419 amino acids. It is closely related to Spond- weni virus; the 2 viruses are the only members of their clade within the mosquito-borne cluster of flaviviruses (Figure 2) (1,21,22). The next nearest relatives include Ilheus, Rocio, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses; yellow fever virus is the prototype of the family, which also includes dengue, Japa- nese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses (1,21). Studies in the Zika Forest suggested that ZIKV infection blunted the viremia caused by yellow fever virus in monkeys but did not block transmission of yellow fever virus (19,23). Information regarding pathogenesis of ZIKV is scarce but mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation then spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream (24). Although flaviviral replication is thought to occur in cellular cyto- plasm, 1 study suggested that ZIKV antigens could be found in infected cell nuclei (25). To date, infectious ZIKV has been detected in human blood as early as the day of illness onset; viral nucleic acid has been detected as late as 11 days after onset (1,26). The virus was isolated from the serum of a monkey 9 days after experimental inoculation (5). ZIKV is killed by potassium permanganate, ether, and temperatures >60°C, but it is not effectively neutralized with 10% ethanol (5). Clinical Manifestations The first well-documented report of human ZIKV dis- ease was in 1964 when Simpson described his own occu- pationally acquired ZIKV illness at age 28 (27). It began with mild headache. The next day, a maculopapular rash covered his face, neck, trunk, and upper arms, and spread to his palms and soles. Transient fever, malaise, and back pain developed. By the evening of the second day of illness he was afebrile, the rash was fading, and he felt better. By day three, he felt well and had only the rash, which disap- peared over the next 2 days. ZIKV was isolated from serum collected while he was febrile. In 1973, Filipe et al. reported laboratory-acquired ZIKV illness in a man with acute onset of fever, headache, and joint pain but no rash (26). ZIKV was isolated from serum collected on the first day of symptoms; the man’s illness resolved in ≈1 week. Of the 7 ZIKV case-patients in Indonesia described by Olson et al. all had fever, but they were detected by hospital-based surveillance for febrile illness (11). Other manifestations included anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and dizziness. One patient had conjunc- tivitis but none had rash. The outbreak on Yap Island was characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia (1,2). Other less frequent manifestations included myalgia, head- ache, retroorbital pain, edema, and vomiting (2). 1348 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 Figure 1.

Zika Virus Outside Africa Diagnosis Diagnostic tests for ZIKV infection include PCR tests on acute-phase serum samples, which detect viral RNA, and other tests to detect specific antibody against ZIKV in serum. An ELISA has been developed at the Arboviral Di- agnostic and Reference Laboratory of the Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) M to ZIKV (1). In the samples from Yap Island, cross-reactive results in sera from convales- cent-phase patients occurred more frequently among pa- tients with evidence of previous flavivirus infections than among those with apparent primary ZIKV infections (1,2). Cross-reactivity was more frequently noted with dengue vi- rus than with yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, or West Nile viruses, but there were too few samples tested to derive robust estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA. IgM was detect- able as early as 3 days after onset of illness in some per- sons; 1 person with evidence of previous flavivirus infec- tion had not developed IgM at day 5 but did have it by day 8 (1). Neutralizing antibody developed as early as 5 days after illness onset. The plaque reduction neutralization as- say generally has improved specificity over immunoassays, but may still yield cross-reactive results in secondary fla- vivirus infections. PCR tests can be conducted on samples obtained less than 10 days after illness onset; 1 patient from Yap Island still had detectable viral RNA on day 11 (1). In general, diagnostic testing for flavivirus infections should include an acute-phase serum sample collected as early as possible after onset of illness and a second sample collected 2 to 3 weeks after the first. Public Health Implications Because the virus has spread outside Africa and Asia, ZIKV should be considered an emerging pathogen. Fortu- nately, ZIKV illness to date has been mild and self-limited, but before West Nile virus caused large outbreaks of neuro- invasive disease in Romania and in North America, it was also considered to be a relatively innocuous pathogen (28). The discovery of ZIKV on the physically isolated commu- nity of Yap Island is testimony to the potential for travel or commerce to spread the virus across large distances. A medical volunteer who was on Yap Island during the ZIKV disease outbreak became ill and was likely viremic with ZIKV after her return to the United States (2). The com- petence of mosquitoes in the Americas for ZIKV is not known and this question should be addressed. Spread of ZIKV across the Pacific could be difficult to detect because of the cross-reactivity of diagnostic flavivirus antibody as- says. ZIKV disease could easily be confused with dengue and might contribute to illness during dengue outbreaks. Recognition of the spread of ZIKV and of the impact of ZIKV on human health will require collaboration between clinicians, public health officials, and high-quality refer- ence laboratories. Given that the epidemiology of ZIKV transmission on Yap Island appeared to be similar to that of dengue, strat- egies for prevention and control of ZIKV disease should include promoting the use of insect repellent and interven- tions to reduce the abundance of potential mosquito vec- tors. Officials responsible for public health surveillance in the Pacific region and the United States should be alert to the potential spread of ZIKV and keep in mind the possible diagnostic confusion between ZIKV illness and dengue.

Both howlers live syntopically in El Piñalito Provincial Park, Misiones, where four groups (36 individuals) were studied since January 2005. The first dead howlers were found on January 20, 2008, in El Piñalito. Systematic searches found 14 dead howlers within the area (12 from the study groups and two from neighboring groups), with only two young seen on January 25, 2008, and none found since up to December 2008. In October 2008, another YFO hit howler monkey populations from El Soberbio, Misiones. Overall, 59 howlers were found dead in Misiones from November 2007 to December 2008. Thanks to the alert of the howler’s death in El Piñalito, a prompt human vaccination campaign started in the area. Wild howler monkey populations from both species are in a delicate situation in Misiones, especially the brown howler, an already endangered species in Argentina and endemic to the Atlantic Forest. If we add the recurrence of YFOs to the reduction of suitable habitat to small fragments, it could be only a matter of time until howler populations disappear from the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest in Misiones. Am. J. Primatol. 72:475–480, 2010. r 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: disease; yellow fever outbreak; population decline; primate conservation INTRODUCTION Yellow fever, one of the most feared human diseases before the development of an effective vaccine, is caused by a flavivirus and transmitted by hematophagous mosquitoes [Aitken, 1988; King, 1977; Monath, 2001]. This African virus came to America during the slave trade, and still affects thousands of people in tropical Africa as well as Central and South America [Monath, 2001]. All Neotropical primates are susceptible to yellow fever [Ott-Joslin, 1986; Richter et al., 1984]. Probably because they evolved in the absence of the virus, New World monkeys are more vulnerable to the disease than are African primates [Ruch, 1959]. Infection in Ateles and Alouatta is almost always fatal [Ruch, 1959]. Other yellow fever outbreaks (YFOs) have been observed sporadically, affecting particularly Alouatta populations in Panama, Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago and Brazil [Bryant et al., 2003; Collias & Southwick, 1952; Elton, 1955; Ministerio de Salud e Instituto Nacional de Salud de Colombia, 2002; Viégas Sallis et al., 2003]. Two howler monkey species occur in Argentina: the black howler (Alouatta caraya) and the southern brown howler (Alouatta guariba clamitans). Black howlers inhabit the Chaco and Pantanal ecoregions in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and North-Northeastern Argentina [Rumiz, 1990], and a small portion of the Atlantic Forest in Misiones (Argentina) and the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil [Di Bitetti, 2003; Leiroz Codenotti et al., 2002].

E-mail: holzmanningrid@yahoo.com.ar rr 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. endemic to the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of Brazil and Argentina [da Silva, 1981; Kinzey, 1982] and are being threatened as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation (only 7.4% of the original Atlantic Forest is left; [Brown & Brown, 1992; Myers et al., 2000]), hunting pressure, and susceptibility to epi- demic diseases and parasites [Crockett, 1998]. In Argentina, the brown howler is an endangered species [Barquez et al., 2006] present only in the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest of Misiones province and little is known in regards to its current distribution and population status. In Misiones and areas of southern Brazil these two howler species’ distributions overlap in a relatively narrow zone of sympatry [Aguiar et al., 2007; Bicca-Marques et al., 2008; Di Bitetti et al., 1994; Gregorin, 2006]. In at least one protected area of Misiones, El Piñalito Provincial Park, both howler species live syntopically [Di Bitetti, 2003]. From January 2005 to January 2008, we carried out a study on the behavioral ecology of these two howler species in El Piñalito [Agostini et al., 2008]. Our regular monthly monitoring of howlers during this period allowed the detection of two YFOs between November 2007 and October 2008 that affected both species in Misiones, Argentina. Con- currently, these YFOs affected the same howler species populations in Brazil [Ministerio de Saúde do Brasil, 2008]. In Paraguay, yellow fever cases were confirmed for humans, but no official data on howler deaths were available for these YFOs [Min- isterio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social de Paraguay, 2008]. An outbreak has been defined as ‘‘the occur- rence of a disease in excess of what would be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extent over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years. A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak’’ [WHO, 2009]. In this article, we report the impact of recent YFOs on populations of black and brown howlers in Misiones, Argentina, estimate the minimum number of dead individuals, and discuss the implications of recurrent YFOs for the conservation of wild primate populations in Argentina. METHODS We obtained most information on wild howlers from our long-term study in El Piñalito Provincial Park (261300S, 531500W), where we monitored four groups of monkeys (two of each species) during three years. After we found the first four dead monkeys (on 20 January 2008), a team of 12 individuals, including biologists, park-rangers and veterinarians, intensively searched for monkeys in the area, especially within the home range of the study groups, for five days (between 24 and 31 January 2008) also trying to find monkeys carcasses fresh enough to determine the cause of death. We asked local residents for collaboration to search and report any dead monkey found in the area surrounding the park. On February 2, 2008, the same search procedure was carried out in Cruce Caballero Provincial Park (261310S, 531590W), a small protected area 30 km SW of El Piñalito, where a few groups of brown howlers are present [Di Bitetti et al., 1994]. Data on monkey mortality episodes from other localities of Argentina were gathered from reports of official sources and local residents. On January 26, 2008, wildlife veterinarians of the government of Misiones performed a necropsy on an adult brown howler female (Penélope), found at El Piñalito within 24 hr of her death. The samples taken from Penélope, as well as all the other cases reported in this article, were analyzed by the INEVH (Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Virales Humanas—Dr. Julio I, Maiztegui Institute, Pergamino, Buenos Aires, Argentina). The diagnosis of yellow fever was confirmed by isolation in cell cultures (Aedes albopictus C3/36), followed by direct immuno- fluorescence, RT-PCR generic for Flavivirus, and genome sequencing [INEVH, data not published]. We obtained data on rainfall and mean tem- peratures from meteorological stations located in Puerto Iguazú (251350S, 541 340W) and El Soberbio (271170S, 541 120W) for the 1999–2008 period. These data were used to explore whether the beginning of the YFOs could be associated with abnormal climatic conditions, as has been proposed [Vasconcelos et al., 2001]. All research reported in this manuscript adhered to the American Society of Primatologists Principles for the Ethical Treatment of Non-Human Primates, and all research protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Ecology of the province of Misiones, Argentina. Moreover, all research reported in this manuscript complied with the protocols approved by the appropriate institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and adhered to the legal requirements of Argentina, in which the work took place. RESULTS The temporal and geographical distributions of howler deaths reported in this study suggest the presence of two different YFOs: one occurring between November 2007 and April 2008 in northern and central Misiones, and another ocurring between October and December 2008 in southern and central Misiones (Fig. 1). Am. J. Primatol. 476 / Holzmann et al. In the spring of November 2007, 13 free-ranging black howlers died in the wildlife rehabilitation center ‘Güirá-Ogá’ (Puerto Iguazú, Misiones, 251370S,541320W; [A. Carvalho in litt., 2008], Fig. 1). This mortality event was not reported to the authorities and a confirmed diagnosis of yellow fever was obtained only after the findings of dead monkeys in El Piñalito led to the suspicion of yellow fever. Between 20 and 31 January 2008, we found 14 dead howlers (seven from each species) at El Piñalito (Fig. 1). Twelve of them belonged to our study groups, which originally consisted of 36 individuals [Agostini, 2009]. All dead howlers, except for Pené- lope, were in advanced decomposition, and we estimated that these monkeys died between 10 and 25 January 2008. The bodies were not randomly distributed within their home ranges, but usually in clumps of several individuals with the same degree of decomposition, frequently at the base of a sleeping or feeding area, which suggests that their deaths were highly synchronous. With the exception of a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old-male juveniles of one of the brown howler groups observed together alive on 25 January, 2008, no howler monkeys have been observed or heard at El Piñalito since, despite efforts to locate them up to December 2008. In the following six autumn–winter months, there were no further monkey mortality records in Misiones, until the spring of October 2008, when seven black howlers were found dead by a farmer at El Soberbio (271 080S, 541 090W, Fig. 1). All the dead monkeys were decomposed to a similar degree and dispersed within a range of 100 m, near a small river [J. Torresı́n in litt., 2008]. In November 2008, a park ranger found three dead black howlers in the Papel Misionero Reserve (261 250S, 541 220W, Fig. 1). In December 2008, at least nine black howlers were found dead in Garupá (271 310S, 551 520W, Fig. 1), 12 km from Posadas, the capital city of Misiones [INEVH in litt., 2009]. The presence of the yellow fever virus was confirmed by the INEVH from samples submitted from Güira Ogá, El Piñalito, El Soberbio and Garupá. Other sites seemed to have been unaffected. No dead monkeys were found in Cruce Caballero Provin- cial Park, located between areas with confirmed YF howler casualties. On February 2, 2008, one group of seven brown howlers was seen near the park ranger’s home. The same group was seen again on July 18, 2008 [A. Bodrati personal communication]. In total, 59 individuals of both howler species were found dead between November 2007 and December 2008 in Misiones. Taking into account that since the outbreak there have been no signs of howlers in El Piñalito, we also infer that all the individuals of the four groups under study (15 black howlers, 8 brown howlers and 1 putative hybrid [Agostini, 2009]) and many individuals from neigh- boring groups died during the mortality event in January 2008. The study and neighboring groups at El Piñalito were composed by adult males (5), adult females (10), subadult males (3), subadult females (3), juvenile males (6), juvenile females (5), infant males (4), infant female (1), and an infant putative hybrid (1). Since all presumably died during the YFO, we found no age–sex differences in suscept- ibility to the disease. Thus, we estimate a minimum of 83 casualties of both howler species in Misiones province. Six black howler monkeys were also found dead between October 2008 and February 2009 in the Argentine province of Corrientes, which borders Misiones to the South, and yellow fever was confirmed by the laboratory at least for one case [OPS, 2009]. No suspected deaths attributable to yellow fever were recorded for the other primate species widely distributed in Misiones, the tufted capuchin monkey (Cebus nigritus). A group of this species, composed of apparently healthy individuals, was observed at El Piñalito on 30 January 2008, when we were searching for howlers. At the beginning of 2008, immediately after the first four howler monkeys were found dead in El Piñalito, we alerted the National Health Author- ity of Argentina. To avoid the spread of the epidemic to human population, a prompt and massive vaccin- ation campaign was carried out in the area surround- ing El Piñalito and the forested border with Brazil. The weather in Puerto Iguazú and El Soberbio is, in general, very similar: rainfall since 1999 to 2008, show a positive and significant correlation (rs 5 0.6319, Po0.0001), so does the average mean temperature (rs 5 0.9133, Po0.001). We therefore, used only Puerto Iguazú records for comparison. For Fig. 1.

Am. J. Primatol. Yellow Fever Impact on Howler Monkeys / 477 months in which YFOs started (November 2007 and October 2008), rainfall was higher than the Puerto Iguazú averages from 1999 to 2008 for those same months (Fig. 2). Also, these high values of rainfall were associated with warm mean temperatures (over 201C). Rainfall in November 2007 was exceptionally high, however, for October 2008 rainfall was within the normal range of variation observed for this region. DISCUSSION In Argentina, 59 howler monkeys from two species, A. g. clamitans and A. caraya, were found dead within Misiones and another six A. caraya died nearby, in the province of Corrientes, during two YFOs that occurred in the spring–summer of 2007–2008 and again in the following spring– summer of 2008–2009. Only two previous YFOs have been reported in Argentina. In 1966 (20 February–10 March), three brown howlers were found dead in Misiones and several yellow fever cases were reported in humans at that time [Crespo, 1974]. In 2001 (March–May), 80 brown howlers died of yellow fever near the Brazil–Argentina border [Viégas Sallis, 2003]. No dead capuchin monkeys were found, most likely because these monkeys are more resistant to the yellow fever virus, usually only developing clinical signs such as fever, but seldom dying [Strode, 1951]. On the other hand, howlers are highly susceptible, and even when inoculated with low quantities of the virus they rapidly develop the disease and die [Strode, 1951]. Howler monkeys act as sentinels for public health: their mass mortalities caused by their high susceptibility to yellow fever warn human populations of the presence of the disease [Butcher, 1991]. Species that maintain specific endemic patho- gens are little affected by the disease they carry [e.g. Hazel et al., 2000]. In howler monkeys, yellow fever occurs in the form of epidemics that kill most, if not all, individuals infected. Thus, howler populations are unlikely to play an important role in maintaining this virus in the continent, and there is no evidence that the virus can remain endemically in their populations. In fact, the mosquitoes could be the main reservoirs of yellow fever, as they are infected throughout their life, and can transmit the virus transovarially through infected eggs [Tomori, 2004]. Humans and monkeys, on the other hand, play the role of temporary amplifiers. Changes in weather conditions, like heavy rain- fall combined with warm temperatures, have been related to YFOs [Vasconcelos et al., 2001]. Heavy rainfalls create the optimal situation for vector mosquito breeding and, as a consequence, for the expansion of the virus [WHO, 1985; Shope, 1997]. Both YFOs were discovered because of the death of howlers in months with heavy rainfall, in association with warm temperatures (Fig. 2). Climatic conditions in April 2008 were similar to the months when YFO started, but no YFO was reported, suggesting that high rainfall and warm climate are necessary, but alone are not sufficient conditions to trigger YFOs in the study area. Our results thus do not support a simple model for a relationship between rainfall/ temperature and epidemic outbreaks, but instead point to multifarious causation of YFOs. Other factors, like invasive human activities, could also contribute to the generation of appro- priate conditions favoring YFOs [Vasconcelos et al., 2001]. Deforestation for cattle ranching and wood trade, flooding of extensive areas for dam construc- tions, and construction of highways dissecting forests Fig. 2. Rainfall and mean temperature (1SD), during the YFOs (arrows) and average rainfall and mean temperature from 1999 to 2008. November 2007 and October 2008 show the highest rainfall with warm temperatures (over 201C), but heavy rainfall for October 2008 was within the normal range of variation. April 2008 show similar rainfall and temperature values without YFO. Am. J. Primatol. 478 / Holzmann et al. disturb the natural dynamics of the ecosystem, and are related to the emergence and reemergence of dangerous viruses that affect humans and wildlife [Vasconcelos et al., 2001]. The current expansion of yellow fever in South America raises concern about the potential conserva- tion problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent, as in some species it causes drastic population reductions and genetic erosion. Before the YFOs were reported, the size of the brown howler population in Argentina was unknown, but certainly small, given the rarity of both howler species in Misiones [Di Bitetti, 2003]. The relatively high frequency of YFOs in the region (four major outbreaks reported since the mid 1960s) might contribute to the rarity of the species. After these outbreaks, with the local death of most individuals (as in El Piñalito), and the possibility of recurrent episodes of the disease, the conservation status of howler monkeys in Misiones is particularly worrying. This small and fragmented population suffering habitat destruction, hunting pressure and cyclical events of yellow fever is at a serious risk of disappearing in the long term [Di Bitetti et al., 1994]. To ensure the survival of howler monkeys, actions should be encouraged at four different levels. First, since humans are involved in the amplification of the virus, human vaccination should constitute a priority. This will reduce both the number of human cases and the sources of virus for mosquitoes and the transmission of the disease to other species. Second, environmental education programs should be devel- oped to involve the local communities surrounding the protected areas. Local residents sometimes capture monkeys (especially howlers because of their peaceful temper) to keep or sell them as pets. As a collateral effect of the recent YFOs in Misiones, Brazil and Paraguay, some people have killed howler monkeys because they are thought to be the cause of the disease, ignoring the importance of conserving them to have an early warning system for the human population [Bicca-Marques, 2009]. Third, collabora- tive work should be conducted between the national and provincial–state governments that make deci- sions about the management of the protected areas, timber extraction, health, and construction projects that are likely to have major ecological effects. Fourth, collaborative and trans-disciplinary research should be carried out to shed light on the determi- nants of virus circulation, on the role of primate species in the eco-epidemiology of the disease, and on the impact that the virus has on the population dynamics and conservation of non-human primates.

DOI: 10.1089/vbz.2007.0283 Serologic Survey of Birds for West Nile Flavivirus in Southern Moravia (Czech Republic) Z. HUBÁLEK,1 J. HALOUZKA,1 Z. JUŘICOVÁ,1 S. ŠIKUTOVÁ,1 I. RUDOLF,1 M. HONZA,1 J. JANKOVÁ,1 J. CHYTIL,2 F. MAREC,3 and J. SITKO2 ABSTRACT A serosurvey for West Nile virus (WNV) was carried out in 54 domestic birds (geese and ducks bred on fishponds) and 391 wild birds representing 28 migratory and resident species, using a plaque-reduction neutralization mi- crotest with Vero cells and Egyptian topotype Eg-101 strain as test virus. The birds were sampled in the South- Moravian fishpond ecosystem between 2004 and 2006. Antibodies to WNV were not detected in domestic water- fowl, but 23 (5.9%) free-living birds of 10 species showed a positive response. These were the common coot (Fulica atra, 5 positive/18 examined), common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis, 1/1), reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus, 2/80), sedge warbler (A. schoenobaenus, 3/80), marsh warbler (A. palustris, 2/28), Savi’s warbler (Locustella luscinioides, 3/12), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus, 1/28), blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla, 2/11), penduline tit (Remiz penduli- nus, 1/14), blue tit (Parus caeruleus, 1/1), and starling (Sturnus vulgaris, 2/4). The antibody titers were compara- tively low (1:20–1:40), and the only high titer (1:160) was found in an adult marsh warbler. When 14 of the sera re- acting with WNV were titrated in parallel with Usutu Flavivirus, 12 were interpreted as having specific antibodies to WNV, one coot had a higher titer against Usutu virus, and another one could not be attributed to either of the two viruses. In conclusion, 13 (3.3%) of 391 wild birds had specific antibodies to WNV. The results indicate that WNV activity in southern Moravia was limited during 2004–2006. Key Words: Birds––Field studies––Immunol- ogy––Mosquito(es)––West Nile 659 INTRODUCTION WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV, family Flaviviridae)circulates in natural foci between birds and bird-feeding mosquitoes largely of the genus Culex (Cx. pipiens and Cx. modestus in Eu- rope). This virus could be occasionally trans- ported by migratory birds to temperate coun- tries of the northern hemisphere from (sub)tropical countries, or vice versa (Hannoun et al. 1972; Watson et al. 1972; Malkinson et al. 2002). The aim of the present study was to evalu- ate the present activity of WNV in southern Moravia (Czech Republic), using an indirect method of serological survey of birds thought to be potentially exposed to the virus in the field. West Nile virus had already been isolated in this region (Hubálek et al. 1998; Bakonyi et al. 2005), as well as in neighboring Slovakia (Labuda et al. 1974), and five human cases of WNV fever were described after floods in southern Moravia in 1997 (Hubálek et al. 2000).

A fishpond near Moravský Krumlov (49°02� N, 16°18� E): 12 domestic ducks bred on a waterfowl farm, sampled on 7 Novem- ber 2005. Sampling Blood samples (in passerines and other small birds 50–150 �L, in waterfowl about 1 mL) were collected from the brachial vein (in small passerines by its puncturing with miniature sy- ringe needle and aspiration into hematocrit capillaries: Juřicová et al. 1986) of captured birds. Wild birds were trapped in mist-nets during a regular ringing action of the Czech So- ciety for Ornithology managed in accord with the Czech Animal Protection Act (no. 246/92). The wild birds were aged, sexed, ringed, and released after the blood collection. The water- birds on site 2 were sampled during spring hunts under relevant permits. The blood sam- ples were centrifuged in the laboratory 3–6 hours after collection, and the separated sera were stored at �20°C until use.

Vero cell sus- pension (in L-15 with 3% FCS) was then added to each test well (60 �L with 20,000–30,000 cells per well). After an incubation at 37°C for 4 hours, 120 �L of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt overlay (1.5% CMC of medium vis- cosity BDH in PBS mixed with the same vol- ume of L-15 with 3% of inactivated FCS) was added to each well. Controls included the virus test dose and its titration, immune WNV refer- ence serum, control negative serum, and cells without virus. The microplates, sealed in small polyethylene bags, were incubated at 37°C for 5 days, and the cultures were then stained with 0.1% acidic solution of naphthalene black (Fluka). Sera reactive with virus, revealing 90% or greater reduction in the number of plaques at the 1:10 dilution at screening (corresponding to the 1:20 final dilution of the serum after mix- ing with the virus test dose), were titrated in duplicate by twofold dilutions, and those dilu- tions corresponding to 90% reduction of plaque numbers were regarded as the serum titers (PRN�T90). Reciprocal titers �20 were consid- ered positive. The positive sera were also tested against Flavivirus Usutu (USUV; strain 939/01 Vero3) in order to exclude cross reactions with this related mosquito-borne virus that occurs occasionally in Central Europe. RESULTS All tested domestic waterfowl (18 geese, 36 ducks) at sites 3 and 4 were negative at 1:20 di- lution. Similarly, all wild anseriform birds were seronegative at sites 2 and 3. Overall, 23 of 391 (5.9%) examined wild birds belonging to 28 species collected in the reedbelt habitat of sev- eral fishponds reacted with WNV at titers 1:20 or higher (Table 1): 5/18 (no. positive/no.ex- amined) common coots, 2/80 reed warblers, 3/80 sedge warblers, 2/28 marsh warblers, 3/12 Savi’s warblers, 1/28 reed buntings, 1/14 penduline tits, 2/11 blackcaps, 1/1 blue tit, 2/4 starlings, and 1/1 common kingfisher. Four- teen of these seroreacting birds were examined in PRN�T90 with USUV in parallel, and two of them (common coots) also reacted with the lat- ter virus at titers similar to WNV or higher (Table 2): whereas coot #Z22 was interpreted as having specific antibodies to USUV, coot #Z32 revealed a flavivirus cross reaction not specific for WNV or for USUV, and its anti- bodies have been regarded as undetermined. In contrast, 12 birds have been regarded as re- acting specifically with WNV. The remaining 9 seropositive birds could not be tested with USUV because of the small amount of sera, but the high titer (1:160) in an adult marsh warbler (#N104) was also attributed to specific WNV antibodies. Therefore at least 13 wild birds (3.3%) reacted with WNV specifically, although the titers were, with one exception low, 1:20 to 1:40 (Table 2). Eight of these birds with specific WNV antibodies were adults, and five were young (hatching-year) individuals. Of 445 tested birds, 192 were young (hatch- ing-year) birds, and 253 were adult (after hatch- ing-year) birds. There was no significant dif- ference in the seroprevalence rate between young and adult birds overall, nor between the young and adult passerines (Table 1; �2 test). Also, when only specific WNV-seroreactors were taken into account (Table 2), there was no significant difference in the seroprevalence rate: 2.6% in young birds versus 3.2% in adults. DISCUSSION The plaque-reduction neutralization test is regarded as the gold standard in flavivirus serology and is used for verification of other serological tests (enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay [ELISA], hemagglutination-inhibi- tion test [HIT]) because it is generally more spe- cific and discriminatory. However, it is well known that flaviviruses present a high degree SEROLOGIC SURVEY OF BIRDS IN SOUTHERN MORAVIA 661 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 4/ 09 /1 9.

Often, several anti- genically closely related flaviviruses of the same antigenic group co-occur in one area— e.g., in Central Europe USUV together with WNV, both members of Japanese encephalitis group (Weissenböck et al. 2002, 2003; Linke et al. 2007). It is therefore sometimes very diffi- cult to decide which virus was responsible for the antibody production. In the present study, we used neutralization with the standard topotype Egyptian strain Eg- 101 of WNV (its suckling mouse brain ho- mogenate) and carefully stored and thermally inactivated avian serum (not plasma) samples devoid of heparin, citrate, ethylenediaminete- traacetic acid (EDTA), or any stabilizing sub- stances like merthiolate. In addition, the lot of fetal calf serum used in PRN�T was tested for antibodies against WNV in a separate assay. We estimated the results conservatively, as a 90% reduction in the number of plaques (not a 50% reduction, which is sometimes consid- ered), and 1:20 dilution (instead of the usual 1:10) as a titer cut-off point. It is obvious that these parameters could affect the results (Buck- ley et al. 2006; Figuerola et al. 2007), and it is therefore advisable to interpret results of fla- vivirus serology with great care, especially dur- ing the serosurveys in birds and wild mammals (e.g., shot-killed game animals) where nonspe- cific inhibitors of viruses could occasionally oc- HUBÁLEK ET AL.662 TABLE 1.

Previous serologic evidence of the WNV presence in the habitat of fishponds Nesyt at Sedlec was based on (1) detection of WNV an- tibodies in several local young (hatching-year) birds in 1985—1 Savi’s warbler, 1 marsh war- bler, 3 sedge warblers, 6 reed warblers, 3 bearded tits (Panurus biarmicus), 1 penduline tit, and 1 blue tit (Hubálek et al. 1989); and (2) se- roconversion to WNV in 29% of 110 domestic ducks kept solely on the Nesyt pond in 1988, demonstrating that the virus was established in this fishpond area (Juřicová and Halouzka 1993). In a previous study by Hubálek et al. (1989), 4.3% of 704 wild birds examined in southern Moravia (most sampled in the same location on the Nesyt fishpond as in this study) during 1984–1986 had HI antibodies against WNV—a figure nearly identical to the present result (20 years later) when 5.0% of 319 birds captured on Nesyt fishpond were seropositive against WNV. Common pochards were all seronegative in this study, as were 21 ducks of the same species in southern Spain (Figuerola et al. 2007a); also, other wild anseriform species were seronega- tive. However, three of 18 common coots (16.7%) were seropositive in this study, ap- proaching results in Doñana wetlands (Spain), where 15%–50% of common coots revealed an- tibodies to WNV during the years 2003–2006, with a very high seroconversion rate of 17% in 2004 and 2005 (Figuerola et al. 2007b). In addi- tion, one common coot was positive for USUV. The common coot is obviously a good indica- tor of the WNV presence and circulation. It is more easily accessible than anseriforms for feeding mosquitoes, because of bald spots in the plumage on the head, and long skinny legs that are exposed to mosquitoes on the shore. Interestingly, all 30 examined individuals of the great reed warbler were negative in our sur- vey, and similarly no WNV antibodies were found in 47 birds of this species on the Neusiedlersee in Austria (Aspöck et al. 1973), whereas other species of ecologically similar wetland warblers were positive in both areas (3 of 224 reed warblers, and 1 of 15 Savi’s war- bler in Austria).

(1973) examined HI antibodies in birds trapped in the reedbelt habitat on the Neusiedlersee during the autumn of 1971 (0.6% of 488 birds were seropositive to WNV), the winter of 1971 (all 125 negative), and the spring of 1972 (2.8% of 142 examined were positive). The difference between the autumn and spring seroprevalence rates indicated that at least some seropositive birds in spring had been in- fected with WNV in their winter stay in Africa—the individuals all included trans-Sa- haran migratory species: the Savi’s warbler, the reed warbler, and the moustached warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon). According to ring- ing recoveries, of the seropositive bird species found in the present study, the reed warbler, the sedge warbler, the marsh warbler, and the Savi’s warbler, are trans-Saharan migrants; the blackcap is also migratory, overwintering in the Mediterranean and Africa; the common coot, the kingfisher, the penduline tit, the star- ling, and the reed bunting are migratory species wintering in the Mediterranean (mainly in northern Italy, but the common coot and starling also winter in western Mediterranean countries, including Spain); and the blue tit is a resident (sedentary) species although some individuals migrate from Moravia to northern Italy (Hudec 1983; Hudec and Št’astný 2005). It could mean that WNV seropositive adult birds had been infected in Africa or in southern Eu- rope, while young (hatching-year) birds were infected in Moravia (or northeastern Europe). Maternal antibodies against WNV, transferred passively via egg yolk from seropositive fe- males, can persist in birds on average for only 2–4 weeks (Gibbs et al. 2005; Buckley et al. 2006; Hahn et al. 2006). Identical results were de- scribed for the related mosquito-borne fla- vivirus of Japanese encephalitis (Buescher et al. 1959; Scherer et al. 1959). Because the hatching season of seropositive bird species of Central Europe is April to May (starling, blue tit) or May to June (the warblers: Hudec 1983), the an- tibodies found in young birds during the sec- ond half of July (i.e., beyond one month after hatching) were probably not maternal ones, but could have been formed after a WNV infection transmitted by mosquitoes in Moravia. In the present study we did not find a sig- nificant difference in the seroprevalence rate between juvenile and adult birds. It is obvious that juvenile birds may be infected in the breed- ing grounds, whereas adult birds may be in- fected in the breeding grounds, during migra- tory stopovers, and in wintering areas. In general, the data indicate indirectly lim- ited WNV activity among birds in South Moravia during 2004–2006, when only 3.3% of wild birds were seropositive against WNV. This is in concordance with findings in free-liv- ing birds from some other European countries between 2001 and 2005. For instance, no or very low activity of WNV was documented in free- living birds in France both near Lyon (all 364 examined birds were seronegative: Lena et al. 2006) and in the Camargue (1.8% of 227 birds: Jourdain et al. 2007; or 4.6% of 388 passerines in 2004: E. Jourdain, pers. comm.); and in Ger- many (1.6% seroprevalence in 3,399 birds: Linke et al. 2007). Higher seroprevalence rates in that time period were found in some birds living in traditional enzootic areas for WNV in Europe: e.g., southern France (the Rhone delta—the Camargue), where 10.7% of 271 magpies (Pica pica) had antibodies to WNV (Jourdain et al. 2008) or southern Spain (the Quadalquivir delta—Doñana), where 7.3% of 534 nearly full-grown chicks of seven waterbird species had antibodies to WNV (Figuerola et al. 2007a). The only deviating study is that for Great Britain, where as much as 14.7% of 353 wild birds reacted with WNV in PRNT90 in 2001–2002 (Buckley et al. 2003); the authors considered titers as low as 1:10 to be positive, and they did not use the topotype WNV strain, but three other WNV strains yielding widely varying results. The detection of antibodies in one common coot (# Z22), probably attributable to USUV, is of interest. This adult migratory bird could the- oretically have been infected in neighboring Austria, where this virus of African origin has appeared since 2001 (Weissenböck et al. 2002).

KRUSZEWICZ,5 ZBIGNIEW JAWORSKI,6 and RADOSL[ AW WL[ ODARCZYK7 ABSTRACT A survey for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV; genus Flavivirus) was carried out by plaque-re- duction neutralization microtesting in 78 horses, 20 domestic chickens, and 97 wild birds belonging to 10 species from different areas in Poland. Specific antibodies were detected in five juvenile (hatch- ing-year) birds collected in 2006: three white storks (Ciconia ciconia) in a wildlife rehabilitation cen- ter (5.4% of all examined storks; the antibody titers in each bird were 1:320, 1:160, and 1:20), one free-living mute swan (Cygnus olor; the titer was 1:20), and one hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix; the titer 1:20) in a wildlife rehabilitation center; thus the overall seropositivity to WNV was 5.2% among all the birds sampled. These data do not rule out the presence of WNV activity in Poland with 100% certainty, but they indicate a significant trace that demands verification. In addition, one black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus) had neutralizing antibodies for the Usutu Flavivirus, the first case recorded in Poland. 247 1Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic. 2Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland. 3Adam Mickiewicz University, Department of Behavioural Ecology, Poznań, Poland. 4University of Zielona Góra, Faculty of Biology, Zielona Góra, Poland. 5Warsaw Zoological Garden, Warsaw, Poland. 6University of Warmia and Mazury, Faculty of Animal Bioengineering, Olsztyn, Poland. 7Department of Teacher Training and Biodiversity Studies, University of Lodz, Poland. INTRODUCTION WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV; FAMILY FLAVIVIRIDAE) cir-culates in natural foci between birds and bird-feed- ing mosquitoes, principally Culex pipiens, C. modestus, and Coquillettidia richiardii in Europe (13). WNV has not yet been isolated in Poland, unlike neighboring Czechland (14,15) and Slovakia (7,18). Antibodies in- hibiting hemagglutination of WNV were detected in spar- rows (Passer domesticus and P. montanus) near Warsaw (16), though this result was not verified by virus neu- tralization testing. WNV is occasionally introduced by birds migrating to temperate countries of the Northern Hemisphere from tropical and subtropical countries (7,10,25,30). More- over, there are predictions according to climate change models that transmission of WNV may soon become more intense and rapid (6). The aim of this study was to assess the level of WNV activity in Poland, by performing a serologic survey of vertebrates (horses and birds) that are prone to viral ex- posure in the field. Horses are especially susceptible to WNV and form antibodies easily; white storks are also susceptible, as are corvids (23,28).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood sampling Blood samples from 50 horses of the Polish konik va- riety originating from Popielno (Mazurian Lakeland) (site A on the map shown in Fig. 1), and 28 horses of the same breed from Roztocze National Park (site B on Fig. 1) were collected in October 2006 (Table 1). These horses lived free in their natural habitats. The Polish konik is a local horse breed originating directly from the wild Tarpan horse (Equus caballus gmelini form silvatica). These horses are highly resistant to tough environmental conditions, and have lower feeding needs and a higher level of natural immunity compared to other breeds of horses (17). Blood samples from free-living birds were collected in 2006 by puncturing the jugular or brachial vein, and the birds were released after sample collection. Swans were captured for banding at two breeding terri- tories near Sieradz: on the ponds in the village of Jeziory and an oxbow lake near the village of Bilew (site 3 on Fig. 1). White storks were sampled either as nestlings from the Wielkopolska region (site 5 on Fig. 1; 48 indi- viduals) during two breeding seasons (2002 and 2003), or as birds living in a few wildlife rehabilitation cen- ters (8 hatching-year birds in 2006; Table 1). Some other birds (crows, rooks, jackdaws, and pigeons) also visited HUBÁLEK ET AL. the Wildbird Rehabilitation Centre in Warsaw (site 4 on Fig. 1) between July 25 and September 13, 2006, where they were brought after being found injured elsewhere in the country, most being from the Mazovian Lowland (near Warsaw). Other wild birds were caught in Japan- ese nets in the region of Podlasie (site 2 on Fig. 1) in the Siemianówka water reservoir (near Bial[owieża National Park and the Belarussian border) at the end of July 2006. Domestic chickens were sampled on an ecological farm in the region of the Mazurian Lakeland at Pokrzydowo (site 1 on Fig. 1) in October 2006. All Polish laws and regulations regarding protection, conservation, and ani- mal welfare were adhered to during all sampling proce- dures, which were endorsed by Polish local ethics com- mittees and the Ministry of the Environment. Blood samples were centrifuged in the laboratory within 3–6 h after collection, and the separated sera were then stored at �20°C until use. Plaque reduction neutralization microtest (PRN�T) This method was originally proposed by Madrid and Porterfield (21,22), and was later adapted into a mi- crotechnique done in flat-bottomed, 96-well disposable sterile microplates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) used for tis- sue culture (12).

Tested sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 min and diluted 1:10 for screening in L-15 with 3% inactivated FCS, then 30 �L of the diluted sera was mixed with 30 �L of test dose of the virus (con- taining 20–30 PFU of the Eg-101 SM17 strain of WNV) in L-15 supplemented with 3% inactivated FCS. The plates were then covered and incubated at 37°C for 60 min; then 60 �L of the Vero cell suspension was added to each test well (20,000–30,000 cells/well), and after incubating covered at 37°C for 4 h, 120 �L of carboxy- methylcellulose (CMC) sodium salt were added (1.5% CMC of medium viscosity BDH in PBS mixed with the same volume of L-15 mixed with 3% inactivated FCS). Controls included a test dose of the virus and its serial twofold dilutions and immune WNV reference serum; control negative serum; and cells without virus. Incu- bation of the plastic-sealed cultures at 37°C lasted 5 d, and the microplate cultures were then stained with a 0.1% acidic solution of naphthol blue black (FLUKA, Switzerland) at room temperature for 40 min. Sera that were reactive with WNV, revealing 90% or greater reduction of plaques at the 1:10 dilution (corre- sponding to the 1:20 final dilution of the serum, after mixing with the virus test dose), were titrated by twofold dilutions, and dilutions corresponding to 90% reduction of PFU were regarded as the serum titers (PRN�T90). Reciprocal titers �20 were considered positive. Positive sera were also tested in parallel (PRN�T90) against Fla- vivirus Usutu (USUV; strain 939/01 Vero3) to exclude cross-reaction with this related mosquito-borne virus found in Central Europe (35). SEROLOGIC SURVEY OF VERTEBRATE HOSTS FOR WNV RESULTS None of the 78 horses examined had antibodies to WNV (one animal showed a titer of 1:10, which was con- sidered negative). Similarly, none of the 20 chickens and 48 nestling white storks tested positive for WNV (Table 1). Although sera from 19 of the 97 free-living birds ex- amined (19.6%) reacted on PRN�T90 with WNV titers of at least 1:20, most of them also had USUV titers at similar or higher levels (Table 2), and these results were interpreted as cross-reactions non-specific for WNV. In all only five birds (5.2%) reacted with WNV specifically, namely juvenile white storks (nos. 126, 127, and 128), which were kept in the wildlife rehabilitation center (WRC) after being injured in the field. Their antibody titers against WNV were 1:320, 1:160, and 1:20, respec- tively, while titers to USUV were low or absent (in to- tal, 5.4% of the 56 storks tested had antibodies to WNV); USUV titers were also present in one juvenile mute swan (no. 6551; titer 1:20) and one juvenile hooded crow (no. 27; titer 1:20) from a WRC. One bird, a young black- headed gull (no. 16), reacted with USUV at a titer of 1:80, which was higher than that against WNV (1:20–1:40). DISCUSSION There is speculation about the possible presence of WNV in Poland (31). Some bird species that are known to carry WNV are common in Poland (e.g., the white stork [Ciconia ciconia], garganey [Anas querquedula], common coot [Fulica atra], lapwing [Vanellus vanellus], black-headed gull [Larus ridibundus], turtle dove [Strep- 249 TABLE 1.

Most of them are migratory and can potentially spread the pathogen along their migration routes. Moreover, six mosquito species that were previously reported positive for WNV in other European countries (13), are common in Poland: Culex pipiens, C. modestus, and Coquillettidia richiardii—species believed to be common vectors in Eu- rope—as well as Ochlerotatus dorsalis, O. caspius, and the flood-water mosquito, Aedes vexans (32). However, an outbreak of human cases of West Nile fever (WNF) has never been reported in Poland, although it is possi- ble that human WNF cases may go unnoticed in this country. For instance, epidemic reports showed a three- to fivefold increase of the incidence of aseptic meningi- tis in the areas flooded in 1997 and in the district of Gdańsk, where a flood occurred in 2001 (31), and where enormous numbers of mosquitos subsequently appeared. At the same time, there were no mass deaths of birds ob- served, which some researchers regard as a sign of the presence of WNV (however, this is true only for North America, and not for Europe). Only one paper indicated the possible presence of WNV in Poland by detection of antibodies to WNV in 3%–12% of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and tree sparrows (P. montanus) captured near Warsaw (16), us- ing a hemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT). Unfortu- nately, this finding could not be verified by a more spe- cific neutralization test. In HIT (and ELISA as well), HUBÁLEK ET AL. cross-reactions among flaviviruses are very common and well known (e.g., even cross-reactions between WNV and tick-borne encephalitis virus). The plaque-reduction neutralization test is regarded as the gold standard in fla- vivirus serology, and is generally more specific than other serological techniques (33,34). However, significant serological Flavivirus cross-reactivity can sometimes oc- cur even in the neutralization test (4,5,22,24,28). Often several antigenically related flaviviruses of the same anti- genic group co-occur in one area (e.g., in central Europe Usutu virus together with WNV, both members of the Japanese encephalitis group) (20,35). It is sometimes dif- ficult to decide which particular antigen was responsible for antibody production, and thus controversial results may be published. It is always necessary to interpret re- sults of flavivirus serology with great care, especially dur- ing serosurveys in birds and wild mammals, where non- specific inhibitors of hemagglutination and neutralization can occasionally occur (11,28). In this study, we used neutralization (PRN�T) with the standard, topotype Egyptian strain Eg-101 of WNV (its suckling mouse brain homogenate), and carefully stored and thermally inactivated avian serum (not plasma) sam- ples devoid of heparin, citrate, or any stabilizing sub- stances like merthiolate. We estimated the results con- servatively, and used 90% reduction in the number of plaques (not 50% reduction, which is sometimes used), and 1:20 dilution (instead of the usual 1:10) as a titer cut- off point. In addition, the fetal calf serum used in the 250 TABLE 2.

PRN�T was tested for antibodies against WNV in a sep- arate assay. Our data indicate only limited WNV activity in Poland in 2006. The three juvenile white storks with specific an- tibodies to WNV, sampled on September 13, 2006, were either born in Poland or arrived from nearby countries endemic for WNV in northeastern or eastern Europe (e.g., Latvia, Belarus, or the Ukraine) (13). White storks are susceptible to WNV infection, and WNV was isolated in Israel from migrating white storks, supposedly arriving from eastern or central Europe (23). It is noteworthy to mention that white storks from Poland and eastern parts of Germany migrate via the Middle East, along the fly- way leading southeast through the Marmara Sea and Turkey, then turning to the south near the Gulf of Isk- enderun and through the Sinai, reaching the Suez Bay and approaching the Nile; they then disperse across east- ern and southern Africa (29). Maternal antibodies against WNV, transferred pas- sively via egg yolks from seropositive females, can per- sist in nestling birds for 2–4 weeks (1,8,9). Identical re- sults were described for the related mosquito-borne flavivirus causing Japanese encephalitis (3,27). Because the hatching season of the seropositive bird species is from April to June in Central Europe, the antibodies found in young birds in August and September (i.e., �2 months after hatching; egg laying occurs at the end of April, and the majority of eggs are hatched in May) should not be regarded as maternal ones, but as antibod- ies formed after natural WNV infection. The relatively high proportion of positive serological results among patients in wild bird rehabilitation centers (three storks and one hooded crow out of 21 avian pa- tients) is not surprising, since birds with CNS disorders are most susceptible to accidents. On the other hand, the seropositive young mute swan (although the titer was low) was apparently healthy and free-living, and a num- ber of healthy individuals captured on the water reser- voirs (Siemianówka and Bilew) were classified as sero- logically undetermined, and most of them were juveniles. These results are essential to understanding how WNV spreads, especially in light of the fact that summer 2006 was extremely dry and therefore unfavorable for growth of mosquito vectors. The results of our study correlate well with findings from some other European studies done between 2000 and 2005. No or very low WNV activity was observed in free-living birds near Lyon in France (19), as all 364 birds examined were seronegative, and in Germany (20), where seroprevalence was 1.6% in 3399 birds. However, the German study showed a relatively high frequency of antibodies to WNV in predatory birds, especially in the migratory osprey (Pandion haliaetus), for which 20% of 140 birds examined had neutralizing antibodies. In addi- SEROLOGIC SURVEY OF VERTEBRATE HOSTS FOR WNV tion, 2.2% of mute swans, 2.3% of white storks, and six other avian species were seropositive as well. The only study deviating from this trend is one done in Great Britain in 2001–2002, where as many as 14.7% of 353 wild birds reacted with WNV in PRNT90 (2), but the au- thors considered titers as low as 1:10 to be positive, and they did not use the topotype WNV strain, but instead used three other WNV strains that yielded varying re- sults. Negative results obtained in white stork nestlings cannot exclude the possible presence of WNV in the study area. Malkinson et al. (23) did not find antibod- ies in white stork nestlings in the Golan Heights in 2000, although WNF cases were frequent among geese and humans and the virus circulated in the area. Ger- man observations also show that the nestlings (2–9 wk old) of white storks were mostly serologically negative, although very low antibody titers (1:10–1:15, and only one bird had a titer of 1:30) against WNV were de- tected in 10 of them, most probably due to maternal immunity passed vertically to the young. At the same time several post-hatching year storks and ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) showed much higher titers of an- tibodies against WNV (20). On this basis it can be stated that nestlings of the white stork are not suitable for a serologic survey for WNV. The negative results found in horses also deserve com- ment. The horse—Polish konik—is a breed closely re- lated to a species of wild horse (tarpan), and is a de- scendant of a primitive, wild species. Recent studies of the Polish konik show that it has a high level of natural immunity (26). In a similar central European study serum samples from 350 horses from eastern Austria were ex- amined for WNV, and all were also negative, while 4 of 35 horses transported from Hungary to Germany were seropositive, although these animals had no obvious clin- ical signs on examination (34). CONCLUSION Our study has not confirmed with 100% certainty the circulation of WNV in Poland, but the results show tan- gible traces of seropositivity that demand verification. This study also revealed for the first time in Poland an- tibodies to Usutu virus, a mosquito-borne Flavivirus re- cently recognized as occurring in Central Europe (35). The bird that tested positive, a black-headed gull, was a hatching-year specimen, and it could have been born in Poland or in any other central European country, includ- ing Austria. Further study is needed to more accurately define how West Nile virus spreads in Europe, as well as how to con- trol its spread. 251 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 4/ 09 /1 9.

Hubalek-2012-Tick-borne viruses in Europe.pdf	"REVIEW Tick-borne viruses in Europe Zdenek Hubálek & Ivo Rudolf Received: 23 January 2012 /Accepted: 20 March 2012 /Published online: 18 April 2012 # Springer-Verlag 2012 Abstract The aim of this review is to present briefly back- ground information on 27 tick-borne viruses (“tiboviruses”) that have been detected in Europe, viz flaviviruses tick- borne encephalitis (TBEV), louping-ill (LIV), Tyuleniy (TYUV), and Meaban (MEAV); orthobunyaviruses Bahig (BAHV) and Matruh (MTRV); phleboviruses Grand Arbaud (GAV), Ponteves (PTVV), Uukuniemi (UUKV), Zaliv Terpeniya (ZTV), and St. Abb's Head (SAHV); nairoviruses Soldado (SOLV), Puffin Island (PIV), Avalon (AVAV), Clo Mor (CMV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV); bunyavirus Bhanja (BHAV); coltivirus Eyach (EYAV); orbi- viruses Tribec (TRBV), Okhotskiy (OKHV), Cape Wrath (CWV), Mykines (MYKV), Tindholmur (TDMV), and Bau- line (BAUV); two thogotoviruses (Thogoto THOV, Dhori DHOV); and one asfivirus (African swine fever virus ASFV). Emphasis is laid on the taxonomic status of these viruses, range of their ixodid or argasid vectors and vertebrate hosts, pathogenicity for vertebrates including humans, and relevance to public health. In general, three groups of tibovirus diseases can be recognized according to main clinical symptoms produced: (i) febrile illness—usually with a rapid onset, fever, sweating, headache, nausea, weak- ness, myalgia, arthralgia, sometimes polyarthritis and rash; (ii) the CNS affection—meningitis, meningoencephalitis or en- cephalomyelitis with pareses, paralysis and other sequelae; (iii) hemorrhagic disease. Several “European” tiboviruses cause very serious human (TBEV, CCHFV) or animal (LIV, ASFV) diseases. Other arboviruses play definite role in hu- man or animal pathology though the disease is usually either less serious or infrequently reported (TYUV, BHAV, AVAV, EYAV, TRBV, DHOV, THOV). The other European arbovi- ruses are “orphans” without a proven medical or veterinary significance (BAHV, MTRV, MEAV, GAV, PTVV, ZTV, SAHV, UUKV, SOLV, PIV, AVAV, CMV, OKHV, CWV, MYKV, TDMV, BAUV). However, certain arbovirus diseases of free-living vertebrates (but also those of domestic animals and even man) may often pass unnoticed or misdiagnosed and eventually, they might potentially appear as emerging dis- eases. Active search for new tiboviruses or for new, pathogen- ic variants of the known tiboviruses in Europe should therefore continue.

Hubálek (*) : I. Rudolf Institute of Vertebrate Biology, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Květná 8, 60365 Brno, Czech Republic e-mail: zhubalek@brno.cas.cz Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 DOI 10.1007/s00436-012-2910-1 (Ixodidae and Argasidae, respectively) to endotherm (homeotherm, warm-blooded) vertebrates. Competent vec- tors are those arthropods that are able to imbibe the virus in the course of blood-feeding on an infected donor vertebrate host, to support the multiplication of the virus in their organism and to deliver a sufficiently large inoculum to the recipient, uninfected vertebrate host. Usually certain minimum level of viremia (“infection threshold”) in a donor vertebrate host is necessary for an efficient infection of particular arthropod vectors. Therefore, only those verte- brate species that produce at least moderate viremia have been regarded as competent, “true” or “amplifying” hosts of particular arboviruses (Bárdoš 1979). However, co-feeding ixodid ticks on a viremia-free host can sometimes also contribute to infection of noninfected ticks (Jones et al. 1987; Alekseev and Chunikhin 1990; Labuda et al. 1993). Some tiboviruses are transmitted from larvae to nymphs and imagoes during metamorphosis (transstadial transmission, TST), from infected female to the offspring (transovarial transmission, TOT), and from male to female tick during copulation (venereal or horizontal transmission). These modes are extremely important ecologically: e.g., under conditions of TOT, the tick vector also plays the role of a long-term reservoir of the virus. In addition to two “major” severe, occasionally re-emerging virus diseases transmitted by ixodid ticks in Europe, viz tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hem- orrhagic fever, there is a number of other, neglected tick-borne virus infections of vertebrates. They are usually infrequent, although some of them are probably underdiagnosed, and other of these tiboviruses are nonpathogenic, or of low path- ogenicity, for vertebrates (Tables 1 and 2). This review briefly summarizes present knowledge espe- cially on the taxonomy, ecology, epidemiology and distri- bution of European tiboviruses; for related reviews and additional, more detailed data, see, e.g. Theiler and Downs (1973), Karabatsos (1985), Málková et al. (1986), Lvov et al. (1989), Hubálek and Halouzka (1996), Charrel et al. (2004), Labuda and Nuttall (2004), Gratz (2006), and Dobler (2010). The virus taxonomy and nomenclature has been adopted from King et al. (2012). Family Flaviviridae Flavivirus of tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) There are three recognized TBEV subtypes: (1) Western or European subtype (TBEV-W), also called Central European (CEEV—topotype strains are Hypr and Neudoerfl) or some- times “ricinus” subtype (Clarke 1964; Votyakov et al. 1978; Rubin and Chumakov 1980; Calisher 1988; Calisher et al. 1989; Gritsun et al. 2003; Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008)— varieties of this subtype are Spanish sheep encephalitis (SSE), Turkish sheep encephalitis (TSE) and Greek goat encephalitis (“Vergina”) viruses; these three varieties are antigenically more closely related to TBEV-W (CEEV) than to louping ill virus (Hubálek et al. 1995); (2) (Ural-)Siberian subtype (TBEV-S: the prototype strains are Aina and Vasil- chenko), sometimes called “persulcatus” subtype, causing Russian spring–summer encephalitis (RSSEV:); (3) Far Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE with prototype strain Sofyin, isolated from human brain in Khabarovsk, 1937). However, all three subtypes occur in Europe—the TBEV-S and TBEV-FE subtypes were recently detected in the Baltic republics and eastern Finland (Golovljova et al. 2004; Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). A taxonomic and nomencla- tural confusion around TBEV has repeatedly been em- phasized (Clarke 1964; Calisher 1988; Holzmann et al. 1992). In addition, TBEV is very closely related to louping-ill virus which should be regarded in fact as the fourth (or, historically, the first) subtype of TBEV (see below). History: in Europe, RSSEV subtype of TBEV was first isolated in the Russian Ural Mts. in 1938 (Chumakov and Zeitlenok 1939), and CEEV (strain “256”) from Ixodes ricinus ticks collected near Minsk, Belarus in 1940 (Levkovich and Karpovich 1962; Votyakov et al. 1978). Further isolations of CEEV were reported in Czechland from human patients and I. ricinus ticks in 1948–1949 (Gallia et al. 1949; Krejčí 1949; Rampas and Gallia 1949). Principal arthropod vectors are ticks of the genus Ixodes: for CEEV I. ricinus (TST, TOT: Benda 1958b; Řeháček 1962; the infection rate may attain 0.5 % to 3 % in valent natural foci: Grešíková 1972), and Ixodes gibbosus (a vicar- iant, marginal vector in the Mediterranean). Occasional vectors are other tick species such as Ixodes hexagonus (Křivanec et al. 1988), possibly Ixodes arboricola (success- ful experimental transmission: Lichard and Kožuch 1967), while only sporadically metastriate tick species Haemaphy- salis inermis, Haemaphysalis concinna (Riedl et al. 1971; TOT), Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus, Dermacentor reticulatus (Georgiev et al. 1971; Kožuch and Nosek 1971; Naumov et al. 1980; Nosek and Kožuch 1985), and Hyalomma marginatum (Crimea). Main vector for RSSEV is Ixodes persulcatus (infection prevalence rates can reach frequently >2 %; TST, TOT: Chunikhin 1990), less often Ixodes ovatus, but also Dermacentor silvarum, D. reticulatus, D. marginatus, H. concinna (TOT), Haemaphy- salis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis japonica (Naumov et al. 1980). Competent vertebrate hosts of TBEV are small forest mammals, especially rodents and insectivores (Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Myodes glareolus, Myodes rufocanus, Microtus agrestis, Sciurus vulgaris, Talpa euro- paea, Sorex araneus, Erinaceus concolor); additional hosts 10 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 may be (due to viremia) goat, sheep, rarely cattle (Brummer- Korvenkontio et al. 1973; Kožuch et al. 1966, 1967a, b; Kiffner et al. 2011). The role of some forest passerines and other birds as hosts of TBEV has not yet been fully eluci- dated; the virus was isolated occasionally from Turdus pila- ris, Turdus iliacus, other Turdus spp., Corvus monedula, Corvus corone, Pica pica, Sturnus vulgaris, Lanius collurio, Fringilla montifringilla, Fringilla coelebs, Loxia curviros- tra, Carduelis flammea, Anthus trivialis, Motacilla alba, Motacilla flava, Emberiza spp., Jynx torquilla, Bonasa bonasia, Crex crex, Scolopax rusticola, Clangula hyemalis, Melanitta fusca, Anas querquedula, Fulica atra (Brummer- Korvenkontio et al. 1973; Ernek 1959; Ernek et al. 1977; Grešíková 1972; Grešíková et al. 1975; Hubálek 1994; Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Saikku 1973; Soběslavský et al. 1960; van Tongeren 1962). A potential for TOTwas demonstrated in some avian species (T. iliacus, T. pilaris, Turdus ruficol- lis, Turdus pallidus, Lanius cristatus, Emberiza fucata, Troglodytes troglodytes, Accipiter gentilis) in Asian Russia by isolation of TBEV from their eggs (Kraminskiy et al. 1972). Experimental viremia has been demonstrated in many mammalian, avian, amphibian, and reptilian species (Naumov and Gutova 1979; Naumov et al. 1983, 1984a, b; Gutova et al. 1985; Chunikhin 1990): Micromys minutus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus subterraneus (Radda et al. 1968), Myodes rufocanus, Myodes rutilus, Glis glis (Kožuch et al. 1963), Myotis myotis, Plecotus auritus, Barbastella barbastellus (Nosek et al. 1961), cat, Mustela nivalis, Mus- tela erminea (Radda et al. 1969), Coturnix coturnix, Anas platyrhynchos (van Tongeren 1983), Lacerta viridis, Table 1 Experimental pathogenicity of tiboviruses occurring in Europe (Karabatsos 1985; Hubálek and Halouzka 1996) SM SM M M H H GP GP C CE Other i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. s.c. y.s.

TBEV causes fatal disease in suckling and adult labora- tory mouse at any route including i.n. and p.o., suckling rat (i.c.) but not adult rat (i.c., i.p.), newborn guinea pig (i.c.), suckling hamster (i.c., i.p.), rhesus monkey (i.c., but not all strains, and not at i.n., i.p., s.c. or i.v. routes: Ilyenko et al. 1974; Zlotnik et al. 1976; Pogodina et al. 1981, 1986), lamb and kid (i.c., i.n. but not s.c.). The diffuse meningoenceph- alitis is characterized by perivascular infiltration, neuronal degeneration and necrosis, and focal glial proliferation. On the other hand, no mortality is produced by TBEV in adult forest rodents Apodemus and Myodes spp. (i.p., s.c.), adult rabbit (i.c., i.p.). Encephalitis with ataxia, jumping, tremor, and convulsions can affect lambs, kids or, exceptionally, dogs (Tipold et al. 1993; Pfeffer and Dobler 2011). CEEV infection is usually subclinical in adult ruminants and pig; goats, sheep, and cows excrete virus in the milk (Smoro- dintsev et al. 1953; van Tongeren 1955; Benda 1958a; Grešíková 1958a, b). TBEV (especially TBE-S and TBE- FE virus subtypes) occasionally kills birds of some species, e.g., C. flammea (long-term viremia and the virus excretion in droppings up to 11 months was confirmed experimental- ly), Passer domesticus, and F. atra (van Tongeren 1962; Hubálek 1994), amphibians Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo (s.c.). Natural foci of TBE have been classified (Rosický 1959) as “theriodic” (situated in deciduous and mixed forest eco- systems, often game preserves), “boskematic” (pastoral), mixed “theriodic-boskematic” or “mountain” (Rosický and Bárdoš 1966; Nosek et al. 1982). Urban foci of CEE have also been described in Europe (Málková et al. 1983).

Whereas the tick- transmitted cases are sporadic, the milk-borne infections usually affect whole families or population groups in out- breaks. For instance, a large milk-borne TBE epidemic occurred in Rožňava, East Slovakia in 1951, when 660 persons were infected and 274 of them hospitalized (Blaš- kovič 1954). As much as 76 % of human infections have been alimentary in Belarus (Ivanova 1984). The virus may resist in milk at 60°C for more than 10 min and partially even the pasteurization at 62°C for 20 min, and it is not inactivated at pH 2.8 within 24 h/4°C. In addition, many laboratory infections (usually by infectious aerosol) have been reported in unvaccinated personnel. Human disease caused by TBEV is meningoencephalitis, usually with typical biphasic course: the first phase starts with sudden fever and flu-like symptoms (pronounced head- ache, general weakness, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia), some- times conjunctivitis; the second phase appears after an interval of usually 4–7 days of an apparent recovery, with affection of the CNS (meningoencephalitis) accompanied with fever, retrobulbar pain, photophobia, stiff neck, sleep disorders, excessive sweating, drowsiness, tremors, nystag- mus, meningeal signs, ataxia, pareses of cranial nerves and extremities, dizziness, confusion, psychic instability, excit- ability, anxiety, disorientation, memory loss, and sometimes personality changes. In the CNS, the virus produces diffuse degenerative changes of neurons, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (“cuffing”) and damage to Purkinje cells. Case fatality rate in humans ranges from c. 1 % (in TBEV-W), 7– 8 % (in TBEV-S), up to 20–40 % (TBEV-FE); convales- cence is prolonged, and neurological sequellae (residua) sometimes including pareses are quite common. Major se- quelae such as atrophic paralysis of the neck and shoulder are rare in CEE (Ackermann and Rehse-Küpper 1979; Kunz 1981; Holmgren and Forsgren 1990), whereas they are relatively frequent and occasionally combined with a chron- ic and progressive course (e.g., Kozhevnikov's epilepsy, progressive neuritis of the shoulder plexus, dispersed scle- rosis, progressive muscle atrophy) in RSSE (TBEV-S: Zlotnik et al. 1976; Asher 1979; Pogodina et al. 1986; Gritsun et al. 2003). Several thousand cases of TBE are recorded in Europe each year, with considerable inter-annual variation (Korenberg and Kovalevski 1999; Gritsun et al. 2003; Petri et al. 2010). In some European countries, TBE is quite frequent: for instance, on average, 368 cases (140 to 744 in individual years) a year were reported in Czechland between 1970 and 1999, corresponding to the incidence of 4.2 (1.4–7.4) per 100,000 inhabitants, and it peaked at 1,029 patients (10.0 per 100,000) in the year 2006. In the years 2004–2007, only a few countries have had a higher incidence of TBE than Czech Republic (5.0–10.0): Slovenia 10.2–18.6, Estonia 10.4–13.5, Lithuania 6.5–13.5, Latvia 6.2–10.8, while the TBE incidence was as low as 0.6–1.2 in neighboring Austria, due to a much higher vaccination rate in that country (Mantke et al. 2008). Diagnosis: serology (ELISA, HIT, CFT, VNT), detection of IgM in early phase or seroconversion in paired serum samples; rarely used is the isolation of the virus from the blood or CSF in cell cultures (e.g., PS pig embryo kidney cells) or in mice, and detection of the virus RNA by using RT-PCR. Therapy: specific immunoglobulins can be applied to infected persons but they are only effective when inoculated immediately, i.e., within 1–2 days after infection, otherwise they could be even detrimental. Prevention and control include mapping and surveillance of natural foci of TBE, pasteurization of milk (CEE virus may persist in some dairy products at +4°C for more than 60 days: Grešíková-Kohútová 1959), protection from tick exposure (clothing, repellents), vector tick control, and vac- cination. “FSME-Immun” and “Encepur” vaccines (Loew- Baselli et al. 2011; Petri et al. 2010) consist of purified inactivated virus grown in chicken embryo cells produced by methods largely based on a study of Czech virologists (Daneš and Benda 1962). A mass vaccination campaign of Austrian population living in endemic foci led to a signifi- cant decline of TBE from 612 cases recorded in 1982 to 89 cases diagnosed in 1990 (C. Kunz, pers. comm.), and a similar 5-to-10 times decrease of TBE incidence has been reported in other European countries after frequent vaccina- tion of population. European distribution: Fig. 1 Outside Europe, TBEV occurs in the Asian part of Turkey, Asian Russia (Siberia, Far East), Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, north-eastern China, Japan, and Korean peninsula. Flavivirus louping ill (LIV) Synonym: Negishi virus. Prototype strain of LIV is LI-31. Louping-ill virus is very closely related to TBEV, in fact indistinguishable from it by conventional serological and cross-protection tests (Clarke 1962, 1964; Calisher 1988; Calisher et al. 1989; Kopecký et al. 1991; Shiu et al. 1991; Holzmann et al. 1992; Venugopal et al. 1992; Hubálek et al. 1995) and with difficulties by nucleotide sequence homology of the E gene (Gao et al. 1993; Venugopal et al. 1994; Fig. 2 in Gould et al. 2003, Fig. 3 in Weaver 2006; Grard et al. 2007, Fig. 1 in Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). LIV is antigenically and genomically much closer to CEEV than CEEV is related to RSSEV; LIV should thus not be regarded as a separate virus, in that RSSEVand CEEVare considered subtypes of one virus (TBEV). Therefore, Hubálek et al. (1995) and Grard et al. Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 13 (2007) suggested arrangement of LIV as another subtype of TBEV, and not as a separate virus. Louping-ill has long been recognized as a disease of sheep in Scotland. For instance, it was recorded in the 1795 Statis- tical Account or by Walter Scott in 1891 (Davidson et al. 1991). The virus was first isolated from sheep brain in Selkirkshire, Scotland in 1929 (prototype strain Moredun LI-31: Pool et al. 1930) and it is, in fact, the very first arthropod-borne virus isolated in Europe. Principal vector of LIV is the tick I. ricinus (MacLeod and Gordon 1932); LI is also transmissible by the goat and sheep milk (Reid et al. 1984; Reid and Pow 1985), analog- ically as the other TBEV subtypes. Vertebrate hosts are e.g., wood mouse (A. sylvaticus), common shrew (S. araneus), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), sheep, and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus: Reid 1990; Gilbert et al. 2000). LIV infection is fatal to suckling rat (i.c., i.p.), lamb (i.c., not s.c.), sometimes rhesus Fig. 1 European distribution of natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis (CEE and RSSE) and louping ill (asterisks). Explanation: black dots and black areas, TBE virus isolation or the virus disease.

(Slanted area: antibodies to TYUV) 14 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 monkey (i.c., i.n.: Zlotnik et al. 1976). No symptoms are seen in adult M. agrestis (i.c., s.c.), Cervus elaphus (s.c.), and Capreolus capreolus (s.c.), although meningoencepha- litis was demonstrated histologically in the deer (Reid et al. 1982), and LIV was isolated from a roe deer (Reid et al. 1976). LIV occasionally affects also cattle, pig (piglets), goat (kids), horse, dog, hare, and red grouse (with a mortal- ity rate of 70–80 % especially in juvenile birds: Reid et al. 1978, 1980); interestingly, the grouse chicks die when they eat infected ticks. Typical course of LI in sheep is biphasic, with fever and weakness, followed by meningoencephalitis with cerebellar ataxia, generalized tremor, jumping (to “loup” means to leap in vernacular Scottish), vigorous kick- ing, salivation, champing of jaws, progressing to paralysis, coma and death (lethality 40–60 %). The histopathology shows (sheep, pig, rhesus monkey, or mouse) a diffuse meningoencephalitis with perivascular cuffing, neuronal de- generation, and destruction of Purkinje cells, similar to TBE (Reid 1990). Concurrent tick-borne fever (Anaplasma phag- ocytophilum infection) and external stress enhance the dis- ease course (Reid 1990). Natural foci of LI are “boskematic” (pastoral: Rosický 1959)—rough, poorly drained hill pastures, heather moor- lands with bracken and moor-grass; principally a sheep-tick or sheep-tick-grouse cycle (Reid 1990; Smith and Varma 1981). Unfortunately, spring lambing on hilly pastures coin- cides with the period of peak seasonal activity of the vector in endemic foci. The human illness is usually biphasic; the febrile phase, after a short period of improvement, is followed by high fever and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, headache, weakness, stiff neck, conjunctivitis, retrobulbar pain, pho- tophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, dysarthria, excessive sweat- ing, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, drowsiness, confusion, tremors, nystagmus, and ataxia. Additional symptoms are similar to that of TBE. Nineteen naturally acquired human cases and 26 labora- tory infections with LIV have been described in Great Britain between 1934 and 1990 (Davidson et al. 1991), including one fatal encephalitis in a butcher from northern Scotland (Williams and Thorburn 1962). LIV transmission to man is obviously infrequent in the U.K. because the vector ticks only occasionally bite people in endemic areas (similarly as with Lyme borreliosis). It is primarily an oc- cupational disease, affecting shepherds, crofters, veterinary personnel, forestry workers, butchers and laboratory person- nel. However, human cases of LI with a milder symptom- atology might remain underreported. Diagnosis: as for TBE. TBE vaccine is also protective aginst LIV. Control of LI is mainly based on vaccination of sheep; the inacti- vated LI vaccine is commercially available and in gen- eral use. Tick control by dipping the sheep with residual acaricides is also practicized. The methods of environ- mental control of ticks such as pasture rotation, cutting or burning grass and bush vegetation, and drainage are effective but economically less feasible (Smith and Varma 1981). European distribution: Norway is the only country of the continental Europe where a typical LIV strain was isolated (Gao et al. 1993) (Fig. 1). LIV does not occur outside Europe. Fig. 3 European distribution of Uukuniemi (circles), Grand Arbaud (square), and Ponteves (asterisk) viruses. (Slanted area: antibodies to UUKV) Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 15 Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV) Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV) is related to the Australian Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, VNT and nucleotide sequence of the envelope gene (Marin et al. 1995), while less similar to TBEV by CFT and HIT. TYUV is a member of the Seabird tick-borne virus subgroup of tick-borne flaviviruses. The virus was first isolated from Ixodes uriae collected in nesting grounds ofUria aalge on Tyuleniy Island near Sakha- lin, Sea of Okhotsk (Asian Russia) in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1971), and simultaneously off the western U.S. coast (Clifford et al. 1971). In Europe, the agent was revealed in fact even earlier— in 1967 as “Murman” virus under similar conditions on the Kola Peninsula, northern Russia (Bekleshova et al. 1970). Principal vector is I. uriae (TST, TOT). Mosquitoes (Aedes communis, Aedes punctor, Aedes excrucians) may possibly act as secondary (or mechanical) vectors; success- ful experimental TYUV transmissions by Aedes aegypti, Culex pipiens, and Hyalomma asiaticum have been reported (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Lvov et al. 1971, 1973a, b, c, d). Vertebrate hosts are seabirds U. aalge, Eudyptula minor, and the suslikCitellus undulatus. Antibodies are often present in additional seabirds Uria lomvia, Lunda cirrhata, Frater- cula arctica, Fulmarus glacialis, Phalacrocorax urile, Phala- crocorax aristotelis, Larus argentatus, Larus fuscus, Larus marinus, Larus ridibundus, Rissa tridactyla (French coast: Chastel et al. 1985a, b), and in some mammals (Callorhinus ursinus, Alopex lagopus, Lutreola lutreola). Antibodies were detected in 22–33 % of cattle in the N.-European Russian taiga and tundra zones (Lvov et al. 1989). Animal disease is unknown, but experimentally inoculat- ed (i.c. or s.c.) birds show clinical symptoms: encephalitis with pareses and occasional death in R. tridactyla, L. argen- tatus, and U. lomvia (Berezina et al. 1974). The virus is not pathogenic to adult rabbit (i.p.). Febrile illness with adyna- mia and anorexia was observed in rhesus monkeys infected aerogenically. Natural foci of TYUVare seabird colonies on steep rocks. Three TYUV cases of febrile illness with malaise, laryn- gitis, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and skin petechiae were documented in biologists collecting samples in seabird col- onies in the Murmansk region, 1972–78 (Voinov 1978). European distribution: Fig. 2 Outside Europe TYUV occurs in Asian Russia (Far East–Sea of Okhotsk); coastal West USA (Oregon) and Canada. Migratory seabirds play a role in the exchange of TYUV complex flaviviruses be- tween the northern and southern hemispheres (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979). Flavivirus Meaban (MEAV) MEAV is a member of the Seabird tick-borne virus sub- group of tick-borne flaviviruses, Tyuleniy antigenic complex (Calisher et al. 1989). Prototype: Brest/Ar/T707 (Ornithodoros maritimus, France, 1981). Closely related to the Australian Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, HIT and even VNT (Chastel et al. 1985a, b), while more distantly related to TYUV (unrelated by VNT), TBEVand other flaviviruses. First isolated from argasid ticks collected in seagull col- onies on Méaban and Penfred islands, Brittany (France) in 1981–82 (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). Principal vector is the soft tick O. maritimus (TST). Vertebrate hosts are unknown, but antibodies have been detected in gulls L. argentatus and L. fuscus. Meningoen- cephalitis in suckling mouse caused by MEAV is character- ized by perivascular cuffing and diffuse neuronal necrosis (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). Natural foci of MEAVoccur in seabird colonies. Animal and human disease caused by MEAV has not been reported, and no antibodies toMEAVwere detected by HIT in 562 human sera collected in Brittany (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). European distribution: Fig. 2 Long-distance migratory Sterna paradisaea and Sterna hirundo terns could have contributed to the dispersal of MEAV and Saumarez Reef viruses or their common progenitor between Australia and France (Chastel et al. 1985a, b).

Vertebrate hosts are passerine birds of the genera Oriolus, Muscicapa, Sylvia, Phylloscopus, Phoenicurus, Luscinia, Chloris, and Fringilla (Balducci et al. 1973; Watson et al. 1972). Human and animal disease caused by this virus has not been reported. European distribution: central and northern Italy. Outside Europe: Egypt, Cyprus.

Jaaskelainen-2006-Siberian subtype tickborne e.pdf	"Dispatches.qxp Siberian Subtype Tickborne Encephalitis Virus, Finland Anu E. Jääskeläinen,* Tapani Tikkakoski,† Nathalie Y. Uzcátegui,* Andrey N. Alekseev,‡ Antti Vaheri,*§ and Olli Vapalahti*§¶ We isolated 11 Siberian subtype tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) strains from Ixodes persulcatus ticks from a TBEV-endemic focus in the Kokkola Archipelago, western Finland. Thus I. persulcatus and the Siberian TBEV are reported in a focus considerably northwest of their previ- ously known range in eastern Europe and Siberia. Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease endemic in azone extending from central and eastern Europe to Siberia and Japan. Three subtypes of the causative agent tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are known: the European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (1,2). The main vec- tor for the European subtype is Ixodes ricinus, and for the other 2 subtypes, I. persulcatus (1,3–5). I. ricinus is found in Europe and Middle East (6), and I. persulcatus ranges from eastern Europe to China and Japan. The boundary between their distribution lies at the Russian side of the Finnish-Russian border (1,7). The distribution areas of both tick species overlap in eastern Europe (4,5) (Figure 1). I. persulcatus has not been reported from north- ern or western Europe except for an engorged nymph on a willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) in northeastern Sweden in May 1992 (6). In Finland, the TBE-endemic areas are mostly in the coastal regions: two thirds of cases come from the Åland Islands. Other TBE-endemic regions include the Archipelago of Turku, a focus in Isosaari (an island outside Helsinki), the Lappeenranta region in southeastern Finland, and the Archipelago of Kokkola in western Finland (9). The virus was found in the same areas (except for Isosaari) as early as the 1960s by screening antibodies to TBEV from cattle sera (10). The TBE focus in the Archipelago of Kokkola (63°50'N, 23°10'E), ≈300 km south of the Arctic Circle, has a peculiar location; it is an isolated focus, far from other TBE-endemic areas, and is the northernmost TBE- endemic area known. Furthermore, the recent TBE cases have been severe with sequelae (11,12). A cluster of cases in 2002 led us to study ticks in the Kokkola Archipelago for TBEV. The Study A total of 1,181 ticks were collected by flagging in the Archipelago of Kokkola in June 2004 (Table 1). In the tick-collecting areas 1–7, TBE patients had reported tick bites, and in areas 8–10, no TBE cases have been found. All the locations were islands or peninsulas within 20 km of each other. The ticks were homogenized in pools of ≈10 with Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin (D-PBS-BSA) and sand to 122 pools. RNA was isolated from 100 µL of the pools by TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Espoo, Finland). The RNA was dissolved in 20 µL diethyl pyrocarbonate–treated water, and 10 µL was used for nested reverse transcription (RT)–PCR, amplifying a 252-nt sequence from the TBEV- NS5 gene to detect TBEV-RNA according to Puchhammer-Stöckl et al. (13), except that the outer for- ward primer used was 5′-GGAGGCTGAACAACTG- CAC-3′. TBEV-RNA was detected in 13 pools (each consisted of 10 adult ticks) (Table 1).

To isolate TBEV strains from the RT-PCR–positive tick pools, 20 µL of the supernatant of the pools diluted 1:1 in D-PBS-BSA was injected intracerebrally into suckling NMRI mice. One litter of suckling mice was used for each pool. The mice were followed for 14 days or until symp- toms of illness appeared, and then they were killed. From 200 µL of the homogenized mouse brains, diluted 1:5 with D-PBS-BSA, RNA was extracted by TriPure, and RT-PCR for the partial TBEV-E gene was performed. The cDNA was produced with the reverse primer 5′-CCYCCAGC- CARGAGRAAGC-3′ by M-MuLV-RT enzyme (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and subsequent PCR was performed with this and a forward primer 5′- AACAGGGAYTTTGTCACTGGYACTC-3′ by Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas) (detailed RT-PCR protocol avail- able from the authors upon request). A region of 205 nt from the NS5 gene from the RT- PCR–positive tick pools and 1,225-nt stretch from the E gene from the brains of the infected suckling mice were sequenced (GenBank accession nos. in Table 2). Unex- pectedly, based on the partial NS5 sequences from the RT- PCR–positive tick pools (data not shown), the TBEV strains in Kokkola belonged to the Siberian subtype of TBEV. A phylogenetic tree based on the partial E gene sequences (1,076 nt) obtained from the TBEV isolates was prepared by the maximum likelihood method (Figure 2, scripts and datasets available from the authors upon request). Within the 1,076-nt stretch of the E gene, the Kokkola strains were >99.6% identical to each other. The closest relatives were Latvia-1-96 (97% identical) and the Estonian strains Est54, Est3535, and EK328 (95%–96%). Consequently, the Siberian subtype strains isolated from Finland and nearby Baltic states form a lineage together within the Siberian subtype. Other Siberian subtype strains Vasilchenko, Aina, Zausaev, and TBEV228 showed 92%–94% identity, and the European and Far Eastern sub- types showed 84%–86% identity. However, the vector tick species for Siberian-type TBEV, I. persulcatus, was not known to exist in Finland. This knowledge led us to study the tick species more carefully. DNA was isolated from 20 tick pools by TriPure and resuspended in 100 µL of TE (Tris-HCl 10 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, pH ≈8). The tick species was determined as I. persulcatus by amplifying an average of 339 bp from mitochondrial 16S RNA gene by PCR and subsequent sequencing according to Caporale et al. (14). Because the ticks were pooled and homogenized before species identification, 30 adult ticks from the same region collected later in the summer were examined micro- scopically. All these specimens were I. persulcatus by morphologic criteria. Conclusions A TBE focus has existed in the Kokkola Archipelago at least since the 1960s when TBEV antibodies were detect- ed in cattle (10), but the local TBE viruses have not been characterized. A cluster of severe human cases in the beginning of the 2000s prompted us to carry out the pres- ent study. In June 2004, we collected 1,181 ticks from the Archipelago of Kokkola and detected TBEV-RNA in 13 pools. Eleven were also positive in virus isolation. The sequences showed that the strains belonged to the Siberian subtype, whereas in the other Finnish TBE-endemic foci, only European subtype TBEV closely related to the central European strains has previously been detected (15). Furthermore, the tick species was I. persulcatus. Our results show that both I. persulcatus and the Siberian type TBEV are occurring several hundreds of kilometers further to northwest than what has been known previously. Because the 2 tick species are similar to the naked eye and in their behavior, and published data on distribution of Ixodes ticks in Finland are sparse and outdated, we cannot exclude the possibility that I. persulcatus also exists unno- ticed elsewhere in Finland. More tick surveys and epi- demiologic studies are needed to map the distribution areas of the 2 vector species and of the different TBEV subtypes in Finland.

Some researchers have found indications that the Siberian TBEV might cause more severe or more persist- ent forms of TBE than the European subtype (4), and 3 of 5 recent human TBE cases in Kokkola have been severe (11,12). However, the number of cases studied from Kokkola is too small for firm conclusions on the severity of the local disease.

M e e n e h a n 2 Abstract: From 19,226 Culex (Eumelanomyia) rubinotus col­ lected in South Africa and Rhodesia over 3 years, 80 strains of Banzi virus, 74 of Germiston virus and 67 of Witwatersrand virus were isolated. It is concluded that the regularity of infec­ tion in different geographical areas over this period and its frequency among individuals of several different natural popula­ tions indicate that C. rubinotus is a maintenance vector of all 3 viruses. Four isolations of Arumowot virus and 2 of a Bunyam- wera-like virus were also made from C. rubinotus.

jmedent37-0965.pdf	"SHORT COMMUNICATION Detection of Dengue Virus Neutralizing Antibodies in Bats from Costa Rica and Ecuador KENNETH B. PLATT,1 JOSEPH A. MANGIAFICO,2 OSCAR J. ROCHA,3 MARIA E. ZALDIVAR,3 JOSE MORA,3 GABRIEL TRUEBA,4 AND WAYNE A. ROWLEY5 J. Med. Entomol. 37(6): 965Ð967 (2000) ABSTRACT Neutralizing antibodies for dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 and serotypes 2 and 3 were detected in 1998 in 12 of 53 (22.6%) and 3 of 10 (30.0%) bats sampled in Costa Rica and Ecuador, respectively. Dengue is a consistent health problem in the two Costa Rican communities in which bats were sampled. The high percentage of bats with neutralizing antibodies to dengue virus in these two Costa Rican communities suggests that bats may become infected with dengue virus. This appears to be the case in Costa Rica and Ecuador. KEY WORDS Aedes aegypti, bats, dengue virus, neutralizing, antibodies DENGUE HAS EMERGED during the past 30 yr as the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans throughout the tropical and semitropical regions of the world (Gubler, 1997). Aedes aegypti (L.) is the principle vector of dengue virus (DEN) in Central America where epidemics characteristically occur during the rainy season (May throughOctober). Clin- ical manifestations of the disease vary from mild to severe febrile conditions and on occasion are charac- terized by plasma leakage and shock with a case mor- tality rate as high as 10%. In areas not populated with people DEN is maintained by transovarial transmis- sion in several species of Aedes mosquitoes with non- human primates serving as amplifying reservoirs (Cordellier et al. 1983, Rosen et al. 1983, Hull et al. 1984, Gubler et al. 1985). Little is known about the maintenance of DEN in populated areas during in- terepidemic periods, which are characteristically dry. Ae. aegypti populations survive during these dry pe- riods as eggs. Transovarial transmission of DEN in Ae. aegypti is apparently inefÞcient and no animal reser- voirs of DEN have been identiÞed in urban areas (Gubler 1987).OÕConnor andRowan (1955) detected dengue protective antibody in a small population of ßying foxes of the suborder, Megachiroptera, in Aus- tralia and suggested that these animals could serve as an interepidemic reservoir for DEN. More recently, Price (1978) reported the presence of hemagglutina- tion inhibition (HI) antibodies to DEN-2 in 126 of 857 bats that represented several species in Trinidad. The speciÞcityof theseHIantibodieswasnotconÞrmedby neutralization. Consequently the signiÞcance of HI antibodies in the bat population of Trinidad is not known. In the current study serological evidence is presented that suggests that bats of the suborder Mi- crochiroptera may be infected with dengue virus in urban areas. Serums were collected from 49 fruit-eating bats of the genera, Artibeus, Uroderma, and Carollia and four free-tailed bats of the genus Molossus in June 1998 in and around the cities of Puntarenas and Liberia in Costa Rica. Active outbreaks of dengue were occur- ring in thesecommunities at the time that serumswere collected from bats. Annual outbreaks of dengue are common in both communities following the start of the rainy season, and all four serotypes of DEN have been isolated frompatients in these cities over thepast 6 yr (Saenz et al. 1999). Serums were also collected from nine fruit-eating bats in the genera Artibeus and Uroderma and from a single vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus (E. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire), in Tena, Ecuador, in August 1998. Information on the prevalence of den- gue in the human population of Tena is not available. Serums were tested by the constant virusÐvarying serum plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (MangiaÞco et al. 1988) against DEN-1 (Hawaii), DEN-2 (S16803), DEN-3 (CH53489), and DEN-4 (CAR341750) viruses. Brießy, each virus, diluted to contain '100 plague forming units (PFU)/0.1 ml was mixed with an equal volume of serial fourfold diluted test serum and held overnight at 48C. The next day the mixtures were inoculated into duplicate 23-mm wells (0.1 ml/well) containing a conßuent monolayer of LLC-MK2 cells. Plates with inoculated wells were incubated for 1 h at 378C with 5% CO2 and overlaid with nutrient medium with 1% agar, 5% fetal bovine serum, 200 U penicillin/ml and 200 mg streptomycin/ ml. Plates were held at 378C with 5% CO2 for '72 h.

Plates were returned to 378C and 5% CO2 and checked daily until visible plaques were countable. The neutralizing antibody titer was considered positive at the highest serum dilution that inhibited 80% of the plaques com- pared with the virus control titration. End points at a Þnal serum dilution of 1:20 or higher were considered positive. The PRNT80 titers of bat serums are summa- rized in Tables 1 and 2. Serums from 12 of the 53 bats (22.6%) sampled in Costa Rica neutralized dengue virus. Six of these 12 serums with PRNT80 titers ranging from 20 to 40 only neutralized DEN-1. Three of the 12 serums with PRNT80 titers of 20 only reacted with DEN-2. Two of the remaining three serums from Costa Rican bats with PRNT80 titers of 80 and 40 for DEN-1 also had PRNT80 titers of 20 for DEN-2. These polytypic reac- tions suggest sequential infection in these bats with different DEN serotypes. A sufÞcient quantity of the last of the 12 seropositive serums was only available to test for neutralizing activity against DEN-2. No neu- tralizing activity speciÞc for DEN-3 or 24 was de- tected in the serums of any of 53 Costa Rican bats that were sampled. Serums from 3 of 10 bats (30%) sampled in Ecuador had neutralizing activity against dengue virus. One of these three serums with a PRNT80 titer of 40 neutral- ized DEN-2 but not DEN-1 or -3. A sufÞcient amount of serum was not available to test this serum for neu- tralizing activity against DEN-4. The remaining two serums from Ecuadorian bats had PRNT80 titers of 80 for DEN-2, and PRNT80 titers of 80 and 20 for DEN-3. Neither of these two serums neutralized DEN-1 or DEN-4. Neutralizing activity against dengue virus was de- tected primarily in bats of the genera Artibeus and Uroderma that comprised 87.3% of the total number (63) of bats sampled. Antibody was also detected in two of four Molossus species. No antibody was de- tected in a single vampirebat or threeCarollia species. No neutralizing activity was detected against yellow fever virus, (the type species ßavivirus), in the serums of any of the 15 Costa Rican and Ecuadorian bats that neutralized dengue virus. Thesedata indicate that serumsof someCostaRican and Ecuadorian bats neutralized dengue virus. It may be possible that a ßavivirus other than dengue virus induced this neutralizing activity. However, this is unlikely. This opinion is based Þrst on the fact that dengue virus constitutes its own antigenic complex within the Flaviviridae based on cross neutralization assayswithpolyclonal antiserums(Calisher et al. 1989, Monath and Heinz 1995) The DEN complex is anti- genically distinct from seven other complexes includ- ing the Rio Bravo and the Japanese encephalitis virus antigenic complexes. These two antigenic complexes represent, respectively, the Rio Bravo virus that is ubiquitous in insectivorous bats of the neotropics, and Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus that has been shown to be capable of infecting the bat, Eptesicus fuscus(PolisotdeBeauvois)(Herboldet al. 1983).The Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus, which is too antigenically distinct to include in any of the eight antigenic complexes, has also been isolated from bats in the Western Hemisphere. Secondly, the neutraliz- ing activity of high titer immune serum to DEN sero- types is monotypic (Calisher et al. 1989). In the cur- rent study, the neutralizing activity of 10 of the seropositive bat serumswith PRNT80s ranging from20 to 40 was monotypic. In addition, the two bat serums that neutralized DEN-1 and -2 did not neutralize DEN-3 or -4, and the two bat serums that neutralized DEN-2 and -3 did not neutralize DEN-1 or -4 (Table 2). If the neutralizing activity observed in these bat serums had been induced by a closely related ßavivi- rus it seems likely that a broader polytypic response to DEN serotypes would have been observed. Currently humans and mosquitoes are considered to be the only hosts involved in the epidemiology of dengue. However, the relatively large number (22.6%) of bats with neutralizing antibodies for den- guevirus inLiberia andPuntarenas,CostaRica,where human dengue is common, implicate them as possible hosts for these viruses. Bats in these areas often roost in houses and abandoned buildings during the day in close proximity to the endophilic and diurnal Ae. ae- Table 1.

This mosquito is anthropohilic but is also op- portunistic and will feed on a variety of other animals including bats. We recently conÞrmed in the labora- tory that Ae. aegypti from Puntarenas readily feeds on bats. Thirty-four percent of 366 femalemosquitoes fed to repletion on two bats within 20 min (W.A.R. and K.B.P., unpublished data). A recent survey of mosqui- toes in Costa Rica (O.J.R., W.A.R, M.E.Z. and K.B.P., unpublished data) found that between 55 and 100% of homes in Liberia and Puntarenas had breeding pop- ulations of Ae. aegypti during the rainy season. Several of these homes were constructed in such a manner as to provide roosting spaces for bats that would be accessible to feeding Ae. aegypti. In the same study, Rocha et al. were unable to isolate any viruses by intercerebral inoculation of suckling mice, from 30 different species of mosquitoes collected in and around homes in Costa Rican cities. Only a few Ae. aegyptiwere represented in thesepools because of the difÞculty of collecting this species in dry ice baited CDC light traps. An inability to isolate any ßavivirus including SLE, from peridomestic mosquitoes further supports our contention thatdenguevirus induced the antibodies found in bats. The high seroprevalence of dengue virus-speciÞc antibody in urban populations of bats suggests that bats as well as humans may become infected with DEN. Epidemiological studies are underway in Costa Rica to conÞrm the presence of DEN in neotropical bat populations. If dengue has a mosquito-bat cycle in Costa Rica and Ecuador, knowledge of the mosquito- bat-virus association will be important to further our understanding of the transmission and natural history of this disease in the Americas.

Entebbe bat virus (ENTV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), closely related to yellow fever virus, was first isolated from a little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) in Uganda in 1957, but was not detected after that initial isolation. In 2011, we isolated ENTV from a little free-tailed bat captured from the attic of a house near where it had originally been found. Infectious virus was recovered from the spleen and lung, and the viral RNA was sequenced and compared with that of the original isolate. Across the polypeptide sequence, there were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in 97.8% identity at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates. Further study of this virus would provide valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and transmission of bat- and mosquito- borne flaviviruses. Bat virus investigations in Uganda were initially inspired in the mid-1950s by the isolations of rabies virus and a novel flavivirus, later to become known as Rio Bravo virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), from the salivary glands of insec- tivorous bats in the United States.1–3 Subsequently, investi- gators at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) collected bats from the attic of UVRI, dissected salivary glands, and isolated viruses by intracerebral inoculation of triturated salivary gland extracts into neonatal mice.4,5 This first effort resulted in the isolation of Entebbe bat salivary gland virus, strain IL-30 (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) from a little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) (Cretzchmar).4,5 The taxon was then recognized by one of its synonyms: Tadarida (Chaerephon) limbata (Peters). Lumsden and others4,5 determined that this isolate was a novel flavivirus through a series of neutralization tests using immune sera against 20 arboviruses as well as against Rio Bravo virus. By 1964, bat virus research had expanded at UVRI, and sampling of 1,022 additional bats yielded 14 strains of viruses including Dakar bat virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) also from little free-tailed bats, and Bukalasa bat virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) from Angolan free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus) (A. Smith).6 Isolation of Mount Elgon bat virus (Rhabdoviridae: Ledantevirus) followed shortly thereafter from an eloquent horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hildebrandtii eloquens) (K. Anderson) captured in Kenya, with the virus being isolated and charac- terized at UVRI.7,8 Additional bat virus discoveries in Uganda later included Kasokero virus (Bunyaviridae, unassigned) from an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (E. Geoffroy).9 Entebbe bat virus (ENTV, renamed), Bukalasa bat virus, and Dakar bat virus were all isolated from insectivorous bats captured in the attic of UVRI.10 Serological surveys suggested that the infection prevalence of ENTV in wild populations of little free-tailed bats was high, but ENTV was never isolated again after the original discovery.10,11 To follow up on these early studies, arbovirus surveil- lance of bats was conducted in Uganda from 2011 to 2013. Bats were captured from attics in several locations around Entebbe and Kampala as part of a larger, country-wide sam- pling effort to be reported elsewhere. All bat captures were conducted under the approval of CDC/DVBD IACUC pro- tocol 010-015. Bats were captured in attics using mist nets, taking appropriate biosafety precautions. On capture, bats were placed individually in cloth holding bags. Bats were anesthetized with halothane, exsanguinated by cardiac punc- ture, and euthanized by halothane overdose and cervical dis- location. Blood from bats was collected directly into serum separator tubes, centrifuged in the field, and placed immedi- ately in a nitrogen dry vapor shipper. Liver, spleen, heart, lung, and kidney were all collected directly into cryovials and stored immediately on dry ice. In total, 95 little free- tailed bats and 34 Angolan free-tailed bats were captured in 2011, 15 little free-tailed bats in 2012, and 70 little free-tailed bats in 2013. Virus isolation was attempted first from spleens, and on a positive result, virus isolation was also performed from the remaining tissues harvested from the infected bat. A single virus was isolated from 1 of 180 (0.5%) little free-tailed bats. The infected bat was an adult male, captured in Banga, Nakiwogo (0°04.884′ N, 32°27.030′ E) on June 23, 2011, near UVRI. Infectious virus was isolated from the spleen and lung; no infectious virus was recovered from the heart, liver, or kidney. No other tissues, oral or fecal swabs were col- lected from the insectivorous bats captured in 2011. The isolate was initially identified as ENTV by sequencing of the flavivirus NS5 amplicon using primers FU2/CFD3,12 fol- lowed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Virus isola- tions, nucleic acid preparations, and NGS were performed as described previously.13 Novel primers were designed from contigs generated from the NGS data using Primer 3 software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA)14 (Supplemental Table 1), and the sequence for the entire genome was confirmed by direct sequencing. End ter- minal sequences were obtained using 5′/3′ RACE (FirstChoice® RLM-RACE, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus-specific RACE primers are provided in Supplemental Table 1. The 5′ outer reaction used primer 514R in combination with the 5′ RACE outer primer. The 5′ RACE inner reactions used primer 388R together with the 5′ RACE inner primer; amplification was also achieved with primers 15F + 388R. The 3′ outer reaction used either primer 9882F or 10328F in combination with the 3′ RACE outer primer. The 3′ inner RACE was not successful. *Address correspondence to Rebekah C.

E-mail: rcmosquito@ gmail.com 475 A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA version 6.015 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) using 10,493 nucleotides spanning the open reading frame sequence of select flavivirus genomes available in GenBank (Figure 1). The analy- sis was performed using a complete deletion substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. In total, 10,663 nucleotides of the ENTV genome were obtained (GenBank Accession number KP233893), of which the polypeptide is encoded between nucleotides 120 and 10,355. Kuno and Chang16 published the only other existing ENTV genome (DQ837641) sequenced from the original IL-30 strain. Compared with that original sequence, we report an additional 153 nucleotides in the 3′ noncoding region, but also experienced difficulty in obtaining the complete 3′ ter- minal sequence.16 Across the polypeptide sequence, there were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in 97.8% identity at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates. Before sequencing, the 1957 isolate had been passaged in suckling mouse brain, but the earlier passage history is unclear; the 2011 isolate was passaged twice in Vero cells. This 2.2% amino acid divergence is within the range that has been observed for other flaviviruses with isolations ranging between 1 and 49 years apart,17–19 indicating relatively little change in the ENTV genome in 54 years since the first isolation. Every gene had at least one amino acid change except for PrM and M (Table 1). The highest percent divergence between the two isolates was in NS4A, 10.3% (Table 1). NS4A is a small, multifunctional, hydrophobic protein that plays a role in modulating the host’s type I interferon response.20 It has also been shown to associate with host cellular vimentin during dengue virus replication to stabilize the replication complex.21 The functional significance of this high percentage of amino acid divergence has yet to be determined, but Hahn and others22 surmised that a large number of amino acid sub- stitutions could be accommodated among the small, hydro- phobic polypeptides NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B so long as the hydrophobicity profile remained unchanged. In this case, changes to the NS4A hydrophobicity profile between these two isolates were inconsequential. Two of the 76 amino acid changes occurred at the junctions of NS2A/NS2B, and at NS4A/2K. The lengths of all of the genes were identical to those previously reported.16 The phylogenetic relationship between ENTV and yellow fever virus (YFV) is very interesting, as YFV is historically one of the most medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Although ENTV falls phylogenetically within the mosquito- borne flaviviruses and historically has been placed in the YFV group,16,23 it has only been isolated twice from bats (1957 and 2011) and never from wild-caught mosquitoes or humans.

ENTV also replicates in mosquito cells.26 Despite remaining an obscure bat-associated virus for over a half century, ENTV continues to circulate among little free-tailed bats in Uganda. Further study of this virus would provide valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and transmission of bat-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus was detected in samples by reverse transcriptase (RT)-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), after which TBEV- positive samples were inoculated into BHK-21 cells and suckling mice. Tick-borne encephalitis virus genes were detected in 4 of 38 tick pools and 5 of 24 wild rodents. Suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally with TBEV-pos- itive rodent samples showed signs of encephalitis at six days post-inoculation. The isolation of TBEV was con- firmed by inoculating samples obtained from the brains of sick mice in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the E genes of the TBEV isolates were clustered with the Western subtype (98% identity). This study suggests the possible occurrence of tick-borne encephalitis in Korea. Key Words: Tick-borne encephalitis virus—Isolation— Rodents—Ixodes—RT-nested PCR—Cell culture—South Korea. 7 INTRODUCTION THE TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS (TBEV) isa member of the genus Flavivirus, and one of the major arboviruses causing thousands of cases of severe neurological disease (Chiba et al. 1999). Three genetic subtypes of TBEV, the Western, Far Eastern, and Siberian subtypes, are prevalent on the Eurasian continent (Ecker et al. 1999, Hayasaka et al. 1999, Heinz et al. 1981, Ternovoi et al. 2003). The tick vectors of the TBEV parasitize wild and domestic mam- mals, birds, and reptiles. Rodents are the main- tenance and amplifying hosts for most TBEVs, and the genera Apodemus and Clethrionomys are the main reservoir hosts (Perkins et al. 2003, Süss 2003). Although tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has not been reported in Korea, the num- ber of patients with encephalitis caused by un- known agents is increasing each year. Tick- borne encephalitis viruses have been isolated from vectors or rodents in countries near Ko- rea, including Japan, China, and Russia (Hou et al. 1997, Takashima et al. 1997, Ternovoi et al. 2003). Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus, the main vectors of TBEV, have been recorded in Korea since 1940. However, I. ricinus recorded from Hamgyeongbuk-do Province, in the north part of Korea, might be misidentification of I. persulcatus, so it has been accepted that this species should not be recorded as distributed in Korea and Japan (Kang et al. 1985, Yamaguti et al. 1971). In Korea, the genus Ixodes has been known as a vector for Borrelia spp. and Bar- tonella spp. (Kim et al. 2005a, Park et al. 1994). To investigate whether the TBEVs circulate in 1Division of Arboviruses and 3Division of Malaria & Parasitic Diseases, Center for Immunology & Pathology, Na- tional Institute of Health, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and 2Department of Parasitology, Col- lege of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

We were able to isolate the virus from wild rodents, and our results provide the first evidence of the presence of TBEV in Korea. These findings should prompt epidemiological study to search for possible TBE patients in the Korean population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ticks and mammalian hosts We tested ticks H. longicornis (n � 548) and I. nipponensis (n � 87), and lungs or spleens of striped field mouse A. agrarius (n � 24) and wild boar (n � 16). Ticks were removed from wild boars captured in the Dongducheon re- gion of Gyeonggi-do and collected by flagging in the Jeongseon region of Gangwon-do. Wild rodents were collected in the Hapcheon region of Gyeongsangnam-do and the Gurye region of Jeonrabuk-do. Ticks (1 to 20 ticks/pool) and lungs or spleens of wild animals were homog- enized in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), and penicillin (500 IU/mL) and strep- tomycin (500 �g/mL) (GIBCO). The homoge- nates were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 10 min, and the pellet used to extract RNA (Table 1). RT-nested PCR RNA was extracted from the homogenates of host samples and ticks using a viral RNA ex- traction kit (iNtRON, Korea) according to the manufacturer instructions. The cDNA synthesis and the first PCR to detect the E gene of TBEV were carried out with a Maxime RT-PCR Pre- Mix Kit (iNtRON) and the primers previously reported (Ternovoi et al 2003). One-step RT- nested PCR was conducted in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp® PCR system 2700, Applied Biosys- tems, USA) under the following conditions: 30 minutes at 45°C; 5 minutes at 94°C; 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 52°C, and 1 minute at 72°C (25 cycles), with a final extension step of 5 min- utes at 72°C. Nested PCR was carried out with an i-StarMaster mix PCR Kit (iNtRON) with an initial denaturation of 2 minutes at 94°C, 20 sec- onds at 94°C, 10 seconds at 62°C, and 20 seconds at 68°C (30 cycles), with a final extension step of 5 minutes at 70°C. To confirm their identities, PCR products were purified with a QIAquick purification kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and cloned into the pGEM-T cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Each of the plasmid clones was purified with a Purelink™ Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Virus isolation The samples that were positive for the E gene in the RT-nested PCR were inoculated both on a monolayer of BHK-21 cells (ATCC No. CCL- 10) and in suckling mice (ICR strain) in Earle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% antibiotics in a 25 mL culture flask, and incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for 96 hours. Cell culture su- pernatants were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and RT-nested PCR to detect the TBEV antigen and gene, respectively. Suckling mice were inoculated with 0.02 mL of the ho- mogenates and supernatants and observed for 20 days thereafter. The brains of mice that de- KIM ET AL.8 TABLE 1.

Immunofluorescence assay Cells inoculated with homogenates positive for the E gene of TBEV were treated with 0.05% trypsin–EDTA in PBS at 72 hours post-incuba- tion and cultured on 24-well glass slides sus- pended in EMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% antibiotics. After 4 hours of incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37°C, the infected cells were fixed with 80% acetone and subjected to IFA. The fixed slide was incubated for 30 minutes with primary antibody, rabbit hyper- immune antiserum against TBEV-Neudoerfl strain (JENO Biotech, Korea). After incubation, the slides were washed twice for 10 minutes with sterilized PBS. After washing, each slide was incubated for 30 minutes with the addi- tion of secondary antibody, FITC-conjugated AffiniPure Goat-anti Rabbit IgG (Jackson Im- munoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted with Evans blue (1:10,000 in PBS). The result of the IFA reaction was observed by fluorescence microscopy (�400, Axioskop2 plus, ZEISS, Switzerland). Electron microscopy The TBEV isolate and strain Sofjin-Ho were cultured in 150 cm2 culture flasks. After 96 hours of incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37°C, the cells were frozen and thawed three times. The TBEV cells were concentrated through a 30% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation at 103,745g for 2 hours at 4°C (SW28, Beckman, USA). The pellets were then suspended in 1 mL Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 13,400g for 90 min at 4°C (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 R, USA). Re-suspended pellets were stained with 3% uranyl acetate on a carbon cop- per-coated grid (200 mesh, SPI supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) and examined with an elec- tron microscope (JEM-1010, Japan). Analysis of nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic tree Nucleotide sequences of TBEV isolates were analyzed by BLASTN and aligned with DNA star (Lasergene version 5.0) and ClustalW (ver- sion 1.6) for comparison with other reported TBEV strains.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA (version 3.1) by unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic means (UPGMA) distance method (Kumar et al. 2004). RESULTS Detection of the E gene of TBEV and clinical sings in mice Four of 38 tick pools from Dongducheon and Jeongseon, and five of 24 wild rodents from Hapcheon and Gurye were positive for the E gene of TBEV by PCR. Nine PCR-positive sam- ples, four tick pools and five rodent samples, were injected intracerebrally into SMB (suck- ling mouse brain). At six days after inoculation, two mice inoculated with rodent samples de- veloped signs of encephalitis. However, mice inoculated with tick samples did not show any clinical symptoms during the experimental pe- riod. Two viruses from the Hapcheon region were successfully isolated from mice showing encephalitis, but one sample from the Gurye re- gion failed to grow from the brain preparation (Fig. 1, Table 3). All clones were specific for TBEV by sequence analysis. Antigenic and morphological identification of the Korean TBEV To detect TBEV antigen, we inoculated brain material of five rodent samples onto individual BHK-21 cell monolayers. We detected TBEV antigen in two samples by IFA. The labeled in- fected cells for one of the isolates are shown in Figure 2. Tick-borne encephalitis virus particles of isolate (KrM 219) by EM showed the typical TBEV morphology (Fig. 3).

The Korean isolates showed clustering with the Western subtype (98%–99%) but not with the Far Eastern sub- type (84%–87%) (data not shown). The Korean isolates formed a cluster with 100% bootstrap support to strain 263 and Neudoerfl (Fig. 4). DISCUSSION The aim of the present study was to deter- mine whether TBEV is present in tick vectors and wild animals in Korea. Arthropod-borne diseases have been spreading rapidly through- out the world because of increased travel and changes in the natural environment induced by global warming (Elisabet 1998, Patz et al. 1996). In Korea, there is molecular evidence that tick- borne diseases such as Q-fever, Lyme disease, rickettsial disease, ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis, and babesiosis are transmitted by I. persulcatus, I. nipponensis, and Apodemus agrarius (Cho et al. 1995, Chung et al. 2005, Ternovoi et al. 2003, Park et al. 2001, Shim et al. 1992, Stanka et al. 2005). Tick-borne encephalitis had been sus- pected to be prevalent because of the distribu- tion of a major vector, I. persulcatus, in Korea (Kang et al. 1985). More than 850 tick species exist throughout the world. Five species of Ixodes (I. ricinus, I. persulcatus, I. hexagonus, I. ar- boricola, and I. ovatus), three species of Haema- physalis (H. puntata, H. concinna, and H. inermis), and two species of Dermacentor (D. margiantus, and D. reticulatus) have been reported as vec- tors of TBEV, and as vectors for other impor- tant pathogens in both human and veterinary medicine (Elisabet 1998, Suss 2003).

We detected TBEV genes in three pools of H. longicornis and in one pool of I. nipponensis. These two species have not been recorded pre- viously as vectors for TBEV. However, they are the dominant species in Korea, and several hu- man tick bite cases involving both species have been reported there (Chung et al. 2006, Noh 1983, Lee et al. 1997). H. longicornis is impor- tant medically because it is a predominant species in human and veterinary medicine in Korea, Japan, and China (Hoogstraal et al. 1968, Kim et al. 2005a). The positive ratio of E gene of TBEV in tick and rodent samples was 0.6% and 16.6%, respectively. In our in vivo analy- sis, only mice inoculated with some of the ro- dent samples showed neurological symptoms. We do not know whether the virus titer of TBEV in the ticks was too low to cause clinical signs in mice. Most TBEVs use rodents as main- tenance and amplifying hosts, and probably as reservoir hosts, mainly in the genera Apodemus and Clethrionomys (Perkins et al. 2003, Suss 2003). The detection of TBEV in lung samples of a Korean dominant rodent, A. agrarius, sug- gests that TBEV may be maintained in other wild mammals in Korea (Chung et al. 2006). Our result showing 98% identity with the West- ern subtype differs from our prediction that the isolates would be of the Far Eastern subtype because TBEVs isolated in neighboring coun- tries such as Russia, Japan, and China are clas- sified into the Far Eastern subtype. This sug- gests that the existence of other subtypes of TBEV should be determined in domestic vec- tors and clinical samples in Korea. Our results are consistent with our previous studies in which we detected TBEVs in I. nipponensis, H. flava, and H. longicornis showing subtypes ge- netically related to the Western subtype (Kim et al. 2005b). Why TBE has not been reported in Korea may be explained by the natural en- vironmental conditions of forests in Korea, which differ from the TBEV-endemic areas in other parts of Asia and in Europe. In addition, Korea does not now have a private diagnostic laboratory with biosafety level 3 facilities to handle TBEV for providing an accurate diag- nosis (CDC, 1999). To our knowledge, this study is the first to isolate TBEV from wild ro- dents collected in Korea. Our data also suggest that the subtype distribution of TBEV is related to geography, and that species and biology of the tick vector may differ according to the ge- ographical area. In addition, it is necessary to confirm the existence of TBEV in other vectors and patients, and to compare their sequences with previous species isolated. Finally, a method for the accurate and prompt diagnosis of TBEV should be devel- oped to study the occurrence of TBE and to pre- pare a preventive plan to counter an outbreak. More research is needed to identify the infec- tion route of TBEV in nature because there are several reservoir hosts for the vector of TBEV.

D. Kramer1,∗ and L. J. Chandler2 1Center for Vector-borne Disease Research, University of California, Davis, California, U.S.A. 2Center for Tropical Diseases, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, U.S.A. Accepted July 9, 2001 Summary. The complete nucleotide sequences of the envelope gene of 62 geographic isolates of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus were determined. Phy- logenetic analyses of the sequences, conducted using both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, included four other members of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup. The results indicated that the SLE isolates formed a monophyletic group in which isolates generally clustered according to geographic origin. Isolates from Panama and South America predominantly formed two large groupings, while isolates from the U.S. formed two other major groups. Several South and Central American strains were more closely related to strains isolated in the U.S., e.g., one isolate from Mexico and Panama, each, were closely related to two Tampa Bay, Florida, isolates, and an isolate from Brazil was closely re- lated to three isolates from Texas. The U.S. isolates also were not strictly grouped according to geographic source, e.g., some California isolates were closely re- lated to Texas or midwestern isolates, and a Florida isolate was closely related to three isolates from Maryland. The results of the phylogenetic analyses indicated that SLE virus is predominantly maintained locally, but has been transported occasionally between areas, both within and outside the U.S. Introduction St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. The causative agent, SLE virus, is a member of the family Flaviviridae, in the genus ∗Current address: Arbovirus Research Laboratory, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, 5668 State Farm Rd, Slingerlands, NY 12159, U.S.A. 2342 L. D. Kramer and L. J. Chandler Flavivirus. The genome of the flaviviruses is single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, approximately 10,800 nucleotides long and composed of one open reading frame [7]. The structural proteins are located at the 5′ end of the genome; the non- structural genes, involved in viral replication, at the 3′ end of the genome in the order 5′-C-PrM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3′. SLE virus is a member of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) serocomplex, with other important human pathogens such as Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), West Nile (WN) and JE viruses, and is the only member of this serocomplex that is enzootic in the United States (U.S.), with the probable exception of the recently introduced WN virus. SLE virus is widely distributed throughout theAmericas, having been isolated in Canada, U.S., Mexico [11], Central and South America and the Caribbean [1, 3, 12, 14, 15, 26]. In the U.S., SLE occurs in both endemic and epidemic forms, and cases occur annually [5]. A small number of human cases of SLE have been reported in Central and South America [14, 20, 32], but no large outbreaks in the region have been attributed to this virus [32]. SLE virus is maintained and amplified in the U.S. by horizontal transmission in a primary enzootic cycle involving wild birds, primarily passeriformes and columbiformes [37], and Culex mosquitoes [31, 38]. In the eastern states, two Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes, Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, are the primary vectors [19]. In these areas, SLE virus occurs in both urban and suburban areas. In contrast, in the western U.S., SLE virus occurs more frequently in rural settings, especially in heavily irrigated areas where the primary vector, Culex tarsalis, breeds. A third distinct SLE cycle occurs in Florida, where Culex nigripalpus is the primary vector [19]. Less is known of the natural transmission cycle in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America, where the virus has been isolated from Culex species, including Cx. tarsalis, Cx. pipiens, and Cx. nigripalpus [19, 34], as well as other genera, including Mansonia, Haemagogus and Sabethes. Birds are presumed to be the primary vertebrate host in the cycle, but conclusive studies have not been conducted. In South America, there are a number of isolates from mammals other than man, includingCalomysmusculinus, Mus musculis, Akodon sp, Didelphis marsupialis [22, 23], but it is not known whether these are dead-end or amplification hosts. Several studies of both urban and rural forms of SLE have shown recur- rence of transmission of the virus in a single geographic area, e.g., in Texas [18], and California [30] suggesting that virus is maintained locally from year to year, [25]. Phylogenetic analysis of isolates from the San Joaquin Valley of California over ≥34 years also indicated local persistence of virus [16], although the mechanism(s) by which the virus cycle is maintained during periods when active transmission is not detected is not known. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of SLE virus over adverse seasons and years [29] including: 1) local maintenance in arthropod vectors either through vertical transmission or persistence in diapausing adults; 2) alternate arthropod vectors, such as mites, [18, 21, 28]; 3) reactivation of virus in chronically infected verte- brate hosts; 4) maintenance in alternate vertebrate hosts, such as bats [2]; and SLE virus phylogeny 2343 5) annual reintroduction of the virus from tropical and subtropical areas by migratory birds [25]. Epidemiological and experimental evidence has suggested the existence of strains of SLE virus with distinct biological differences [37]. Strains of the virus have been identified that differ in several phenotypic characteristics that may im- pact transmission and disease potential of the virus, including neurovirulence, ability to cause viremia in birds, and mosquito infectivity [4, 24, 35]. Limited genetic studies of selected strains, using oligonucleotide fingerprinting (ONF), demonstrated that viremia and neurovirulence correlated strongly with ONF pat- terns and with geographic origin of the virus strains [35]. Little is known of the specific viral molecular determinants that contribute to the epidemiology of SLE virus. Preliminary genetic analysis using ONF indicates that enzootic strains of the virus are distinct from strains isolated during epidemics [35]; however, phy- logenetic analyses of the envelope region of isolates from years of high and low activity in California and Texas revealed no consistent differences [16]. To further study the genetic variation of SLE virus and to clarify whether the virus is being transported between tropical and temperate America, the complete nucleotide sequence of the envelope gene was determined for 62 strains from different parts of the Americas. The envelope protein of the flaviviruses contains the major neutralizing epitopes, and is responsible for the important viral functions such as binding to cellular receptors, membrane fusion, virulence and tropism [26]. Because of the essential biological functions of the envelope protein, we chose to examine genetic variation of this portion of the genome. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to examine the genetic relatedness of the isolates, and to determine if the virus is maintained locally, or if movement of the virus has occurred across large geographic areas. Materials and methods Virus strains The SLE virus isolates used in this study were obtained from the University of Texas Med- ical Branch’s Arbovirus Reference Center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Arbovirus Reference Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, the Texas Department of Health in Austin, the Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services Department in Houston, Texas, the Center for Vector-borne Disease Research, University of California, Davis, and the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory of the State Health Laboratory of California. A total of 62 strains from different geographic locations in the U.S., Mexico, Caribbean, and Central and South America were sequenced in this study. A list of the isolates, including their strain designation, source, passage history and geographic origin, along with the GenBank submission numbers, is presented in Table 1. An additional 18 strains from California which previously had been sequenced [16], were re-analyzed in a phylogenetic analysis with strains from Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. RNA extraction Vero cells were infected with 0.1 PFU/cell SLE virus. When cytopathic effects were evident (4–7 days postinfection), RNA was extracted from the cells using TrizolTM (Gibco Life Sciences, MD) and resuspended in sterile dH2O. 2344 L. D. Kramer and L. J.

The envelope gene extends from base 963 to 2465 on the SLE virus genome. The sequence of SLE strain MSI-7 (GenBank Accession No. M16614) [36] was scanned using the computer software program MacVector (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT), in order to design two primers desig- nated F880 and B2581 (B2586 for the Central and South American isolates) to amplify the entire E gene of the virus. A single product, approximately 1700 base pairs in size, was obtained using these primers. Seven internal primers were designed for direct sequencing of the PCR product. The sequence and location of all the primers on the genome are presented in Table 2. PCR products were purified using QIATM PCR purification kits (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). DNA was directly sequenced using the DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequence kits (Ap- plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the UTMB Molecular Imaging and Sequencing Core Facility and the UC Davis Plant Genetics Facility. Sequences were edited using the Se- quencher program (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). After editing, the sequences were all trimmed to 1617 bp in length, representing bases 924–2540 on the genome. This included the entire envelope gene, with an additional 39 bases 5′ to the envelope and 75 bases 3′ to the envelope. Sequences were aligned using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Phylogenetic analysis The sequences of four related flaviviruses, JE (Accession # M55506) [27]; WN (M12294) [6]; Kunjin (D00246) [9], and MVE (X03467) [10] were obtained from GenBank and used as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis. For phylogenetic analyses, the PAUP version 4b [33] and PHYLIP version 3.5c package [13] software programs were used. Bootstrapping was performed using 1000 replicates in both parsimony and distance analyses. For parsimony analysis, the heuristic search option, with random addition of sequences, was used. The PHYLIP package was used for distance analysis, using the neighbor-joining and parsimony algorithms. A distance matrix was prepared to determine the nucleotide sequence divergence among the strains. SLE virus phylogeny 2347 Nucleotide sequence accession numbers The nucleotide sequences of all of the virus isolates examined in this study were submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers are listed in Table 1. Results Phylogenetic analysis of the entire envelope gene The first set of analyses included the sequence of 1617 nucleotides encompassing the entire envelope gene (bases 963 to 2465 on the genome), and determined phylogenetic relationships among 62 strains of SLE virus and four related flavi- viruses, JE, MVE, Kunjin and West Nile viruses, which were included as out- group viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both parsimony and distance-based (neighbor-joining) methods. A distance matrix was prepared to examine the genetic distance between isolates. There was a minimum of 21% and a maximum of 30% nucleotide differ- ence between the SLE strains and the four outgroup viruses. Among SLE strains alone, there was a maximum of 10% [161] nucleotide differences. The two iso- lates from Argentina, CorAn9124 and CorAn9275 from 1966 and 1967, were the most distantly related; these strains had 161 and 160 nucleotide differences, respectively, from other SLE isolates. Using the PAUP program, 80 equally parsi- monious trees were generated, all with strong bootstrap values. These trees were robust and similar in topology, differing only in the relationships between six strains (SPAn9398, GHA3, PanAn902602 and three of the older Texas isolates). The neighbor-joining tree was similar to the 80 trees generated in PAUP. One of the 80 trees generated in PAUP is presented in Fig. 1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SLE strains from tropical and temper- ate America formed a monophyletic group (Fig. 1). The isolates were predomi- nantly, but not strictly, grouped according to geographic origin. In the parsimony analysis (Fig. 1), there are seven lineages, designated I–VII. Lineage I is com- prised of isolates from the Western U.S. and is subdivided into 2 major clusters, IA and IB. Cluster IA contains isolates from Kern County, California, made from 1953 to 1970; cluster IB consists of strains isolated from 1966 to 1998 from var- ious parts of the western U.S., including New Mexico, Colorado and California, as well as Texas. The most recent isolate from the Coachella Valley in southern California in 1998 is very closely related to the 1987 and 1989 Texas isolates from El Paso and Dallas, respectively. Other northern Texas isolates from 1966 from Dallas and 1968 from Hale County are closely related to other western U.S. isolates, i.e., one from New Mexico and one from Colorado in 1972. Lineage II contains the largest number of isolates and is formed by six major clusters of strains. Group IIA predominantly contains isolates made from 1955 to 1969 from North America, including central and south Florida from a raccoon andCx. nigripalpus, respectively, the south/central U.S. (Kentucky) from a flicker, and southern Texas (Rio Grande Valley) from man. Three Texas isolates with unknown histories are also included in this cluster, as well as a single isolate from Brazil, SPAn9398, isolated in 1968 from Akodon sp. A sister cluster, IIB, Fig. 1.

Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates. The branch lengths indicate the amount of genetic divergence, with the scale bar representing approximately 10% diver- gence. The numbers on the branches are the bootstrap values. JE, WN, MVE and KUN viruses were used as outgroup strains in this analysis L. D. Kramer and L. J. Chandler: SLE virus phylogeny 2349 contains virus isolated from 1962 to 1998, including a human isolate from Florida (Tampa Bay), 3 strains from southern Texas (Houston and Corpus Christi) from Cx. pipiens, and one isolate from Cx. pipiens from Tennessee. Lineage IIC con- tains isolates from a variety of geographic locations in the U.S., i.e., the west – California, south central U.S. – Tennessee, Mississippi, the east – Maryland, and Florida, made from 1975 to 1992. A sister cluster, IID, contains strains isolated in Florida (Tampa Bay) which are closely related to isolates from Mexico and Panama several years later. The one isolate from Panama contained in lineage IID is from 1973 from a cormorant, PanAn 902604, and the one from Mexico was isolated in 1965 from a common egret [11]. A fifth group designated IIE consists of the Hubbard and Parton isolates from St. Louis, MO, from 1933 and 1937, and the sixth group, IIF, contains one isolate, GMO94, from Guatemala, from Culex nigripalpus, in 1969. Lineage III consists of a single isolate from Argentina, 79V2533, isolated in 1979 from Culex sppmosquitoes. Lineage IV contains five isolates from Panama from several mosquito genera includingHaemagogus andMansonia, made during the years 1973–1977. Lineage V consists of South American strains and one from Trinidad, and can be subdivided into VA and VB. Group VA contains isolates from Brazil and Argentina, Peru and Trinidad. Group VB contains 3 isolates from Brazil from 1960 to 1972, made from mosquito, opossum, and man. Lineage VI is a single isolate from Panama from 1983 from a sentinel chicken; and lineage VII contains two Argentinian isolates from 1966 and 1967 from rodents,Calomys musculinus andMus musculus. These strains are the most distantly related of the SLE strains analyzed, with 10% nucleotide difference. The clustering of isolates in the neighbor-joining tree (tree not shown) is nearly the same as in the parsimony tree, with the exception of the 1983 Panama isolate from the sentinel chicken which is loosely connected with the other Panamanian isolates in the neighbor-joining tree, but is in a separate lineage by itself in the parsimony tree. Phylogenetic analysis of a 277 base portion of the envelope gene of western U.S. isolates To examine more thoroughly the genetic relationships among the SLE strains from the western half of the U.S. and Texas, a second phylogenetic analysis was con- ducted. The nucleotide sequences of 18 isolates from California which had been previously determined [16] were included in an analysis with the 30 isolates from the western U.S. sequenced in this study. A 277-base pair portion of the envelope gene, corresponding to genome position 1263–1540 was analyzed. In the previous study [16], this region showed sufficient variability to discriminate between geno- types of the virus. The Fort Washington 4 strain from the eastern U.S., was used as the outgroup. The Parton isolate (Missouri, 1933) and the Mississippi 1975 isolate were also included. Parsimony and neighbor joining analyses were both done. Parsimony search generated 500 equally parsimonious trees. Neighbor joining demonstrated four major groupings of isolates from the western U.S. and Texas Fig. 2. Phylogenetic relationships among 48 strains of SLE virus isolated in the western U.S., based on neighbor-joining algorithm using the PHYLIP package. In this analysis, a 277 base portion of the E gene was used. The Fort Washington 4 strain from the eastern U.S. was used as an outgroup in this analysis. The tree is a consensus tree of 1000 bootstrap replicates. The numbers at the forks indicate the number of times the group consisting of the strains which are to the right of that fork occurred among the trees L. D. Kramer and L. J. Chandler: SLE virus phylogeny 2351 (Fig. 2). Group I consists of recent isolates from the Coachella, Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California, isolated from 1988 to 1992. Group IIA includes isolates from northern and southern California including the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, the Imperial Valley and Los Angeles, as well as isolates from Colorado, New Mexico, and northwest Texas, i.e., Dallas, Hale County and El Paso. The isolates from California were made from 1969 to 1998, and from Texas from 1966 to 1989. Group IIB contains isolates predominantly from the San Joaquin Valley from 1952 to 1986, as well as one isolate from Los Angeles, 1984, one from the Imperial Valley, 1978, and one from the Sacramento Valley, 1972. Group III was comprised of isolates from southern Texas from 1983 to 1998, i.e., Houston and Corpus Christi, and the 1933 Parton isolate from St. Louis. Group IV contains two isolates from Texas with unknown histories and the 1955 Rio Grande isolate. One San Joaquin (1989), Sacramento (1972), and Coachella (1989) Valley isolate from California do not fit in a lineage with other isolates, but are related to the 1975 Mississippi isolate. Discussion The results of the phylogenetic studies indicate that in the Americas, geographic groupings of SLE virus strains predominate, but there are exceptions. Bootstrap values for most of the major groupings in both phylogenetic analyses were strong. California and Texas isolates both fall into two separate lineages, I and II, in the analysis of the entire envelope gene. Texas isolates from the northwestern portion of the state, i.e., the high plains region, are more closely related to isolates from western U.S., including Colorado, New Mexico, and California. Isolates from the southeastern portion of Texas are more closely related to isolates from the central U.S. (Kentucky and Tennessee). In 1975, during a large outbreak, SLE virus moved throughout the U.S., as indicated by the genetic relatedness of isolates from Tennessee, Mississippi, and California. Movement of virus within the U.S. is also evident from the close relatedness of the 1998 isolate from the Coachella Valley, CA, and the 1987 and 1989 isolates from Texas. Florida isolates also varied in genotype, although all isolates were located in lineage II. One isolate from 1979 from an unknown location within Florida was very closely related to 3 isolates from Maryland from 1975–1977, including one winter isolate from Cx. pipiens (Fort Washington 4); and two isolates from the Gulf coast of Florida, from Tampa Bay in 1962, were very closely related to a Mexican isolate from 1965, and less closely related to a 1973 isolate from Panama from a cormorant. These results indicate that some movement of SLE virus occurs around the U.S. The similarity of the Florida isolate to the Maryland isolates indicates that virus may have been introduced into Florida from Maryland or other parts of the South, or vice versa, at one time. These results are particularly significant in view of the introduction of WNV into the U.S., and its establishment in the northeast. The movement of SLE virus portends the potential of WNV to spread to other areas in the U.S. 2352 SLE virus phylogeny One of the hypotheses for endemic persistence of SLE in the U.S. is that virus is reintroduced annually from areas in Central or South America. The results of this phylogenetic analysis indicate that reintroduction does not occur often, or if it does, that virus is reintroduced from exactly the same site each year. Viral movement also may proceed from north to south. When the fall bird migration takes place, SLE is at its peak activity in Florida. Indeed, the Tampa Bay isolates were made prior to the Mexican and Panamanian isolates indicating virus may have been carried south by migratory birds during the fall migration. The predominant geographic separation of SLE strains and genetic homo- geneity over time support the hypothesis of local transmission and maintenance of the virus. Mechanisms of viral overwintering have been explored in detail by Reeves [29], the most likely for SLE including persistence in chronically infected birds and/or winter survival in diapausing adultCulexmosquitoes. These possible mechanisms are currently under study. In Texas, both urban and rural cycles of SLE transmission exist. In Houston, the virus circulates in an urban cycle and is transmitted by Cx. quinquefasciatus, while in western Texas, the virus is transmitted by Cx. tarsalis in a rural cycle. The results of our study indicate that the north Texas isolates are closely related to the endemic/enzootic California isolates, while the isolates from the coastal regions (Corpus Christi and Houston) are closely related. This close relationship among the California and rural Texas strains is not surprising and supports the hypothesis that when cases occur in urban areas in north Texas (for example, in Dallas) that virus has been introduced from the endemic cycle [18]. Future studies should include examining isolates obtained from Dallas over a period of time to determine if they are being reintroduced from the rural (Culex tarsalis-borne) cycle or if they are maintained in an urban form (Cx. quinquefasciatus-borne) similar to what occurs in Houston. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrating multiple lineages generally grouped by geographic location is similar to results obtained in other studies of SLE virus [35]. In those studies, oligonucleotide fingerprinting of viral RNA demonstrated six groupings of the virus from different geographic locations. The genetic differ- ences between virus strains that circulate in urban and rural cycles are not known. To understand completely the epidemiology and virulence of SLE, genetic infor- mation such as evolutionary rates, genetic basis of virulence, and identification of genetic markers, will be necessary. There generally were no clear differences be- tween isolates made from different host sources, such as man, rodents, birds and mosquitoes. One exception is the Panamanian mosquito isolates which grouped together while the cormorant isolate from the same time period was more similar to the North American isolates in lineage II. In the parsimony tree, the sen- tinel chicken isolate from Panama was in a separate lineage by itself, but in the neighbor-joining tree, it was related to the other Panamanian isolates, but less closely than the others were related to each other. One Florida isolate from man, TBH28 was very closely related to a second Florida isolate from the same year from Cx. nigripalpus, while a third human isolate from Florida, GHA 3, is in a separate cluster within the same lineage. The Brazilian isolate from Akodon sp is SLE virus phylogeny 2353 also in this lineage, but the other six Brazilian isolates from various sources are grouped together in lineage V.

Lelli1, G. Savini1, L. Teodori1, G. Filipponi1, A. Di Gennaro1, A. Leone1, L. Di Gialleonardo1, L. Venturi2 and V. Caporale1 1 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e Molise ‘G. Caporale’, Via Campo Boario, Teramo, Italy 2 Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale di Ravenna, Ravenna, Italy Impacts • The paper evidenced the circulation of USUTU virus (USUV) in Italy. • USUTU virus is a vector-borne virus not present in Italy which, like West Nile and Chikungunya viruses, uses mosquitoes and birds to complete its life cycle. • Events, such as the one just described, are indicators of possible emerging threats in Europe owing to vector-borne agents. Introduction The USUTU virus (USUV) is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the family of Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Its name has been derived from a river located in Swazi- land, the place where it was first isolated. It is included in the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) group (Heinz et al., 2000) and it is closely related to human pathogens, such as JEV, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) (Kuno et al., 1998; Bakonyi et al., 2004). As the other members of the group, its natural cycle involves birds and mosquitoes. Up to 2001, the virus was never associated with severe or fatal diseases in animals or humans and never reported outside tropical and subtro- pical Africa. In 2001, USUV was first described in wild birds in and around Vienna, Austria (Weissenböck et al., 2002) and since then, the infection has been causing deaths in the blackbird population of the Country (Mei- ster et al., 2007). Encephalitis, myocardial degeneration and necrosis in the liver and spleen were the lesions observed in infected birds (Chvala et al., 2004). Italy is adjacent to Austria, and because of its peculiar geographic location, is subjected to the incursions of new or re-emer- gent pathogens, especially those transmitted by vectors as evidenced by recent Bluetongue and West Nile outbreaks. As part of a systematic surveillance programme to moni- tor possible entrance and/or circulation of vector-borne viruses (West Nile and other flaviviruses), since 2001, sentinel-chicken flocks were placed throughout the Italian territory nearby areas considered at risk of virus introduc- tion. They have been periodically checked for the pres- ence of antibodies against flaviviruses in general and WNV in particular. In these areas, the wild bird mortality and the WNV seroprevalence in horses were also moni- tored (Filipponi et al., 2005).

As part of a system- atic surveillance programme to monitor possible entrance and/or circulation of vector-borne viruses, since 2001, sentinel-chicken flocks were placed through- out the Italian territory nearby areas considered at risk of virus introduction. They have been periodically checked for the presence of antibodies against fla- viviruses by indirect ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test for USUTU, West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. In July 2007, a sentinel chicken in a flock of 20 animals located within the Ravenna province seroconverted to USUV reaching neutralizing titres up to 1 : 5120. A second chicken serocon- verted to the same virus 2 months later. Although no virus was rescued from these animals and from wild or farm birds sampled in the area, these results still provided evidence of the circulation of USUV in north-eastern Italy. Zoonoses and Public Health ª 2008 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 55 (2008) 361–367 361 The presence of low neutralizing antibody titres to USUV were detected in wild birds and sentinel chickens in England and North Eastern Italy (Buckley et al., 2003; Rizzoli et al., 2007). The diagnostic and epidemiological value of these results is however difficult to interpret, as in these studies, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) cut-off titres were based on a 50% reduction in plaque counts (PRNT50). This paper documents the occurrence of USUV in north-eastern Italy by using the PRNT90, the test officially recommended by the World Organisation of animal health [Office International des Épizooties (OIE), 2006]. Materials and Methods Virus strains The strains used in this study were the USUV strain Vienna 2001-blackbird (939/01) and Tick-borne encepha- litis virus (TBEV) Hypr strain, which were kindly provided by Prof Zdenek Hubalek (Medical Zoology Laboratory, Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences, Valtice, Czech Republic), the West Nile strain Eg-101 kindly supplied by the Unité des arbovirus et des Fièvres hémorragiques, Institut Pasteur, Paris. Production of antisera Sera against TBEV, USUV and WNV were produced by injecting guinea pigs with the reference viruses. In brief, 1 ml of AlPO4 was added to 20 ml of a suspension of the reference virus against which the serum should be pro- duced. The new viral suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4�C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two millilitres of the suspension was then intraperitoneally inoculated into each of the two guinea pigs. The injections were repeated once a week for 3 weeks. Ten days after the last inoculum, the animals were bled and the samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. If the level of antibod- ies was not adequate, two further weekly injections were administered. When obtained an adequate titre, the guinea pigs were exanguinated and the serum collected. Animals Chickens. A sentinel flock of 20 domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) was included in this study. It was one of the sentinel flocks located in at-risk areas throughout the Ital- ian territory to monitor WNV circulation and vector- borne viruses. The flock was in the province of Ravenna (Fig. 1). The animals were bled every month from May to September. A total of 100 serum samples were collected during the entire period (Table 1). Following seroconver- sion, the chickens were euthanized, and from each animal, cloacal swabs, in addition to brain, spleen, heart and kidney were collected. Wild birds. From a swampy area located in the Ravenna province in close proximity to the sentinel flock, samples were collected from 83 birds belonging to 21 species (Table 2). Eighty-two serum samples and 28 cloacal swabs were taken and tested for serological and virological evi- dence of USUV. Two carcasses of a Rufous Nightingale and a Garden Warbler were also examined for the presence of USUV and other flaviviruses. Horses. Serum and EDTA blood samples were also col- lected from a total of 69 horses belonging to five stables located close by the sentinel flock within Ferrara and Ravenna provinces. Serological investigation. To detect the presence of USUV- and WNV-specific antibody response, serum samples were tested by ELISA, PRNT (OIE, 2006) and virus neutraliza- tion test in microtitre plates (SN). However, owing to their small quantity, for some sera, it was decided to use Fig. 1. Locations of USUTU virus seroconversion in Italy and birds migrating routes from Northern Europe to Africa.

To rule out possible cross-reactions of the tests, positive samples (titre ‡1 : 20) were also tested for TBEV antibodies by PRNT. Indirect ELISA. The ELISA used was an IgG ELISA set up according to Tsai et al. (1998). Plates were coated with WNV antigen prepared on Vero E6 cells according to the method used by the Unité des arbovirus et des Fièvres hémorragiques, Institut Pasteur, Paris (Tsai et al., 1998) and IgG antibodies were revealed by peroxidase antibody (Sigma, Munich, Germany). The positive threshold was selected by adding three standard deviations to the optical density mean of negative controls. The indirect ELISA was chosen to screen the samples in order to take advan- tage of its ability to detect antibodies against a wide range of flaviviruses. Virus neutralization test in microtitre plates (SN) and PRNT. Prior to the SN test, the USUV and WNV anti- gens were titrated in a cytopathic effect (CPE) TCID50 assay using African green monkey kidney Vero cells (ATCC CRL-1586 VERO C1008). Serial 10-fold dilutions of the antigen were made. After 6 days, the titre was determined by using the Reed and Muench formula. The serum samples were inactivated at 56�C for 30 min. Start- ing from 1 : 5, serial 2-fold dilutions were made from serum samples in microtitre plates, and 100 TCID units of antigen were added to each dilution. Thereafter, the mixtures were incubated at 37�C for 1 h and 105 vero cells were added to the wells. Plates were read after 6 days of incubation at 37�C. The antibody titre was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the test serum sample, which showed at least 90% neutralization. Posi- tive and negative control sera were included in each plate. The PRNT procedure to detect WNV antibodies was performed as described by the OIE Manual of standards (World Organisation for Animal Health (Office Interna- tional des Épizooties: OIE), 2006). This method was also adapted for detecting USUV and TBEV antibodies in this study. The PRNT titre was determined as the highest serum dilution with a 90% reduction of the number of plaques (PRNT90). Sera with a titre of at least 1 : 20 were consid- ered positive. The specificity of this assay for antibodies to the viruses tested (i.e. USUV and WNV) had been validated by using WNV-, TBEV- and USUV-positive test sera. Virological investigation. To detect Flavivirus and WNV antigen directly from avian organs, cloacal swabs (Chvala et al., 2005), serum or EDTA blood samples, nested and real-time (RT)-PCR were used, whereas the infection of C6/36 confluent monolayer followed by two passages in Vero E6 cell cultures were used for virus isolation (Bernard et al., 2001). Nested RT-PCR and RT-PCR. The nested RT-PCR described by Sànchez-Seco et al. (2005) was used for detecting Flavivirus antigen, whereas the RT-PCR described by Lanciotti et al. (2000) was the method used to evidence WNV RNA. The sensitivity of the methods were increased by using High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) in the viral RNA extraction phase and adding an internal control to the reaction in order to reduce the numbers of false-negative results. Virus isolation. Virus isolation was performed on C6/36 and Vero E6 cell monolayers by using the 24 flat- bottomed well microplate. C6/36 monolayers (90–100% confluent) were infected with 100- to 200-ll homogenate samples. Homogenate samples were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 28�C with gentle swirling every 15 min. Leibovitz medium with 2% foetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 200 lg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 U/mL nystatin was then added to the infected cells. The plates were incubated at 28�C . After 7 days, cells were scraped and centrifuged. Hundred to 200 microlitres of supernatant were then used to infect Vero cell monolayers (90–100% confluent). Samples were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37�C with gen- tle swirling every 15 min. Eagle’s minimal essential med- ium with 2% foetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 200 lg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 U/ml nystatin was then added to the infected cells. Plates were incubated at 37�C. Cells were monitored daily for 7 days for CPE. Cells showing CPE demonstrated rounding up in the early stage of infection and many floating single cells later in the infection. Infected cells that showed CPE were evalu- ated by RT-PCR, and a sample (100 ll) of the superna- tant was passed on another Vero cell monolayer to confirm WNV. Infected cells that showed CPE were also evaluated by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using the ascitic fluid from WNV and anti-IgG fluorescein-5-iso- thiocyanate conjugated and by electron microscopy. Cells from monolayers that did not show CPE were passaged onto fresh Vero cell monolayers and monitored for another 7 days. Cells that did not show CPE after 14 days were also tested as previously described. Only cell cultures that did not stain with IFA, negative to RT-PCR or elec- tron microscopy, were reported negative.

Lelli et al. ª 2008 The Authors 364 Journal compilation ª 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 55 (2008) 361–367 Two animals seroconverted for USUV, one in July and the other in September. The neutralizing titres were up to 1 : 5120 in the first animal and 1 : 20 in the second. In the first animal, antibody titres to WNV were also found. RT- PCR and virus isolation performed on organs, swabs and EDTA blood failed to detect or isolate infectious viruses. Other species All samples collected from different species of wild birds showed evidence neither of USUV nor of other flaviviruses. Of the 69 horses tested, nine were positive to ELISA, four of them had neutralizing titres for USUV. The titres ranged from 1 : 20 to 1 : 40. No TBEV- or WNV-neutralizing antibodies were observed in the horse-positive sera. Discussion Since 2001, USUV has found a new habitat in central Eur- ope completing its life cycle in local species of birds and mosquitoes successfully (Weissenböck et al., 2002; Stein- metz et al., 2007). Unexpectedly, following the first report, only on two occasions, the virus spread beyond the Aus- trian borders causing mortality in wild and captive Passer- iformes and Strigiformes around Zurich Zoo, Switzerland (Steinmetz et al., 2007) and in black birds in Hungary (Bakonyi et al., 2007). Apart from these episodes, the virus was not reported elsewhere in Europe (Weissenböck et al., 2003). The modest spread was attributed to the bird spe- cies involved in the transmission cycle, which are quite sedentary with little tendency to fly great distances during the season of virus activity (Weissenböck et al., 2003). Presence of low neutralizing antibody titres to USUV was detected in wild birds and sentinel chickens in England and North Eastern Italy (Buckley et al., 2003; Rizzoli et al., 2007). In these studies, the PRNT cut-off titres were based on a 50% reduction in plaque counts (PRNT50), whereas for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, the more stringent PRNT90 titres were strongly recommended in order to avoid aspecific reactions and the frequent back- ground serum cross-reactivities occurring among flavivi- ruses (WHO, 2007). The present study documents the circulation of USUV in north-eastern Italy. The evidence was based on the seroconversion observed in sentinel chickens by indirect ELISA, PRNT90 and SN. The PRNTs are the methods recommended by the OIE manual of diagnostic test for terrestrial animals (World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Épizooties: OIE), 2006). All the methods used in this study evidenced several WNV reactors owing to cross-reactivity with USUV. This phenomenon, which has already been described (Bakonyi et al., 2005; Meister et al., 2007), was minimal and only occurred in sera with high USUV titres. These sera showed, in fact, a low neutralizing activity also against WNV, but the titres were at least four logs less than those of USUV. While earlier European outbreaks involved deaths of captive and wild birds (Weissenböck et al., 2002; Bakonyi et al., 2007; Steinmetz et al., 2007), no fatalities were reported related to the episode described in this study. Evidence of the virus occurrence was shown only in sentinel chickens. Despite seroconversion, chickens remained healthy, and no pathological findings were observed. Low pathogenicity associated with USUV and related viruses, such as WNV, MVEV and SLE has already been reported in chickens. It was also shown that these animals, when infected with WNV, MVEV and SLEV, developed reliable and robust seroconversions (Maguire and Miles, 1965; Campbell and Hore, 1975; Calisher et al., 1986; Reisen et al., 1994; Komar et al., 2001), which make chickens eligible for vector competence studies and virus activity monitoring programmes (Morris et al., 1994; Ko- mar, 2001; Broom et al., 2002a, 2002b; Blackmore et al., 2003; Quirin et al., 2004; Reisen et al., 2004). In this epi- sode, USUV natural infection was able to elicit high and persistent neutralizing titres in a sentinel chicken, indicat- ing that this species might be an effective sentinel animal for USUV and/or flavivirus surveillance programmes. These findings are in disagreement with the observation that, following USUV experimental infection in chickens, viraemia and seroconversion were inconsistent (Chvala et al., 2005). This discrepancy could be attributed to a dif- ferent strain involved or, alternatively, to the fact that nat- ural infection could be more efficient in generating an immune response than an experimental one. Unfortu- nately, no virus was isolated either from infected chickens or from the other species examined. The period of sero- conversion (June–July) together with the absolute absence of bird fatalities might suggest that USUV could have been entered in Italy through migrating birds. The latters have been implicated in spreading flaviviruses in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East during migrations (Ernek et al., 1977; Rappole et al., 2000; Malkinson and Banet, 2002; Malkinson et al., 2002) and play a major role in introducing these viruses into new regions (Rappole et al., 2000; Autorino et al., 2002). In their annual migrating route from and to Africa, where most arthropod-borne viruses co-circulate and are actively transmitted between birds and mosquitoes, many birds rest in swampy areas in Italy, such as the one in the vicinity of the area, where the reported seroconversion occurred. However, to support this hypothesis, the virus should have been isolated and sequenced. Unfortunately, no virus evidence has been found in the migratory bird specimens tested up to now. These negative results are not entirely surprising consider- ing the brief period in which viraemia persists in infected birds (Komar et al., 2003). R. Lelli et al. USUTU Virus Occurrence in North-Eastern Italy ª 2008 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 55 (2008) 361–367 365 Two months after the first chicken seroconversion, a second sentinel animal showed neutralizing antibodies to USUV. In consideration of the low titre, they could have been a consequence of a cross-reaction owing to infection of other flaviviruses; however, the fact that the serum was negative to TBEV and WNV antibodies and that the chicken was in the same flock in which an USUTU seroconversion occurred, could support the USUTU sero- conversion hypothesis. It could be the result of virus transmission among non-migratory local birds via indi- genous mosquitoes. Transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, in fact, occurs mainly from viraemic birds to mosquitoes which after completion of the extrinsic incu- bation period are capable of transmitting the virus to a new avian host. Similarly, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in horses kept in proximity of the positive chicken flock could also be a consequence of the indige- nous mosquito infection or, alternatively, a consequence of other flavivirus infection. The pathogenicity of USUV for mammals and for man is still unclear. Contrary to some WNV strains which are able to cause diseases in birds, humans, several mammal species and reptiles (McLean et al., 2002), USUV has been shown to be path- ogenic only for birds with the exception of a human case characterized by fever and skin rash (Adam and Digoutte, 2007). In Austrian endemic areas, no cases were reported in either domestic animals or humans (Weissenböck et al., 2003). Furthermore, in this study, no evidence of disease was observed in seropositive horses. The presented results demonstrate the circulation of USUV in north-eastern Italy in local birds and mosqui- toes. Whether this could be an evidence of the establish- ment of an endemic infection cycle cannot be ascertained yet. Should this be the case however avian mortality in the forthcoming years can be expected in the wild bird populations, in particular blackbirds. It is worthwhile to note that the area where the USUV chicken seroconver- sions occurred is nearby that where episodes of Chikun- gunya happened (Angelini et al., 2007). The Chikungunya virus was transmitted by Aedes albopictus, which, although is not one of the most important, but is still a potential vector of USUV. It could be concluded that events, such as the one just described are indicators of possible emerging threats in Europe owing to vector-borne agents for which the impact on animal and human health is at present difficult to assess.

To assess the risk of acquiring a West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Germany, we investigated samples from migrating and from resident birds. Because of their stay in or migration through WNV-endemic regions, these birds are at risk to become infected with WNV. Blood samples from 3,399 birds, representing 87 bird species, were collected in Germany in 2000 and in 2002–2005. Overall, 53 birds belonging to 5 species had WNV-neutralizing antibodies. Fifty-nine birds belonging to 9 species were reactive by WNV immunofluorescence assay, and 8 birds had neutralizing antibodies against Usutu virus. Because of maternal antibody transfer via egg yolk, WNV-antibody titers in white stork nestlings were generally lower than those in adults. Despite a relatively high percentage of stork nestlings with anti- bodies, no viral genomes were detectable by polymerase chain reaction. In Germany, the prevalence of antibodies to WNV in migrating birds wintering in Africa or southern Europe is comparatively low. INTRODUCTION Within the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are grouped to the Japanese encephalitis antigen group. West Nile virus is endemic in different parts of the world, whereas USUV seems to be endemic only in Africa and possibly in Austria.1,2 After its introduction into New York City in 1999, WNV gained worldwide interest. In the immunologically naive host popu- lation, it has spread rapidly across North America and has had an enormous impact not only on avian and equine species but also on humans, especially in the United States. West Nile virus is transmitted naturally by ornithophilic mosquitoes (particularly species of the genus Culex) within the bird popu- lation, but some mosquitoes are also capable of transmitting the virus to mammals such as horses or humans.3,4 The virus has been found in more than 150 species of wild and domestic birds in the United States.5 Millions of birds migrate every year between Europe and Africa, wintering in or passing through WNV-endemic areas. Bird migration seems to play a major role in the dissemina- tion of WNV and USUV.6,7 In Europe, antibodies to WNV have been detected in several bird species.8,9 In the United Kingdom, investigations on the prevalence and incidence of WNV infections were carried out in 2001–2002 and showed that migrating and resident birds had antibodies to WNV or viral genomes.10 In France, virus isolation was successful in various samples from mammals such as horses.3 There are no data on endogenous WNV and USUV infections in Germany, whereas USUV infections have been diagnosed in neighbor- ing Austria.2 The aim of the present study was to investigate migrating and resident birds as a potential reservoir of WNV and USUV by using serologic and molecular methods, and to assess the possibility that migrating species import these vi- ruses from their wintering areas in Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bird capture and sampling. In 2000 and in 2002–2005 3,399 samples, representing 87 species of migrating and resident birds (Table 1), were collected in the context of bird-ringing activities or other research interests. The birds were captured by traps and mist nets, bled, and released or downed in pest- control programs. Sampling of white stork nestlings and rap- tor nestlings was performed by bleeding nestlings at nest sites. Morphologic examinations were performed to determine sex, age, and species. Rings engraved with a serial number from German ringing centers were used for individual marking. Several samples were collected from injured wild birds during veterinary care. National laws and regulations regarding pro- tection, conservation, and animal welfare were respected. Study sites. The study sites were spread all over Germany and located in rural or agricultural areas (Figure 1). Sampling. Blood was obtained by puncturing the vena ul- naris. The volume of blood was variable depending on the bird species (between 10 �L and 1 mL). Blood was collected in microtubes for serum separation (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany), in monovettes containing EDTA (Sarstedt), or in reaction tubes with anticoagulant preservative buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Body fluids from dead birds were collected from the carcasses. Sera and plasma were stored at -70°C until use. Diagnostic assays. Two methods were used for serologic diagnosis: an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a neutralization test (NT). The first screening was done using a WNV IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were diluted 1: 10 with sampling buffer and 25 �L of the diluted samples were applied to a biochip slide and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After the slide was washed for 10 min- utes, a non-labeled rabbit anti-dove IgG hyperimmune serum diluted 1:300 was added to the biochips and incubated for 30 minutes. The rabbit anti-dove IgG reacted with a broad spec- trum of antibodies derived from different bird species (Grund C, unpublished data).

After a second incubation for 30 minutes and a washing step, the slide was embedded with a drop of glycerol/PBS according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed un- der a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop MC80, filters 495 nm and 528 nm; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Reactive samples were titrated in dilution steps of 1:10, 1:100, and 1: 1000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reference goose serum with a known titer of antibodies to WNV was used as a control sample. The method of choice for flavivirus diagnostics and differ- entiation is the virus NT. A WNV-specific NT was performed in a 96-well plate format (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Vero cells were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) (PAA Laboratories, Coelbe, Germany) supple- mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories) in 96-well microtiter plates. Samples were diluted 1:10 in PBS. The stock solution of WNV strain Israel was diluted in Ea- gle’s MEM with 1% ciprofloxacin (PAA Laboratories) to a constant concentration of 500 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/mL. A total of 25 �L of virus suspension were mixed with 25 �L of serum or plasma dilution and in- cubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After incubation, the inoculum of serum and virus was added to the cells and incubated for 3 days at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The suspension of plasma and virus was then removed from the cells and 100 �L of fresh medium were added to each well and incubated for 3 days at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with naphthalene black and analyzed under a light microscope. Neutralizing goose sera were included in all experiments. Each test sample was inves- tigated in duplicate with a single well of serum-cell control without virus. Samples with neutralizing antibodies at a dilu- tion of 1:10 were titrated (two-fold serial dilutions from 1:10 to 1:2,560) to determine end point titers for WNV. Antibody titers were determined as the highest dilution of serum or plasma at which 50% of the wells did not show a cytopathic effect. Samples with a WNV antibody titer � 10 were con- sidered positive because serum dilutions < 1:10 were often toxic for cells. Some samples were further investigated in a USUV- specific plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The test FIGURE 1. Map of Germany showing different sampling sites.

LINKE AND OTHERS360 procedure was performed according to published studies13,14 with slight modifications. The test was performed in 48-well microtiter plates (Nunc) with Vero cells cultivated in Eagle’s MEM (PAA Laboratories) with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories) and 1% ciprofloxacin (PAA Laborato- ries). The serum or plasma samples were diluted two-fold from 1:10 to 1:640 in PBS. Aliquots (50 �L) of USUV strain Vienna 2001 from Austria containing 150 TCID50/mL were added to 50 �L of the sample and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus-sample suspension was applied to the cells and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After incubation, the mix- ture of plasma and virus was removed from the cell layer and fresh medium was added. An overlay of carboxymethyl cel- lulose medium (BDH Ltd., Poole, United Kingdom) was added to the cells and the cells were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 3 days. The plates were fixed and stained with naphthalene black. Plaques were counted and the 50% PRNT (PRNT50) titer was calculated according to Reed and Münch.15 Viral RNA was isolated from 552 samples from white storks; 100 �L of plasma was centrifuged for 1.5 hours at 14,000 rpm. The pellet was used for virus extraction and the supernatant was used for serologic testing. RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted in 60 �L of RNase-free water (Fluka Chemikalien GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) supplemented with RNA (100 ng/�L) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). RNA was stored at −70°C before further use. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 11.6 �L of extracted RNA in a 20-�L reaction volume. For transcrip- tion, 1 �L of the specific reverse primer (10 �M; Table 2) and 1 �L of reverse transcriptase (200 U/�L) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were used. The cDNA was stored at −20°C before further use. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) was performed on a gene sequence of the capsid pro- tein and 5�-untranslated region using the TaqMan method (Table 2). As an internal control standard of the RNA ex- traction, of cDNA synthesis, and PCR, plasma was spiked with a constant volume of heat-inactivated supernatant of Squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV), family Retroviridae. A specific RT-PCR using the SMRV envelope protein sequence was established (Table 2). RESULTS Serum or plasma samples (n � 3,399) were collected in 2000–2005. They were derived from 87 different species; spe- cifically in 2000, 41 samples from passerine birds were col- lected; in 2002, 1,175 samples from passerine birds and wa- terfowl; in 2003, 438 blood samples from White Storks; in 2004, 1,504 samples from white stork nestlings, passerine birds, and raptors; and in 2005, 241 samples from white storks and raptors, including 106 samples from nestlings and 32 from adult ospreys. Antibodies against WNV were detected using IFA in nine species (Table 3). Washed samples were analyzed by a WNV NT, neutralizing antibodies to WNV were detected in five species (Table 3). Fifty-nine blood samples from birds had antibodies to WNV by IFA, 27 of which were also positive in the NT. Using the NT, 24 additional sera were identified that were not reactive by IFA. Because of the small amount of blood from passerine birds, the WNV NT could only be carried out on 191 samples. How- ever, because of the high cytotoxic effect of these samples, only 45 samples gave a reliable result. Of all passeriformes investigated, nine samples were positive by IFA and seven of these samples had neutralizing antibodies (Table 3). On the basis of the IFA results, the percentage of samples with an- tibodies to WNV was low. Thirty-three (5.8%) of 569 Ciconia ciconia samples were reactive by WNV IFA, and only 13 (2.3%) samples were positive by WNV NT. Three sera from Cygnus olor showed neutralizing activity, but these sera TABLE 2 Oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probe for reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of WNV and SMRV* Sequence (5� → 3�) of primer and TaqMan probe Orientation‡ Genome position WNV: AY532665, SMRV: M23385 ProC-F1 CCTgTgTgAgCTgACAAACTTAgT S 10–33 ProC-R gCgTTTTAgCATATTgACAgCC AS 132–153 ProC-TM† 6FAM-CCTggTTTCTTAgACATCgAgATCTXCgTgCp AS 89–113 SMRV-7489 F CCT gCT AgT Agg ATT ggg TgT CTC T S 7489–7513 SMRV-7658 R CTA CTT Cgg CTA ggg AAT CTA gTT g AS 7634–7658 SMRV-env-probe 6FAM-TAA CgA CgT CCA AgC CTT gTC Tag CAC CAXT-p S 7588–7617 * WNV � West Nile virus; SMRV � squirrel monkey retrovirus. † X � carboxytetramethylrhodamine; FAM � 6�-carboxyfluorescein; p � phosphate. ‡ S � sense; AS � antisense.

ANTIBODIES TO WNV IN BIRDS IN GERMANY 361 showed negative results in the WNV IFA. Sixteen (11.4%) of 140 sera of Pandion haliaetus were reactive in the WNV IFA. In neutralization assays, the number of positive sera was higher (n � 28, 20%). Only one serum each of samples from Haliaeetus albicilla (n � 36), Milvus migrans (n � 1), and Accipiter gentilis (n � 19) had neutralizing antibodies to WNV. To gain insight into the potential cross reactivity of bird- infecting flaviviruses, 25 samples reactive against WNV in the IFA but negative in the NT were investigated in the USUV NT. Three samples were positive and had PRNT50 titers of 17, 21, and 37, respectively. The antibody titers against WNV varied in different serologic test systems and among the indi- viduals of the species. Tables 4 and 5 show that antibody titers determined using IFA and NT were generally lower in nest- lings than in adults (titers of adult white storks were 3-fold to 100-fold higher than in nestlings). In ospreys, only one nest- ling bird of 106 samples tested was reactive in WNV IFA but not in WNV NT; all other reactive samples were from adult birds. To clarify whether nestling and adult white storks were infected with WNV, 551 samples were investigated with a WNV-specific RT-PCR. No amplification of viral genomes was observed in the sera or plasma. As an internal control, SMRV was added to each sample as an RNA extraction and PCR control. No inhibition in the process of extraction, cDNA synthesis, and PCR was observed. Regarding the importation of WNV from Africa to Ger- many, bird species with WNV-specific antibodies were corre- lated with their migration status. Five species, most of which were migratory birds, had antibodies against WNV. While C. ciconia, M. migrans, and P. haliaetus migrate to tropical Africa, birds of the species Cygnus olor show a more complex migration behavior. Accipiter gentilis is a resident bird spe- cies, whereas birds of the species Cygnus olor are partial mi- grants. DISCUSSION In Germany, only limited information on the prevalence and incidence of WNV infections is available. In a study from Israel, white storks from Germany had WNV-neutralizing an- tibodies and juveniles on the migration route to Africa pass- ing Israel were diagnosed with WNV.6 The questions arose where white storks acquire the infection and whether there is evidence that WNV is present in Germany. We investigated the presence of antibodies to WNV in migrating and resident birds in different parts of Germany. A variety of migratory birds that breed in central Europe use African-Eurasian mi- gration routes, which are discussed as routes for importing WNV or other flaviviruses such as USUV into Europe.6,16 Birds seropositive for WNV were identified across Germany, demonstrating that there is no hotspot of birds with WNV (Figure 1). We identified 5 of 87 species with neutralizing antibodies, 3 of which can be correlated with wetland habi- tats. In most of the bird species, the percentage with neutral- izing antibodies was low, with the exception of ospreys. We detected specific antibodies in adults and in nestlings. The antibody titer of the nestlings most likely reflects the maternal antibody status because it is well known that mater- nal antibodies to WNV are transmitted from the mother dur- ing egg production.17,18 We investigated nestlings of ospreys and white storks at 2–9 weeks of age, but only one osprey had TABLE 4 Antibody titers of bird sera by West Nile virus IFA* Species IFA titer Total10 32 50 80 100 320 500 1,000 Haliaeetus albicilla – – – – – – 1 – 1 Pandion haliaetus Adults – 3 – – 10 1 – 1 15 Nestlings – – – – 1 – – – 1 Total – 3 – – 11 1 – 1 16 Ciconia ciconia Adults – – – – – 1 – 1 2 Nestlings 12 17 – – 2 – – – 31 Total 12 17 – – 2 1 – 1 33 Sylvia borin – – – – 1 – – – 1 Motacilla flava 1 – – – – – – – 1 Lanius collurio – – 1 – – – – 1 2 Ficedula hypoleuca – – 2 – – – – – 2 Erithacus rubecula – – – – 1 – – – 1 Phoenicurus phoenicurus 1 1 – – – – – – 2 * Values are number of reactive birds.

LINKE AND OTHERS362 antibodies to WNV by the IFA. In contrast, we detected neu- tralizing antibodies in adult birds living in the same region. However, we found a higher percentage of WNV-specific an- tibodies in nestlings of white storks. These results either re- flect differences in the transmission of WNV-specific antibod- ies via egg yolk or differences in the half-life of maternal antibodies in the offspring. There is limited information on the persistence of maternal antibodies against WNV in birds, which complicates interpretation of serologic results.18 Viral genomes were not detected in nestling nor adult white storks by PCR, which implies that the antibody response observed in the birds seems to be an indirect marker of the serologic status of the parent birds. The serologic data obtained by IFA and NT were not con- gruent in all cases. It is well known that there is high cross- reactivity of closely related flaviviruses in antigen detection systems such as the IFA and an enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay.19 The method of choice for detecting antibodies against flaviviruses is the NT, but cross-reacting antibodies have also been observed in this assay. High titers of neutral- izing antibodies may represent cross-reacting antibodies from flaviviruses, especially of the Japanese encephalitis serocom- plex. Differences in antibody titers against different flavivirus isolates can give further information on the virus responsible for the reduction of the immune response. The NT procedure used is very stringent and used a 100% knockout of virus infectivity for antibody detection. Under these highly de- manding conditions, it could be assumed that antibodies to WNV were acquired through exposure to WNV. Three samples of C. ciconia, Phoenicurus phoenicurus, and P. haliaetus showed positive results in the WNV IFA and had low-level neutralizing antibody titers to USUV. Findings on the emergence of USUV in Austria, which was probably in- troduced by migrating birds, showed that in the summer of 2001 several bird species were infected with USUV, and the epidemic, especially in blackbirds, was stable for more than one summer in a central European region.2 Little is known about WNV infections in wild birds in cen- tral Europe. There are limited data on the WNV seropreva- lence in passerine birds in Poland, indicating that it is at a low level.8 A study of WNV infections in Austria did not detect WNV in dead wild birds, and the investigators concluded that WNV has no measurable impact in Austria.20 However, in the United Kingdom serologic evidence for WNV and USUV was reported in wild resident and migrating birds, as well as in sentinel chickens.21 Detection of the WNV genome was dem- onstrated in crows.10 In our study, none of 41 Corvidae samples showed evidence of an antibody response to WNV. Infections with WNV in migratory birds in Europe can oc- cur either through exposure in Europe, on migratory routes, or at wintering sites in Africa. The sporadic outbreaks of WNV infections in areas in southern Europe such as Roma- nia, Tuscany in Italy, and Camargue in France do not support the assumption that WNV is endemic in these regions but may indicate that WNV is occasionally imported to these ar- eas. In tracking the migratory route of birds from Europe to Africa, it is noteworthy that there are two major destinations, one to western regions of Africa and the other to eastern parts of Africa. On the route via southeastern Europe it was observed that WNV epidemics occur in countries such as Ro- mania and Israel.22–24 Many bird species rest in Israel before or after the flight across the desert during autumn and spring migration.6 Sporadic introduction of WNV by migrating birds to central Europe may therefore be possible. However, there are limited data on the viremic phase in WNV-infected birds. In experimental infections of different bird species, viremia in birds was high for approximately four days to enable infection of mosquitoes.25 It is doubtful whether this period is long enough for direct import of the virus from disease-endemic areas in Africa to central Europe. However, infections with USUV in Austria support the as- sumption that flavivirus infections might be imported and maintained in temperate regions.2 It remains unclear why there is a low level percentage of antibodies to WNV in European migrating birds without clear evidence of WNV-diseased birds. In contrast to birds in the United States showing clinical symptoms, European birds have long been exposed to WNV on their migration routes to and from Africa. Over centuries, this exposure might have induced a natural resistance to WNV infections in European birds, whereas in America WNV was introduced into a highly susceptible bird population that had never been exposed to this virus. There is evidence of only a few human WNV infections imported from the United States into Germany. Because of climate warming, it must be assumed that further WNV in- fections limited in time and region might appear, similar to the current situation in southeastern Europe.

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs. 1. Introduction Emerging infectious diseases threaten global biodiversity and public health [1–3]. Most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of humans are zoonoses. Most zoonoses originate in wildlife and are increasing over time [3–5]; however, the relative importance of different groups of wildlife hosts in the emergence of zoonoses remains unclear, as do the mechanisms driving such differences. http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2753&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2013-02-06 mailto:angela.d.luis@gmail.com http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2753 http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2753 http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org ProcR SocB 280:20122753 2 Bats (Order Chiroptera) provide considerable ecosystem services, such as arthropod suppression, seed dispersal and pollination, across a vast range of regions and habitats. How- ever, bats are receiving increasing attention as potential reservoirs for zoonotic diseases following recent identification of their involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome- like coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, as well as Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses [6]. Consequently, there has been repeated speculation that bats may be unique in their potential to harbour zoonotic viruses [6–8]. Traits that may make bats suited to hosting more viruses in general (zoo- notic and non-zoonotic) include relatively long lifespans for their body size [9], which may facilitate viral persistence for chronic infections; the reliance of some on prolonged torpor, which can decrease both viral replication and immune function [10,11]; and flight, allowing movement and dispersal over long distances in some species. Additionally, many bat species are gregarious, some living in dense aggregations: for example, some Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) colonies can reach densities of 3000 bats per square metre, in populations of up to a million individuals per roost [12,13]. Roosting sites can house diverse assemblages of multiple bat species [14,15]. High intra- and interspecific contact rates can facilitate rapid transmission of pathogens and large population sizes could sustain acute-immunizing infections. Additionally, there are some traits that may make bats more likely to host zoonotic viruses in particular and/or transmit them to humans. In evolutionary terms, bats are ancient mammals and it has been hypothesized that viruses which evolved in bats may use highly conserved cellular receptors, thus enhan- cing their ability to transmit viruses to other mammals [6]. Many species of bats have peridomestic habits, roosting in houses and other buildings, as well as trees in dense urban areas, leading to frequent human contact with bat excreta [16–18]. Bat–human contact is also increasing in recent dec- ades owing to habitat encroachment and increased use of bats as bushmeat [17–21]. However, despite the speculation that bats are unusual in their potential to host zoonotic viruses, there are no quantitative comparative analyses to support this hypothesis. Identifying reservoir species is key to controlling emerg- ing infectious diseases, but there is currently no framework for characterizing the likely role a potential host species may play. Therefore, a general approach is needed for under- standing how host–pathogen communities are broadly structured. A growing area of research in ecology relies on trait-based approaches to predict community assembly [22]. These approaches concentrate on traits of species in an attempt to find generalities in species interactions with each other and with the environment. Characterizing which traits are associated with pathogens and their reservoir hosts will contribute to understanding basic disease emer- gence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help to focus future research and disease mitigation efforts. In this study, we make a first attempt to quantitatively address the hypothesis that bats are unique hosts of zoonotic viruses, and further, apply a trait-based approach to identify life-history, physiological and ecological traits that correlate with a species’ propensity to host zoonotic viruses. Rodents (Order Rodentia) are a suitable comparison group as they are important reservoir hosts of a number of zoonotic viral pathogens with significant impacts on public health [23]. These pathogens include hantaviruses (causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome; [24]) and arenaviruses (causing, e.g. lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Lassa fever and Argentine, Bolivian, Vene- zuelan and Brazilian haemorrhagic fevers [25]). Rodents also share a number of characteristics with bats that have been hypothesized to affect reservoir potential; both taxonomic orders are evolutionarily ancient, diverse and include many species with peridomestic habits and species that com- monly express torpor. Rodents are more diverse than bats in numbers of species and life-history strategies (the repro- duction-longevity trade-off ), which enables a more general examination of host correlates for viral richness across taxo- nomic orders. We also investigate a series of factors that may be important in pathogen sharing, such as host related- ness, geographical overlap and conservation status (which may be important in pathogen sharing, e.g. as in primates [26,27]). Finally, we examine the possibility of increased zoo- notic viruses at low latitudes, as Jones et al. proposed a link between latitude and risk of zoonotic emergence [3]. In addition to host traits, viral traits affect spillover and emergence of zoonoses: RNA viruses are more likely to emerge than DNA viruses [28], and replication in the cyto- plasm was the best predictor of cross-species transmission from livestock to humans [29]. Therefore, we also explore some basic characteristics of viruses found in bats and rodents. 2. Material and methods (a) Viral data We compiled databases of viruses in bats or rodents and the species in which each has been detected by searching Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science (http://apps.webofknow ledge.com/) for each rodent and bat genus ‘AND virus’ (under ‘Topic’) through the year 2011. Viruses were grouped at the species level, based on the International Committee on the Tax- onomy of Viruses database. Host taxonomy conforms to Wilson & Reader’s Mammal Species of the World [30]. These data- bases are included in the electronic supplementary material. Viruses were classified as zoonotic or non-zoonotic; RNA or DNA; replicating in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and whether they consist of a single segment or multiple segments. Viruses and hosts that were not identified to species were not included in the analyses. More than double the number of viruses are known for Mus musculus than for any other rodent species, as a consequence of its use as a laboratory animal and the donor of many cell lines. For example, minute virus of mice was discov- ered as a contaminant in the experimental stock of a different virus when grown in a mouse cell line [31]. Therefore, this host species was removed from analyses, because preliminary analyses identified it as a high leverage point. (b) Species trait data For as many host species in our viral database as possible, we compiled data for the following traits (see the electronic sup- plementary material, table S14 and figures S4–S8): adult body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year, litter size, torpor use, migration (bats only), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conservation status, species geo- graphical distribution area, latitude of the midpoint (centroid) of the species distribution, number of other species in the same taxonomic order that are sympatric, number of citations on Web of Science. Data were obtained from an online database of mammalian traits (http://www.utheria.com) [32] on body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year and litter http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://www.utheria.com http://www.utheria.com Table 1.

Additional values were compiled from the literature (see the electronic supplementary material, table S14 for values and refer- ences) and the AnAge database (http://genomics.senescence. info/species/) [33]. Torpor expression was treated as a categori- cal variable with three categories: (i) no evidence of torpor use, (ii) some torpor use, but not true hibernation (minimum body temperature � 118C), and (iii) true hibernation (body temperature , 118C) [34]. Species sampling intensity was represented by the logged number of Web of Science citations for the binomial species name (and commonly used synonyms) in quotations. IUCN con- servation status, species distributions and longitude and latitude coordinates for the centroids of the distributions were obtained from the IUCN website (http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical- documents/spatial-data) [35]. The IUCN has seven conservation status categories: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct. The first three categories described all the bats in our analysis, and ‘least concern’ and ‘vulnerable’ described all the rodents in our analysis. Using the shape files from the IUCN website and the command ‘over’ from the R packages ‘sp’ and ‘rgeos’ [36,37], for each species in the analysis, we calculated how many other species in the same taxonomic order had species ranges that overlapped with its own, referred to here as sympatry. This included every species of bat or rodent for which IUCN had distribution shape files (1150 species of bat and 2216 of rodent). We follow Fleming & Eby [38, p. 157] in defining migration in bats as ‘a seasonal, usually two-way movement from one place or habitat to another to avoid unfavorable climatic con- ditions and/or to seek more favorable energetic conditions’. In most cases, these are regular annual movements that vary with predictable seasonal changes in temperature (for temperate zone bats) or rainfall (tropical bats). We did not consider records of one-way movements or dispersal as evidence for migration. We categorized migratory status of bats as: (i) species that can be broadly categorized as sedentary or only local (approx. less than 100 km) migrants, (ii) species that can be generalized as regional migrants (approx. 100–500 km), and (iii) species that can be categorized as long-distance migrants (greater than 500 km). This information was compiled from the literature, with species reported to be present in an area year-round considered evidence for category 1. (c) Analysis We used generalized least squares (GLS) to examine host trait correlates of zoonotic viral richness per host species, while con- trolling for phylogeny as described below. To examine whether bats host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses per host species than rodents, with and without taking into account sampling intensity, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) with negative binomial errors. Because many life-history traits are correlated, we performed principal components analyses (PCA) on the life-history traits: logged body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year and litter size. We performed three PCAs, one for bats (PCb), one for rodents (PCr) and one for the bats and rodents com- bined (PCrb). The variables were rescaled to have unit variance before analysis in R using the ‘prcomp’ function [36], and these principal components were then used in subsequent analyses. To determine if the number of zoonotic viruses or total number of viruses hosted by a species is significantly correlated to species traits, we performed GLS models for bats and rodents separately, then on the combined bat and rodent data. Because closely related species share traits, we tested for phylogenetic dependence using a GLS framework to allow for correlation structure in the error term. The ‘APE’ package [39] in R [36] was used to calculate a phylogenetic correlation matrix in which each entry was a pairwise correlation between each pair of species based on their shared branch lengths of a mammalian phylogenetic supertree [40]. The subsets of the phylogenetic tree that we used are shown in the electronic supplementary material, figures S2 and S3. The error term for the GLS was set to this cor- relation matrix multiplied by an additional parameter, Pagel’s l, that was estimated (using ‘optim’ in R) to determine the strength of phylogenetic dependence [41,42]. A l estimate of one indicates that the error structure of the model was directly proportional to the species shared branch lengths. A l estimate of zero indi- cates that the error structure of the model was not related to the species shared branch lengths (e.g. phylogeny does not explain any additional variation), and the correlation matrix is not included in the model. Models were ranked by their Akaike information criterion with a correction for finite sample sizes (AICc) values. Correlation coefficients (R) were obtained by using Pearson’s product moment correlation comparing the observed number of viruses to model predictions. Chi-squared (x2) tests were used to examine which viral traits, such as type of nucleic acid, genomic segmentation and site of replication were associated with zoonotic infection and taxonomic order. 3. Results Bats host, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents (tables 1 and 2). The response variable, zoonotic viral richness (i.e. number of zoonotic viruses per host species), was significantly greater for bats than rodents after controlling for the significant effect of sampling effort (i.e. order and number of citations were in the best model by AICc; table 1). However, as there are approximately twice as many species of rodent as species of bat, the overall number of zoonotic viruses was fewer in bats (61) than in rodents (68). Twenty-four viruses were present in both bats and rodents, of which 21 were zoonotic. Viruses (both zoono- tic and non-zoonotic) had a broader host range in bats, averaging 4.51 bat host species per virus, whereas rodent viruses averaged 2.76, which was significantly different by t-test (t ¼ 2.17, p ¼ 0.031; table 2). http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data Table 2.

This subset of bat and rodent species had 46 and 53 zoonotic viruses, respectively, which accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in both orders. (a) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection in rodents The first three principal components accounted for 93 per cent of the variance in rodent life-history strategies. PC1r separated r-selected species (larger litter size, more litters per year, shorter lifespan) from K-selected species (lower reproductive rates and greater mass and longevity; electronic supplementary material, figure S1a x-axis and table S1). PC2r separated reproductive strategies for a given number of offspring per year (litters per year versus litter size; electronic supplementary material, figure S1a y-axis and table S1). PC3r separated species with lower or higher values for all of the life-history traits (bigger, longer lived, higher reproduction; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Two models tied for the best model by AICc in GLS analyses examining correlates of zoonotic viral richness in rodents (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). Both models included the logged number of cita- tions and rodent sympatry, with one model containing IUCN conservation status. The number of citations was positively correlated with viral richness. Rodent sympatry was also positively correlated to zoonotic viral richness, i.e. rodent species whose distributions overlapped with a greater number of other rodent species had more zoonotic viruses. Rodents with an IUCN status of ‘vulnerable’ hosted fewer zoonotic viruses than those listed as ‘least concern’. Phylogeny did not explain additional variation: for every model, l , 1 � 10211. Figure 1a shows the ranking of variables by their DAICc values on removal or addition (compared with the best model). (b) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection in bats The first three principal components accounted for 88 per cent of the variance in bat life-history strategies. Negative values of PC1b indicated species with a greater litter size, and positive values indicated species with higher mass and longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup- plementary material, figure S1b x-axis and table S3). PC2b separated species with more litters per year from those with higher longevity (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S1b y-axis and table S3). PC3b separated species with larger litters and mass from those with higher longe- vity and litters per year (see the electronic supplementary material, table S3). The best model examining correlates of viral richness in bats by AICc included (in order of importance by DAICc) bat sympatry, the logged number of citations, and PC1b accounting for 78.7 per cent of the model weight (see the electronic supplementary material, table S4). The posi- tive coefficient of PC1b in the top ranked model indicated that bats with smaller litter size, larger body mass, greater longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup- plementary material, figure S1b, x-axis) are more likely to have more zoonotic viruses. Similar to our findings for rodents, sampling effort and sympatry were positively corre- lated to zoonotic viral richness. In models that did not include sympatry, phylogeny explained additional variation (l estimates ranged up to 0.29). For all the models that included sympatry, l , 0.001, indicating phylogeny did not explain additional variation once sympatry was taken into account. The importance of the different variables ranked by DAICc is shown in figure 1b. (c) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection across both bats and rodents PC1rb of the combined data largely separated bats from rodents and accounted for 51.1 per cent of the variance in life-history traits (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S9 and table S5). PC2rb, PC3rb and PC4rb largely described body mass, litters per year and longevity, and litter size and longevity, respectively (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S9 and table S5). All four PCs were used in the GLS models that controlled for phylogeny to account for relatively small differences in life-history traits. The best model for the combined data included, in order of importance, citations, taxonomic order, taxon sympatry, the interaction between order and sympatry and torpor use (table 3 and figure 1c). Again, bats hosted more zoonotic viruses per species and the effect of sympatry for bats was 3.9 times higher than for rodents. Torpor use was negatively correlated to zoonotic viral rich- ness (see the electronic supplementary material, table S7), and there was some weight for a negative effect of latitude (table 3). Phylogeny did not explain any additional variation (l, 0.01). (d) Species trait correlates of total viral infections The species trait correlates of total viral infections were similar to those for zoonotic infections. (see the electronic supplementary material, tables S8–S10.) The best rodent model included citations, rodent sympatry and torpor. The best bat model and the best model for the combined data were the same as for zoonotic viruses. +torpor +PC3r +PC1r +PC2r +latitude +area none −IUCN status −rodent sympatry −log(citations) (a) (b) (c) 0 10 15 20 25 +migration +IUCN status +torpor +PC3b +area +PC2b +latitude none -PC1b −log(citations) −bat sympatry −5 0 10 +IUCN status +PC1rb +PC3rb +PC2rb +area +PC4rb +latitude none −torpor −order : taxon sympatry −taxon sympatry −order −log(citations) 0 10 20 30 + DAIC 5 5 Figure 1.

The zoonotic viruses in our database were much more likely to be RNA viruses (x2 ¼ 42.7, p , 0.001), have multiple segments (x2=12.3, p , 0.001) and replicate in the cytoplasm (x2 ¼ 41.8, p , 0.001; electronic supplementary material, table S11), compared with non-zoonotic viruses. From the host perspective, bats harbored a higher proportion of unsegmented genome viruses compared with rodents (x2 ¼ 6.89, p ¼ 0.008; electronic supplementary material, table S12), but no significant differences were detected in replication site or nucleic acid, and no significant differences were present if comparing only zoonotic viruses of bats and rodents. 4. Discussion It has been suggested that bats may be unique in hosting many emerging zoonotic viruses [6,7]. We found that bats indeed host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses per species compared with rodents. Additionally, using a trait-based approach, we identified important life-history and ecological predictors of zoonotic viral richness for both bats and rodents, and identified viral traits that were strongly associated with zoonotic infection. Sympatry within taxonomic order appeared to be the most important host trait associated with zoonotic viral rich- ness, other than sampling effort as reflected in number of citations. In previous studies, sympatry was also found to be an important predictor of sharing of rabies virus variants among bats [43] and viruses among primates [26]. We show that the effect of sympatry was 3.9 times stronger for bats than for rodents. Although there are fewer range overlaps in bats, perhaps a consequence of there being approximately half the number of bat species as rodent species, there appears to be a greater impact on the number of zoonotic viruses per host when sympatry does occur, suggesting that viruses may be transmitted more easily between sympatric bat species than between sympatric rodent species. One poss- ible contributing factor is the level of interspecific contacts among bats when compared with rodents because many bat roosts have a diverse assemblage of bat species [14,15], whereas rodent species typically do not share communal nesting sites. However, high contact rates alone are rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org ProcR SocB 280:20122753 6 insufficient for cross-species transmission because host and/or virus traits also determine the ability of a virus to infect new host species. For example, the level of physiological similarity across sympatric bat species could affect the ability of viruses adapted to any of the sympatric species to spillover into others (which may be why phylogeny was also an important factor in viral sharing of rabies virus variants [43]). The general- ity of viral infection traits are probably also important and could allow non-specific viruses to take advantage of multiple host species in close contact. Here, we examined viral richness, but further examination of which viruses are shared among which hosts and their characteristics is warranted and may shed more light on this question. The importance of PC1b for bats indicated that bat species with smaller litter size, greater body mass, longevity and more litters per year, tended to host more zoonotic viruses. Rodents have a broad range of reproductive strategies, but in bats, litter size is negatively correlated with the number of litters per year (Pearson’s product moment correlation, p ¼ 0.024). No bat species consistently has more than three offspring per year, but at lower latitudes (less than 208), there is some variation as to how these offspring are distrib- uted throughout the year. Our analyses suggest that species which spread births over the year host more zoonotic viruses. A potential physiological explanation is the trade-off between immune function and reproduction. Sex hormones can modulate immunocompetence and affect disease resistance genes and behaviour that may make individuals more sus- ceptible to infection [44]. A potential ecological explanation is the replenishment of the susceptible pool from births. Immunizing, horizontally transmitted infections with a high R0 (basic reproductive number) are vulnerable to ‘burn-out’ after an epidemic when the number of susceptible hosts drops below the level needed to sustain an epidemic. More litters per year could mean a more continual replenishment of susceptible individuals. Increased zoonotic viral richness with host longevity is at odds with the ‘pace of life’ hypothesis, which proposes that short-lived animals put less energy into adaptive immunity in favour of more general immune responses (like broad bac- terial recognition), which may make them more competent reservoir hosts [45]. The competency of Lyme disease hosts, for example, seems to follow this pattern [46], but there appears to be mixed evidence for this more generally [47]. This hypothesis also does not consider pathogen traits. Viruses that cause chronic or persistent infections would have higher fitness in a longer-lived host because of the increased infectious period. Therefore, how the pace of a host’s life affects reservoir potential may be a function of traits of the virus, host and/or the virus–host interaction. We hypothesized that torpor use would be positively cor- related to"

Serum was collected from each bat and assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using six flavivirus- es: West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and dengue viruses 1–4. Flavivirus-specific antibodies were detected in 26 bats (19%). The antibody-positive bats belonged to three species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (Glosso- phaga soricina), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and great fruit-eating bat (Arti- beus lituratus), and their flavivirus antibody prevalences were 33%, 24%, and 9%, respec- tively. The PRNT titers were usually highest for dengue virus 2 or dengue virus 4, but none of the titers exceeded 80. These data could indicate that most of the antibody-positive bats had been infected with dengue virus. However, because all titers were low, it is possible that the bats had been infected with another (perhaps unrecognized) flavivirus not included in the PRNT analysis, possibly a virus more closely related to dengue virus than to other flavivirus- es. Each serum sample was assayed for flavivirus RNA by reverse transcription PCR, but all were negative. Key words: Bats, Chiroptera, dengue vi- rus, flavivirus, Mexico, surveillance. Bats are one of the most abundant and geographically widespread groups of ver- tebrates. There are 1,116 recognized species of bats and they inhabit every continent (except Antarctica) and almost every ecosystem (Wilson and Reeder, 2005; Calisher et al., 2006). Bats are often found in areas inhabited by humans and harbor a diverse range of viruses of medical importance, including filoviruses, SARS-like and other coronaviruses, heni- paviruses, and lyssaviruses. Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) are recognized human pathogens in the genus Flavivirus, family Flavivir- idae. The role of bats in the transmission and ecology of DENV, WNV, and SLEV is not well understood, but several studies have demonstrated that bats of some species are susceptible to infection by these viruses (Sulkin et al., 1966; Paul et al., 1970; de Thoisy et al., 2009). Dengue virus exists as four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), and all are present in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (Lorono- Pino et al., 2004). Serologic data indicate that WNV and SLEV also occur in this region (Farfan-Ale et al., 2006). Never- theless, there is no information on the infection or prevalence of antibody to these viruses or any other flaviviruses in bats in the Yucatan Peninsula. Dengue virus–specific nucleic acid and antibodies were detected in bats in the nearby states of Veracruz, and DENV-specific antibod- ies were detected in bats in the states of Colima and Jalisco in southwest Mexico (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). No other investigators have examined whether fla- viviruses infect bats in Mexico. Our goal was to determine the occurrence of selected flaviviruses in bats in Merida, the largest city in the Yucatan Peninsula. We collected whole blood from 140 free-ranging bats captured using mist nets at five study sites, July–October 2010. One site was within the central business district (CBD); the other four were directly to the north, south, east, or west of the CBD.

The southern site (Parque Metropolitano; 20u53950.80N, 89u39931.10W) was established in a public park with abundant trees and other vegetation and three small caves. The eastern site (Acua- parque; 20u56950.80N, 89u34940.40W) was in a public park containing a manmade lake, recreational facilities, low scrub, and native grasses. The western site (Parque Hundido; 20u58936.80N, 89u39928.50W) was a public park with numerous trees, native grasses, and several ponds. We trapped four nights a week (one site per night) using three mist nets (632 m with 16-mm mesh openings) at each site. Nets were placed over water, along fruiting trees, and at the entrances of caves whenever possible. Nets were set from dusk (,7:00 PM) until 11:00 PM. Captured bats were placed in cloth bags until processed. Bats were identified to species, age class (juvenile or adult), and sex (Medellı́n et al., 1997). Taxonomy followed Wilson and Reeder (2005). Ap- proximately 100 mL of blood was collected from each bat by nonlethal cardiac punc- ture or from the ulnar vein. Blood samples were diluted 10-fold using phosphate- buffered saline containing 0.75% bovine albumin fraction V, 500 units/mL penicil- lin, 500 mg/mL streptomycin, and 12.5 mg/ mL amphotericin, and placed on ice. Samples were transported to the labora- tory, centrifuged, and stored at 270 C. Sera were assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) following stan- dard methods (Beaty et al., 1995). The PRNTs were done using WNV (strain NY99-35261-11), SLEV (strain TBH-28), DENV-1 (strain Hawaii), DENV-2 (strain New Guinea C), DENV-3 (strain H-87), and DENV-4 (strain H-241). The PRNTs were performed in six-well plates contain- ing confluent monolayers of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera were initially tested at a dilution of 1:20, and those that reduced the number of plaques by $70% were titrated. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilutions yielding $90% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT90). Mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluids containing antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and DENV1– 4 were used as positive controls and sera from uninfected mice served as negative controls. Sera were also assayed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for flavivirus RNA. Briefly, 100 mL of each serum sample was added to 0.9 mL of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and total RNA was extracted in accor- dance with the manufacturer’s instruc- tions. Complementary DNAs were gener- ated using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Thermo Fisher Scien- tific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The PCRs were performed using Taq poly- merase (Invitrogen) and flavivirus-specific primers that target an ,800-nucleotide region of NS5 gene (Maher-Sturgess et al., 2008). The RT-PCR products were exam- ined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. We captured 140 bats belonging to two families, five subfamilies, and seven species (Table 1). The most highly represented species were the Jamaican fruit bat (Arti- beus jamaicensis) and great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus), which comprised 56% and 23% of captures, respectively. Eighty- nine (64%) bats were adults and 51 (36%) were juveniles. Fifty-nine bats were trapped in Parque Hundido, 42 in Parque Metropolitano, 21 in Acuaparque, 14 in the Merida zoo, and four in Santa Gertrudis Copo. All bats were nonmigratory and appeared healthy. Twenty-six bats (19%) had evidence of flavivirus infection (Tables 1 and 2). The bats with antibodies belonged to three species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina), Jamaican fruit SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 685 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis bat, and great fruit-eating bat. The species with the highest flavivirus antibody prev- alence was the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (33%). Antibody prevalences for the Jamaican fruit bat and great fruit-eating bat were 24% and 9%, respectively. Fifteen (58%) of the bats with flavivirus- specific antibodies were adults; 11 (42%) were juveniles. The PRNT90 titers were usually highest for DENV-2 or DENV-4, although all of the titers could be considered low because none exceeded 80 (Table 2). Low anti- body titers were also observed in bats from Costa Rica and Ecuador; these bats were assayed by PRNT using all serotypes of DENV and none had titers (when ex- pressed as PRNT80) above 80 (Platt et al., 2000). Likewise, low antibody titers were detected in bats from China that were assayed by microseroneutralization test using Japanese encephalitis virus (Cui et al., 2008). Our PRNT data could indicate that most of the flavivirus-antibody–positive bats had been exposed to DENV but high levels of neutralizing antibodies were not generated because DENV replicates inef- ficiently in chiropterans. Another potential explanation is that efficient DENV repli- cation does occur in bats but the titers were low because bats do not produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in response to DENV infection. In this regard, neutralizing antibodies to WNV were not detected in any bats following WNV inoculation, even though some were viremic (Davis et al., 2005). Experimental infection studies should be performed to assess the viremia profiles and antibody responses in bats after DENV inoculation. Flavivirus-specific neutralizing antibodies have been shown to persist at low titers in some vertebrate species long after the initial exposure (Gibbs et al., 2005), and therefore another explanation is that some of the infections were not recent. How- ever, this is probably not a major reason because 42% of the flavivirus-antibody– positive bats were juveniles. A more likely reason is that the majority (if not all) of the antibody-positive bats were infected with another, perhaps unrecognized, flavivirus not included in the PRNTs and that the low titers are due to serologic cross- reactivity. Flaviviruses have a close anti- genic relationship and therefore neutraliz- ing antibodies to one flavivirus often cross- react with heterologous flaviviruses (Cal- isher et al., 1989). Other flaviviruses known to infect bats include Rio Bravo virus (RBV) and Tamana bat virus (Allen et al., 1970; Price, 1978). Additional flaviviruses were not included in the PRNTs because many of the bats were small and the volume of sera available was limited. As stated earlier, 19% of bats had flavivirus-neutralizing antibody. Similar flavivirus antibody prevalences have been reported for bats elsewhere in Latin TABLE 1.

SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 687 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis America. In a serosurvey performed in Guatemala, 19% of bats had antibodies that neutralized RBV (Ubico and McLean, 1995). Evidence of flavivirus infection was detected in 23% of bats in Costa Rica that were assayed by PRNT using all DENV serotypes (Platt et al., 2000). Higher antibody prevalence (30%) was observed in bats in Ecuador. However, in the studies described above, titers were ex- pressed as PRNT80, and therefore the reported antibody prevalences would have presumably been slightly lower if the more stringent PRNT90 had been used. In another study, 12% of bats in Colima, Jalisco, and Veracruz, Mexico, had anti- bodies that reacted with DENV antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). We did not detect flavivirus RNA by RT- PCR in any of the sera. Evidence of flavivirus infection has been demonstrated in bats assayed by RT-PCR in other studies (Zhang et al., 1998; Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008; de Thoisy et al., 2009). For example, DENV-2 RNA was detected in heart tissues from three species of bats in Veracruz (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). A notable difference between our study and the others cited here is that our RT-PCRs were performed using sera rather than tissues. Approval to perform terminal bleeds and harvest was not granted for our study. We have provided serologic evidence that flaviviruses infect bats of some species in the Yucatan Peninsula. Our PRNT titers were often highest for DENV, but, because all of the titers were low, many (if not all) of these bats could have been infected with a flavivirus not included in the PRNTs. Experimental infection stud- ies are needed to assess the potential of bats to serve as amplifying hosts of DENV. These experiments would also provide valuable information on the viremia pro- files and antibody responses in bats after DENV inoculation. Such data would facilitate the interpretation of PRNT data obtained in flavivirus serosurveys among free-ranging bats. We thank Virginia Ramirez-Sosa for assisting with trapping.

Mackenzie-2009-The zoonotic flaviviruses of so.pdf	"The Zoonotic Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern and Eastern Asia, and Australasia: The Potential for Emergent Viruses ORIGINAL ARTICLE The Zoonotic Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern and Eastern Asia, and Australasia: The Potential for Emergent Viruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Division of Health Sciences, Curtin University of Technology, Perth Impacts • Flaviviruses of southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia comprise at least 30 viruses, ranging from major pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), and the four dengue viruses, to other viruses which either cause minor human febrile diseases or have not been associated with human disease. • Flaviviruses have been shown to have a propensity to spread, emerge and establish in new geographic areas, and thus any member may have the potential to emerge unexpectedly anywhere if suitable vectors and vertebrate hosts occur. • Most members of the genus have little or no known association with human or animal diseases, but they may all have an inherent potential to be more pathogenic in the future – indeed, with flaviviruses, one should expect the unexpected, they are unpredictable with respect to disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, and unexpected methods of transmission. • Phylogenetic studies suggest JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses may have derived from an ancestral African flavivirus and evolved in the Indo-Malay area to subsequently disperse throughout their geographic ranges, whereas WN virus probably evolved in Africa, and different genetic lineages spread to Australasia (lineage 1b), India (lineages 1a and 5), Malaysia (a newly identified lineage 6). In addition, a separate lineage evolved in Africa to become the closely related Koutango virus (lineage 7). • Novel flaviviruses have emerged in the region, including New Mapoon virus in northern Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus from Thailand, which demonstrates that new flaviviruses might be found in different ecosystems.

These include major pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), tick-borne encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, and the dengue viruses. Other members are known to be associ- ated with mild febrile disease in humans, or with no known disease. In addi- tion, novel flaviviruses continue to be discovered, as demonstrated recently by New Mapoon virus in Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus in Thailand. About 19 of these viruses are mosquito-borne, six are tick-borne, and four have no known vector and represent isolates from rodents or bats. Zoonoses and Public Health ª 2009 The Authors 338 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 Introduction The family Flaviviridae comprises three genera; the Flavi- virus genus, the Pestivirus genus, and the Hepacivirus genus. The viruses are 40–60 nm in diameter, spherical in shape, and contain a lipid envelope. All members of the family have a genome composed of a single molecule of linear positive-sense RNA, ranging in size from about 9.6 kb for Hepaciviruses, to 11 kb for Flaviviruses, and 12.3 kb for Pestiviruses. Members of each genus are sero- logically related to each other, but not to members of the other genera (Thiel et al., 2005). The Pestiviruses infect pigs and ruminants, but are not zoonotic. The major members of the genus include Bovine diarrhoeal disease virus and Classical swine fever virus. Hepaciviruses com- prise the hepatitis C viruses and only infect humans. Thus, these two genera will not be discussed further. The Flavivirus Genus The Flavivirus genus comprises over 70 members (Thiel et al., 2005). The type species is yellow fever virus from which the genus (and family) name is derived (flavus, Latin for ‘yellow’). Members of the genus Flaviviruses are found widely dispersed throughout the world on all con- tinents except Antarctica. Most are transmitted by an arthropod vector, either mosquitoes or ticks, but a few viruses have no known vector species. The most impor- tant mosquito-borne viruses are yellow fever virus, which is found in west, central and east Africa and tropical South America; Japanese encephalitis (JE) which is found in east, south-east and southern Asia, and in northern Australasia (Mackenzie et al., 2007); West Nile (WN) virus which is found in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, southern Asia, Australasia, and most recently, in North America and now spreading into Central and South America (Kramer et al., 2007; Blitvich, 2008); and dengue viruses which are found throughout much of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In addition, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and St Louis encephalitis (SLE) are the major encephalitic viruses in their respective geo- graphic regions, Australasia and the Americas respectively. The most important tick-borne virus is Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus which is found in central Europe and across the central and northern Asian continent. Others are important regionally, such as Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus in India. There are approximately 39 mosquito-borne members of the genus, 15 tick-borne members, and 17 with no known vector. The major crite- ria for determining the groupings of species and members within the genus are nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data, antigenic relationships, vector association and geographic incidence (Calisher and Gould, 2003; Thiel et al., 2005). The mosquito-borne viruses have been grouped into seven groups: the Aroa virus group with four members, the JE virus group with 10 members, the Ntaya virus group with six members, the Kokobera virus group with two members, the Dengue virus group with five members, the Spondweni virus group with two members, and the Yellow fever virus group with 10 members (Thiel et al., 2005). Some members are defined as subspecies (e.g. Kunjin virus as a subspecies of WN virus, and Alfuy virus as a subspecies of MVE virus), however, the interpreta- tion of the criteria for assigning a species level, and the definition of what constitutes a subspecies may be contro- versial. Thus, Kunjin virus is clearly a WN virus and a member of WN lineage 1, although forming a distinct clade, lineage 1b (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002), and Alfuy virus has recently been fully sequenced and is also clearly a separate species (May et al., 2006). The tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprise 12 spe- cies divided into two groups, the mammalian and seabird groups, with two of the mammalian species comprising an additional seven subtypes (Thiel et al., 2005). In the mammalian tick-borne group, six species are capable of Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggest that JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses probably emerged in the Malaya-Indonesian region from an African progenitor virus, possibly a virus related to Usutu virus. WN virus, however, is believed to have emerged in Africa, and then dispersed through avian migration. Evidence suggests that there are at least seven genetic lineages of WN virus, of which lineage 1b spread to Australasia as Kunjin virus, lineages 1a and 5 spread to India, and lineage 6 spread to Malaysia. Indeed, flaviviruses have a propensity to spread and emerge in new geographic areas, and they represent a potential source for new disease emergence. Many of the factors associated with disease emergence are present in the region, such as changes in land use and deforesta- tion, increasing population movement, urbanization, and increasing trade. Fur- thermore, because of their ecology and dependence on climate, there is a strong likelihood that global warming may significantly increase the potential for disease emergence and/or spread. J. S.

Of these, KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever viruses cause haemorrhagic fever in humans, while the remaining spe- cies are encephalitogenic. Gadget’s Gully (GGY) virus and Royal Farm virus make up the remaining species of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. The seabird tick- borne virus group contains the species Meaban, Saumerez Reef (SRE), Tyuleniy and Kadam viruses. However, a recent expanded phylogenetic analysis of these viruses identified Kadam virus as a distinct third group within the tick-borne flaviviruses (Grard et al., 2007). Transmis- sion of tick-borne viruses to mammalian or avian hosts occurs through the bite of infected ticks; virus can be transmitted by infected larvae, nymphs or adult ticks. TBE virus infections of humans can also occur via untreated milk of goats, sheep and cows (Kohl et al., 1996). A major factor in virus transmission between ticks is transfer from infected to uninfected ticks during co-feeding (Jones et al., 1987). Virus is also maintained by transovarial and transstadial transmission (Danielová and Holubová, 1991; Nuttall and Labuda, 2003). Once a tick is infected, it carries the virus for the duration of its lifetime. There are no major human or animal pathogens amongst the flaviviruses with no known vector. These viruses have been isolated from bats or rodents (Varelas- Wesley and Calisher, 1982). Two additional viruses are listed as tentative species in the genus; Tamana bat virus and Cell fusing agent virus. The latter, a virus associated with Aedes mosquitoes, has often been used as an out-group in phylogenetic studies, but recent data on Tamana bat virus suggest that it may be more distant (de Lamballerie et al., 2002), and thus a more appropriate choice as an outgroup for phylogenetic analy- ses. In addition, a novel insect flavivirus, Culex flavivirus (CxFV), has recently been reported from Japan which was found to be widespread in Culex pipiens and other Culex mosquitoes (Hoshino et al., 2007). It was able to replicate in cultured mosquito cells but not mammalian cells. Genetic sequencing revealed that CxFV is closely related to Cell fusing agent virus and Kamiti River virus, the other two members of the genus associated with mosquitoes. Perhaps the more useful indication of relationships between flaviviruses can be obtained from phylogenetic studies which tend to agree with antigenic and vector/ host relationships (e.g. Kuno et al., 1998; Poidinger et al., 1996; de Zanotto et al., 1996; Mackenzie et al., 2002a). A phylogenetic tree of the major members of the genus is shown in Fig. 1. Flaviviruses have shown a significant propensity to emerge and establish in new geographic areas. This was first observed some 400 years ago when yellow fever virus spread from West Africa to the New World through the slave trade, but more recently has been seen with a num- ber of other members of the family. Thus WN virus jumped from the Middle East to North America in 1999 (Jia et al., 1999; Lanciotti et al., 1999); Usutu virus spread from Africa to emerge in Austria as a disease of black- birds (Weissenböck et al., 2002); and JE virus has spread from south-east Asia into Australasia, first into Papua New Guinea (Johansen et al., 2000) and then into the Torres Strait of Northern Australia (Hanna et al., 1996). Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern, and Eastern Asia and Australasia There are at least 30 flaviviruses found in Southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia which have been recognized and classified into 11 of the 12 recog- nized groups; 19 of the viruses are transmitted principally by mosquitoes, seven by ticks, and four have no known vector (Mackenzie, 2000). These viruses and their serolog- ical group are shown in Table 1, and the phylogenetic relationships of the Asian and Australasian viruses com- pared with other members of the genus are shown in Fig. 1, with the Asian and Australasian viruses depicted within boxes. In addition, a map showing the location of their initial isolation or detection is shown in Fig. 2. They include some major pathogens, such as JE, WN, MVE and the dengue viruses, whereas some of the other mem- bers have not been associated with disease in humans or animals. With the exception of the dengue viruses, all of the flaviviruses have an animal reservoir, and thus either are, or have the potential to be, zoonotic. While the den- gue viruses may also be epizootic in their sylvan habitats in south-east and southern Asia, or West Africa, with non-human primates as their vertebrate hosts leading to occasional human infections (Rudnick, 1965; De Silva et al., 1999; Wolfe et al., 2001), dengue is now primarily an urban and peri-urban disease with humans as the Fig. 1.

Because the incidence of zoonotic transmission of dengue is probably relatively infrequent in most of the region, the dengue viruses will not be further discussed in this presentation. Mosquito-borne Flaviviruses The most important mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviruses in South-East Asia and the Western pacific are members of the JE serological group (Mackenzie et al., 2002a), and especially JE, MVE, and WN (including Kunjin viruses) viruses. The importance of the other mosquito-borne flaviviruses found in Asia and Australasia as causes of human or animal disease are less well defined, although at least one, Wesselsbron virus, is a major animal and human pathogen in Africa. Details of the viruses are sum- marized in Table 1, with the year and region of isolation, the major vector species and vertebrate hosts, and associa- tion with disease shown for each virus species. JE virus JE virus is the major mosquito-borne encephalitic flavivi- rus in Asia (Table 1). It is believed to be responsible for more than 40 000 cases of encephalitis annually, with at least 10 000 deaths, although these figures are generally regarded as a significant underestimate, and the true dis- ease burden might be closer to 175 000 cases annually (Tsai, 2000). With the near eradication of poliomyelitis, JE virus is now the leading cause of childhood viral neu- rological infection and disability in Asia (Halstead and Jacobson, 2003). Its geographic range extends from Japan, Korea and Maritime Siberia in the north, through China to the Philippines in the east, and through south-eastern Table 1.

In recent years, JE has spread westwards into Pakistan in 1994 (Igarashi et al., 1994), into Kerala State in southwestern India in 1996 (Dhanda et al., 1997), and eastwards into the Australasian region in 1995 and 1998 (Hanna et al., 1996, 1999; Ritchie et al., 1997; Johansen et al., 2000; Mackenzie et al., 2002b). Until the 1995 JE virus outbreak in the Torres Strait of northern Australia, and without good scientific reasons, the south-eastern limit of JE virus was believed to be restricted to the north and west of the Wallace Line, an imaginary line running between Bali and Lombok and separating the Oriental and Australasian zoogeographic regions, whereas MVE virus was believed to be restricted to the south and east of the line (Marshall, 1988; Mackenzie et al., 2002b). Much of the spread in Asia is believed to be due to defor- estation for increased agriculture, and changes in land use with the large increase in rice fields and irrigated agricul- ture. JE is a zoonotic disease; the major vertebrate hosts for JE virus are pigs and ardeid birds, with pigs playing a central role in virus amplification. Indeed, pigs are often the drivers of epidemic activity, although epidemics can sometimes occur in their absence (Soman et al., 1977). The disease in pigs is relatively minor; transplacental transmission of JE virus is well established, leading to foe- tal encephalitis, abortion and stillbirth, and it also causes hypospermia and aspermia in boars (e.g. Takashima et al., 1988; Daniels et al., 2002). Ardeid birds are the mainte- nance hosts of JE virus, particularly Black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), Little egrets (Egretta garz- etta), and Plumed egrets (E. intermedia), but the virus does not cause disease in birds. Pigs can also act as main- tenance hosts in endemic areas. JE virus also causes encephalitis in horses, but as with humans, horses are ‘dead-end’ hosts and not involved in onward transmission (Ellis et al., 2000). Orangutans have also been implicated as possible vertebrate hosts in sylvatic cycles of JE trans- mission in Borneo (Wolfe et al., 2001). A number of mosquito species have been shown to be competent for transmitting JE, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus, Cx. vishnui, and Cx. annulirostris being the most impor- tant species in various geographic locations. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that at least four distinct genotypes of JE virus are circulating in Asia and northern Australasia (Fig. 3) (Chen et al., 1990, 1992; Ali and Igarashi, 1997), and there is limited evidence of a fifth genetic lineage isolated in Singapore (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2001). Only one of these genotypes (G3) has been found in all regions encompassing the geo- graphic range of JE virus, while G1 and G2 have been found in eastern and south-eastern Asia and northern Australasia. The circulation of the fourth genotype appears to have been restricted to Indonesia (Solomon et al., 2003). Fig. 2.

Williams The Zoonotic Flaviviruses ª 2009 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 343 MVE and Alfuy viruses MVE and Alfuy viruses are Australasian members of the JE serological complex (Mackenzie et al., 1994). MVE virus is the cause of Australian encephalitis and is the most important Australasian member of the complex. It is found in mainland Australia, New Guinea, and proba- bly in the eastern Indonesian archipelago (Mackenzie et al., 1994; Spencer et al., 2001). It is endemic in north- ern Australia, especially in the Kimberley region of Wes- tern Australia and the north of the Northern Territory, and possibly endemic in parts of northern Queensland. It is epidemic in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and very occasionally it spreads into south-eastern Aus- tralia where it causes major epidemics and from where the virus obtained its name. The two most recent epidem- ics in south-eastern Australia were in 1951 and 1974, but the virus also occurred in south-eastern Australia in 1956, and most recently, in 2008 although at the time of writ- ing, no clinical cases have been reported. Since 1978, about 90% of human cases have occurred in the north- west of Australia, particularly the Kimberley and Pilbara regions, and in the Northern Territory, possibly due to the damming of the Ord River and the establishment of large areas of irrigated agriculture (Mackenzie and Broom, 1998). Indeed, the virus has been gradually moving further south in Western Australia, and is now within about 400 km of Perth in the south-west corner of the State (Broom et al., 2002). The major mosquito vec- tor of MVE virus is Cx. annulirostris, although the virus has been isolated from a number of other mosquito species (Russell, 1995), some of which undoubtedly are involved in transmission cycles. The major vertebrate hosts are believed to be ardeid birds, of which the most important is the Nankeen night heron (N. caledonicus). Limited sequence and antigenic analyses using mono- clonal antibodies have suggested that at least four genetic lineages of MVE virus occur in Australasia (Fig. 3), two of which are found on the Australian mainland, lineages 1 and 2, and two in Papua New Guinea, lineages 3 and Fig. 3.

The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 344 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 4 (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988; Poidinger et al., 1996; Johansen et al., 2007). Alfuy virus has not been associated with human disease (Mackenzie et al., 1994), and is generally less neuroinva- sive in murine experiments (May et al., 2006). Alfuy virus is also believed to utilize ardeid birds as its major reser- voir host, and Cx. annulirostris as its major vector species. Recent antigenic, genetic and virulence studies have shown that it is closely related to MVE virus (Fig. 3), but is genetically, antigenically and phenotypically distinct (May et al., 2006). Indeed, these differences have led to the proposal that Alfuy virus be re-classified as a distinct virus within the JE virus group (May et al., 2006). WN virus WN virus is found in southern Asia, especially in India (Banerjee, 1996; Bondre et al., 2007; Mackenzie et al., 2007), and sporadically in South-East Asia, two examples being from Cambodia and Sarawak (Karabatsos, 1985; H.S. Hurlbut, unpublished data, cited by Simpson et al., 1970). Cases of WN encephalitis and febrile disease have been reported sporadically in India (Banerjee, 1996; Thak- are et al., 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2007), which is a very different pattern to the epidemic activity displayed by JE virus. In Australasia, WN is found as Kunjin virus (Scherret et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2002), a genetically distinct sub- lineage of WN virus lineage 1. Kunjin virus can also cause encephalitis, Kunjin encephalitis, but the disease is gener- ally milder than that caused by MVE virus. It can also cause a febrile illness, sometimes with polyarthralgia and polyar- thritis (Hall et al., 2002). As described for MVE, the geo- graphic range of Kunjin virus probably extends through New Guinea to parts of the eastern Indonesian archipelago, although this has only been indicated from serological data. Kunjin virus has also been reported from Sarawak, Borneo (Bowen et al., 1970), and Cambodia (J. Casals, personal communication to Bowen et al., 1970). Thus, the separate reports of WN virus and Kunjin virus in south-east Asia may be due to slight differences in the serological identifi- cation. However, sequence data have shown that a Sarawak strain of Kunjin virus is significantly different to other WN viruses (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002). WN virus exists in a number of distinct genetic lin- eages and sub-lineages (Fig. 3). The strain of WN virus that recently emerged in New York, and the virus strains responsible for most of the major disease outbreaks, are members of WN lineage 1a, whereas the original isolate of WN virus from Uganda belongs to lineage 2 (Berthet et al., 1997; Lanciotti et al., 1999; Scherret et al., 2002). Within lineage 1, two additional sub-lineages has been recognized – lineage 1b which contained all the Austral- asian Kunjin viruses, and lineage 1c which comprised four Indian WN virus isolates (Lanciotti et al., 1999; Scherret et al., 2001). However, in a more recent detailed phylogenetic study, Bondre et al. (2007) have described five genetic lineages; lineages 1a, 1b and 2 remain as described but the Indian isolates previously comprising lineage 1c have been placed in a new lineage, lineage 5. In addition, two newly described flaviviruses from the Czech Republic and the Caucasus, Rabensburg (Bakonyi et al., 2005) and LEIV-Krns88-190 (Lvov et al., 2004) respec- tively, have been placed into lineages 3 and 4. The Sara- wak Kunjin virus strain, however, is significantly different to the other Kunjin viruses, and it is suggested that this virus should be re-classified as lineage 6. Furthermore, the African virus, Koutango, is closely related to the WN virus lineages, and should perhaps be considered as a sev- enth lineage (Fig. 3). The vertebrate hosts of WN virus are birds, and in the old world, especially ardeid birds. In Australasia, Kunjin virus shares vertebrate hosts and vectors with MVE virus; thus the vertebrate hosts and vectors are ardeid birds, especially the Nankeen night heron, and vectors, such as Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes, respectively. However, there appears to be ecological differences between Kunjin and MVE, with Kunjin spreading into southern Australia more frequently than MVE virus. Tembusu, Sitiawan and ThCAr viruses Tembusu virus was first described in 1957 from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2), where it had been isolated from Cx. triteaniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus, Aedes linneatopennis, and Anopheles philippinensis (cited in Karabatsos, 1985). It was subsequently isolated in Thai- land from Cx. gelidus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, and Cx. sitiens (P.K. Russell, personal communication in Karabatsos, 1985; Leake et al., 1986) and in Sarawak from Cx. gelidus, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (Simpson et al., 1970; Platt et al., 1975). The reservoir hosts of Tembusu remain unknown, but there has been serological evidence to suggest that birds and domestic chickens may act as reservoirs (Platt et al., 1975; Wallace et al., 1977). Tembusu virus has not been associated with human disease, but neutralizing antibody to the virus has been reported in human sera from Kuala Lumpur and Sabah indicating the occurrence of asymptomatic infec- tions (Wallace et al., 1977; Karabatsos, 1985; Wolfe et al., 2001) and in Lombok, Indonesia (Olson et al., 1983), and Tembusu virus was shown to cause encephalitis in experi- mentally infected monkeys (C.E.G. Smith, unpublished results cited by Simpson et al., 1970). Two other related viruses have been described, ThCAr virus (Pandey et al., 1999) and Sitiawan virus (Kono et al., 2000) (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2). Both viruses are J. S. Mackenzie and D. T.

ThCAr virus was isolated from from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes trapped in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 1992, but no disease associations have been observed (Pandey et al., 1999). Sitiawan virus was first described as a cause of encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chickens in Perak State, Malaysia, in 2000 (Kono et al., 2000), but there has been no evidence of human infections. Zika virus Zika virus is a relatively common virus throughout most of Africa, and has been associated with occasional human disease consisting of fever with headache and rash (Kar- abatsos, 1985). In Asia, serological evidence of Zika virus infections had been reported from India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines, but the viru"

Blood samples were taken from 16 Hoffman’s two-toed sloths (HTSs; Choloepus hoffmanni) and 26 brown-throated sloths (BTSs; Bradypus variegatus) over a 3-yr period. We used serologic assays to detect antibodies against 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths (St. Louis encephalitis [SLEV], Changuinola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Ilheus [ILHV], Oropouche, Mayaro, Utinga, Murutucu, Punta Toro, and vesicular stomatitis [VSV] viruses) and six arboviruses not described in sloths (Rio Grande, West Nile [WNV], eastern equine encephalitis, Piry, Munguba, and La Crosse viruses). Overall, 80% of sloths had detectable antibodies to SLEV, 67% had antibodies to ILHV, 32% to Punta Toro virus, 30% to Changuinola virus, 15% to WNV, 14% to VSV, 11% to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and 10% to Rio Grande virus. No samples had detectable antibodies to the remaining eight viruses. We found a significant increase in prevalence of antibody to VSV in HTSs between 2005 and 2007, and for WNV antibody between 2005 and 2006. We found no significant differences in the prevalences of antibodies to the sampled viruses between the two locations. Antibody prevalences were significantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs for SLEV in 2005. Antibody-positive results for ILHV were likely due to cross-reaction with SLEV. The novel finding of antibodies to Rio Grande virus in sloths could be due to cross-reaction with another phlebovirus. These findings might have implications for land management and domestic animal health. Due to the nature of the study, we could not determine whether sloths could represent amplification hosts for these viruses, or whether they were only exposed and could be used as sentinel species. Further studies are needed to fully characterize arboviral exposure in sloths.

Additionally, sloths are hosts to some viruses often shared between livestock and other domesticated species (Seymour et al. 1983c; Figueiredo 2007). The low metabolism of sloths could be associated with a long-lasting viremia for many viruses, which might increase transmis- sion stability (Seymour et al. 1983a). We screened for antibody to selected arboviruses in populations of BTSs and HTSs inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica. The viruses included 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths: St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), Changuinola (CGLV), Ilheus (ILHV), Oropouche (OROV), Mayaro (MAYV), Utinga (UTIV), Murutucu (MURV), Punta Toro (PTV), and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) viruses (Tesh et al. 1969; Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c; Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al. 2001) and six arboviruses not reported in sloths: Rio Grande (RGV), West Nile (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV), Piry (PIRYV), Munguba (MUNV), and La Crosse (LCV) viruses. Flaviviruses Among flaviviruses, we investigated expo- sure to WNV, ILHV, and SLEV, all vectored by mosquitoes (Pauvolid-Correa et al. 2013; Rivarola et al. 2014). Saint Louis encephalitis virus infects a variety of vertebrate hosts, among which sloths, primates, birds, marsu- pials, and armadillos are considered reservoirs (Seymour et al. 1983a; Figueiredo 2007). Free-ranging BTSs in Panama maintain a high SLEV antibody prevalence of 39% (Seymour et al. 1983b). Experimental infec- tion with SLEV in sloths produced a high-titer and long-lasting antibody response compared to other hosts (Seymour et al. 1983a). Sloths are relatively poor amplification hosts after mosquito inoculation compared to chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) or mice (Mus musculus; Seymour et al. 1983a). Despite low transmission, because sloths are relatively common in Central American forests (Eisen- berg and Thorington 1973; Montgomery and Sunquist 1978), they are considered important hosts in the transmission of SLEV. Alphaviruses Some alphaviruses are emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, VEEV, MAYV, and EEEV (Figueiredo 2007; Cassadou et al. 2014; Fischer and Staples 2014; Horcada et al. 2015). Three of these (VEEV, EEEV, and MAYV) are zoonotic and widespread in South America (Hubalek et al. 2014). Mayaro virus causes epidemics of febrile exanthematous illness in humans in Latin America, often accompanied by arthralgia (Woodall 1967; de Thoisy et al. 2003). It is a major arboviral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and relevant to public health in rural South America (de Thoisy et al. 2003; Figueiredo 2007; Figueiredo and Figueiredo 2014). Sloths with MAYV antibody have been reported in French Guyana (de Thoisy et al. 2003) but not in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). Orthobunyaviruses La Crosse virus is one of the four primary causes of zoonotic encephalitis in the US (Go et al. 2014). Humans are considered dead-end hosts (Smith et al. 2006; Go et al. 2014) but, when symptomatic, frequently present with influenza-like clinical signs and encephalitis (Go et al. 2014). No disease is documented in animals. Prevalence of LCV antibodies has not been studied in sloths. Rio Grande virus is a member of the phlebotomus fever group. The primary vector is the hematophagous sand fly Lutzomyia anthophora (Endris et al. 1983). This virus has not been investigated in sloths. Oropouche virus is a zoonotic Orthobunya- virus causing acute Oropouche fever (Figueir- edo 2007). The sylvatic cycle includes sloths as reservoirs and mosquitoes as vectors (Pinheiro et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007). The urban cycle involves humans with Culex quinquefasciatus 884 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 52, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis and Culicoides paraensis midges as vectors (Pinheiro et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007). Oropouche virus was described in Brazil in 1960, when it was isolated from a pale- throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridacty- lus) captured near a forested area during construction of the Belem-Brasilia highway (Woodall 1967). Utinga virus has been documented in pale- throated three-toed sloth in Utinga forest, Belem, Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Punta Toro virus is a rare zoonotic virus causing febrile illness in humans and vectored by sand flies Lutzomyia spp. (Seymour et al. 1983c). It was studied as a model for Rift Valley fever infection in laboratory animals (Ashley et al. 2011) and has been used as a vaccine candidate against Rift Valley fever (Lihorado- va et al. 2013). Murutucu virus was isolated from a BTS in Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Phleboviruses Rio Grande virus is a member of the phlebotomus fever group and has not been investigated in sloths. The primary vector is the hematophagous sand fly, Lutzomyia an- thophora (Endris et al. 1983). A Munguba virus antibody-positive HTS was found in Monte Dourado, Jari, Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Orbiviruses Changuinola virus is a rare zoonotic orbivi- rus with only one reported case of febrile human disease (Woodall 1967). The primary vector in Brazil and Panama is the sandfly, Lutzomyia umbratilis (Woodall 1967). Anti- body-positive sloths have been reported in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983a, b) and Brazil (Gilmore et al. 2001) and are believed to be reservoirs for this virus (Seymour et al. 1983c). Vesiculoviruses Vesicular stomatitis is a reportable disease to the Office International des Epizooties. Sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.) and black flies (Simulium spp.) are vectors (Comer et al. 1990; Cupp et al. 1992; Mead 2006). Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) are suspect- ed to be a maintenance host for VSV (Trujillo et al. 2010), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) may represent an amplifying host (Mead 2006). Although VSV may cause a flu-like disease in humans (Mead 2006), the primary concern is to livestock in the agrarian regions of Costa Rica (Atwill et al. 1993). Panamanian sloths have been found to be antibody positive for VSV Indiana serotype by plaque reduction neutralization test, with 32% of Choloepus spp. and 15% of Bradypus spp. antibody positive (Tesh et al. 1969). Antibodies against Piry virus have been identified in a wide variety of mammals (Wilks and House 1984) including Xenarthra in Brazil with 8.8% antibody prevalence (CDC 2014). MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected blood samples from two sloth species inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica between July and August in 2005–07. We chose two locations corresponding with ongoing wildlife research projects tracking the movement of free- ranging sloths. The primary location used for capture was Finmac, a 107-ha organic cacao plantation in northeastern Costa Rica (10820 00N, 83820 00W), surrounded by banana and pineapple plantations and pastures. The second location, used for collection in 2007 only, was a cacao plantation outside of the community of Upala (108540N, 85820W), surrounded by pasture, sparse forest, and pineapple plantations. Participants included wildlife biologists, veterinarians, and veterinary students from the Universidad Nacio- nal (Heredia, Costa Rica) and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora permits and local permis- sions were obtained for sample collection. All procedures in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin. Sloths were captured manually, placed in burlap sacks, and transported to a consistent location before being anesthetized as described by Hanley et al. (2008). Time between capture and release did not exceed 12 h. Capture location was documented for each sloth by GPS to ensure return to the original capture site. After transpor- tation, each sloth was immobilized with medeto- midine 0.02 mg/kg (1 mg/mL; Domitort, Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, Pennsylvania, USA) and MEDLIN ET AL.—PATHOGENS IN FREE-RANGING SLOTHS IN COSTA RICA 885 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis ketamine hydrochloride 2.5 mg/kg (100 mg/mL; Ketavett, Revetmex, Colonia Prado Churubsco, Deleg, Coyoacan, Mexico). Anesthetic monitoring was performed by one of the investigators (C.S.H.) and included respiratory rate and heart rate via Doppler flow probe and stethoscope. A full physical exam was completed. Blood samples were collected from the cephalic, saphenous, or femoral veins, or the cranial vena cava, and preserved in 2.0 mL heparinized tubes. Blood samples were centrifuged within 60 min of collection, and serum was placed in 1.8 mL plastic microtainers (Nalgene screw-top, Lima, Ohio, USA), and kept in an ice chest until frozen at �4 C. Each sloth had a passive integrated transponder (ID 100US, Trovan Ltd., Santa Barbara, California, USA) implanted subcutane- ously in the interscapular region to prevent resampling during the same year. Prior to recovery, each sloth received 20–100 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution (Hospira, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) subcutaneously. Atipame- zole 0.1 mg/kg was administered intramuscularly to antagonize medetomidine. After complete recovery, sloths were released at their capture site. Frozen sera were transported to the Univer- sity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, US, for testing. Serologic testing Hemaglutination inhibition (HI) test: Sera were tested for antibodies to EEEV, ILHV, MAYV, MUNV, MURV, OROV, RGV, SLEV, UTIV, and VEEV. The HI tests were performed in microtiter plates as described by Shope (1963). Nonspecific inhibitors of sera were acetone extracted by a classical technique (Clarke and Casals 1958). To remove goose cell agglutinins, rehydrated sera (pH 9.0 borate saline) were adsorbed with goose cells. Tests were performed with 4 units of antigen, obtained by sucrose acetone extraction and inactivated by treatment with betapropiolac- tone, against 1:10 serum dilution used for screening. Complement fixation (CF) test: Sera were screened for antibodies to six arbovirus antigens: ILHV, SLEV, LCV, PTV, CGLV, and PIRYV. Testing by CF was performed using a micro- technique following Beaty et al. (1989). The highest dilutions giving 3þ or 4þ fixation of complement (scale of 0–4) were recorded as positive, and a positive result for the 1:10 dilution was considered antibody positive. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT): All sera SLEV- and VEEV-positive by HI were tested by PRNT to confirm specificity using strains T35573 and 68U201, respectively. In addition, sera were tested for WNV and VSV using strains NY99 and Mudd-Summers, respec- tively. Serum samples were serially diluted and incubated with 100 plaque-forming units of virus before inoculation onto confluent Vero cells as described by Seymour et al. (1983c). Serologic test variability depending on the year: Due to test availability and financial limitations, some tests were conducted only in some years. We investigated the presence of antibodies to SLEV, VEEV, ILHV, OROV, MAYV, MURV, and WNV every year. In 2007 the VEEV HI test was refined to detect specific antibodies against the subtype I variant AB, typically responsible for epizootic outbreaks, and subtype II. In 2007 PRNT was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies against VEEV subtype I variant E. The VSV PRNT was conducted in 2005 and 2007. Serologic testing for CGLV, UTIV, PIRYV, and LCV was conducted in 2005 and 2006 but not in 2007. Serologic testing for PTV and MUNV was performed only in 2005, and RGV and EEEV were tested only in 2007. Statistical analysis Yearly antibody prevalence for each virus was calculated by dividing the total number of antibody-positive animals by the total number of sloths sampled, including sloths resampled each year. Statistical tests were conducted using GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Califor- nia, USA). Differences between sampling loca- tions were evaluated with Fisher’s exact test. For arboviruses evaluated during multiple years, differences between years were also evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. For all tests, statistical significance was set at P,0.05. RESULTS From 2005 to 2007, we collected 109 blood samples from 94 adult free-ranging sloths, including 26 BTSs and 68 HTSs. We collected 45 samples in 2005, 43 in 2006, and 21 in 2007. During physical examinations of 95 sloths, ticks, flies, and moths were present on most sloths. All sloths recovered from anesthesia uneventfully. Serologic results for the 109 samples are detailed in Table 1, and antibody titers are summarized in Table 2. Overall, via HI and CF techniques, 87 of the 109 samples (80%) were positive for antibody to SLEV. Preva- lences of detectable antibody to other viruses were IHLV: 73/109 (67%), PTV: 12/37 (32%), CGLV: 26/88 (30%), WNV: 12/82 (15%), VEEV: 12/109 (11%), VSV: 10/109 (9%), and 886 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 52, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis RGV: 2/21 (10%). Nine of 66 samples (14%) were positive for VSV by PRNT. Antibodies to WNV, VSV, and CGLV were detected only in BTSs. There were no detectable antibodies found during any sampling period for the remaining eight viruses. We sampled 13 sloths during 2 yr, and one sloth during all 3 yr. Among the recaptured sloths, 7/13 had a consistent titer for SLEV, three had increasing titers, two had decreas- ing titers, and one was antibody negative during the 3-yr sampling period. Discrepancies were found between the results of the HI assays and PRNT80 in four of 12 serum samples for VEEV and in 41 of 87 positive samples for SLEV antibody. In all cases, sera were positive for VEEV or SLEV antibodies via HI, but negative via PRNT80. Because the PRNT is considerably more specific, the results obtained by HI in these cases could reflect cross-reactions with other, unknown viruses. All of these sloths were negative for WNV and SLEV antibodies by PRNT80. Antibodies to VEEV were found at both locations, and in both sloth species. During 2006 none of the BTSs were antibody positive. During 2007, two of three BTSs from the Upala plantation had antibody to VEEV enzootic subtype IE. Three of four HTSs positive for VEEV-IE antibody during 2007 did not have measurable titers for either subtype IAB or II. The remaining HTS had a higher titer for VEEV-IE antibody than TABLE 1.

Antibody to Rio Grande virus was detected in two of 21 individuals via HI in 2007 (Table 2). The positive sloths were one female adult HTS at Finmac and one female adult BTS at Upala. We analyzed changes in antibody preva- lence for a few viruses. Between 2005 and 2007 there were no significant variations in prevalence of antibodies to ILHV or SLEV in either sloth species (P¼0.16–1.0). Between 2005 and 2007, a significant increase in VSV antibody prevalence was determined in HTSs, from 4% to 44% (P¼0.001). Between 2005 and 2006, a significant increase in WNV antibody prevalence from 8% to 27% was measured in HTSs, (P,0.001) while no WNV antibody- positive BTSs were detected in either year. Regarding variations between sloth species, antibody prevalence was significantly higher in HTSs compared to BTSs for SLEV and ILHV in 2005 (P¼0.008), whereas in 2006 and 2007, prevalence was not significantly differ- ent between sloth species for any of the screened antibodies. For VEEV and RGV antibodies, no significant difference was detected between sloth species. When com- paring locations, there were no significant differences in prevalence for any antibodies. DISCUSSION We conducted comprehensive serologic testing in sloths in Costa Rica, confirming exposure of sloth populations to, at least, eight arboviruses. Rio Grande virus Rio Grande virus was detected in two of 21 sloths but was evaluated only in 2007. These may represent a cross reaction with a closely related Phlebovirus or might be true positives. This virus cross-reacts only rarely with other TABLE 2.

To date, RGV has been isolated in Texas (Calisher et al. 1977) and Mexico (Deardorff et al. 2011). Sand flies are vectors of RGV and VSV (Mead 2006), so the presence of these vectors in Costa Rica (Jimenez et al. 2000a) might be associated with transmission of both viruses being described in Costa Rican sloths. Punta Toro virus We detected antibody to PTV in 12 of 37 HTSs evaluated only in 2006. Antibodies against PTV were found in BTSs (8/106) and HTSs (11/66) in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983c). Unfortunately, PTV and RGV anti- bodies were not tested during the same years, and it was not possible to determine whether some RGV antibody-positive sloths could also be positive for PTV antibody. This requires further evaluation. Vesicular stomatitis virus Costa Rica is endemic for VSV (Jimenez et al. 2000b). Similar to a previous study in Panama (Tesh et al. 1969), we detected sloths with antibody for the VSV Indiana serotype. Production of neutralizing anti- bodies results in cessation of virus shedding (Mead 2006). Although this has not been investigated specifically in xenarthrans, the antibody-positive sloths we detected are unlikely to represent a source of infection for other animals. In addition, experimental studies have shown that biting insects become infected with VSV when feeding on or near virus-rich vesicular lesions (Mead 2006), none of which were observed on physical examinations of VSV antibody-pos- itive sloths. No sloths had detectable anti- body to PIRYV, which rules out a cross- reaction between these two vesiculoviruses. We found that prevalence of antibody to VSV increased significantly in HTSs between 2005 and 2007. In addition, all antibody- positive sloths were from Finmac, which could reflect the involvement of environ- mental factors. Climatic conditions in be- tween sampling areas are different, and weather variability is also expected in the same area each year due to the El Niño southern oscillation. These environmental parameters could have affected multiple serologic results. Further work is needed to investigate whether VSV can have an impact on free-ranging sloth populations and wheth- er contact with domestic animals is a factor associated with seroconversion. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus Six viral species were described within the VEE complex (Go et al. 2014), and multiple variants were described within VEEV, among which subtypes 1AB and 1C are involved in equine epizootic outbreaks (Kinney et al. 1992). Bradypus and Choloepus spp. indi- viduals with antibody to VEEV have been described in Panama (Grayson and Galindo 1969; Seymour 1985). Following experimen- tal infection, BTSs develop high titers, similar to rodents, which are considered the most important enzootic hosts (Carrara et al. 2007), and their viremias last 5–6 times longer than in Choloepus spp. Seymour (1985) suggested that BTSs could be an amplifying host for VEEV (Seymour 1985). In South America, reservoir and amplifying hosts in the VEEV enzootic cycle are unknown but may include rodents and birds (Arrigo et al. 2010; Go et al. 2014). In 2007, two of three BTSs collected at the Upala plantation had antibody to VEEV-IE. One of these sloths also had a low titer for both VEEV-IAB and VEEV-II. Considering the higher titer for subtype IE, the lower titers for subtype IAB and subtype II were most likely due to cross-reactivity of the antibody responses or to the different serologic test (PRNT versus HI). A similar observation was made on one of the four positive HTSs. The VEEV antibody prevalence did not change significantly between 2006 and 2007 at Finmac, suggesting an enzootic virus or long lasting immunity. It was not possible to evaluate this hypothesis at the individual level as no sloth captured in multiple years was VEEV antibody positive.

This was similar to the findings of Seymour et al. (1983c) of 42.4% Choloepus spp. and 5.2% Bradypus spp. Changuinola virus antibody prevalence in Panama. This prevalence sup- ports the theory that the primary hosts for this virus are Choloepus spp. sloths. Ilheus virus We found 67% of sloths had antibody to ILHV compared to 2% in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b) and 4% in Brazil (Woodall 1967). These differences could be due to different serologic assays, locations, or years. In our study, individual animals’ titers to ILHV antibody were always higher than the ILHV antibody titer using the same samples. In addition, of the 73 samples positive for ILHV antibody, all were also positive for SLEV antibody, in lower titers (�4), suggesting that HI and CF results may cross-react for SLEV. A cross-reaction between SLEV and ILHV antibodies via HI and CF would also explain that more HTSs than BTSs had detectable antibody to both viruses. St. Louis encephalitis virus Annual prevalence of antibodies to SLEV in sloths in Costa Rica using HI ranged 29–67% in BTSs, and from 78% to 89% in HTSs in our study, which appeared higher than those reported from Choloepus spp. And Bradypus spp. in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). However, when considering PRNT as the most specific serologic technique to detect seroconversion to SLEV, only 53% of the positive samples were considered true posi- tives (46 of 87 positive samples by HI), decreasing the antibody prevalence of to 42%. This result is similar to the prevalence of 46% reported by PRNT in Choloepus spp. in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). For SLEV, our results were consistent with previous studies on antibody prevalences in sloths in Central and South America (Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c; Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al. 2001). In 2005, antibody prevalences were signif- icantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs, similar to findings in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b), whereas prevalences were not significantly di"

LEACH 1 1 Health Protection Agency, Centre for Emergency Preparedness & Response, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK 2 School of Health & Bioscience, University of East London, London, UK (Accepted 30 May 2006; first published online 8 August 2006) SUMMARY Nine different arboviruses are known to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses) are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease. Although there have been no reported human cases in Great Britain (GB), there have been no published in-depth serological surveys for evidence of human infection. This paper investigates the ecological and entomological factors that could influence or restrict transmission of these viruses in GB, suggesting that in addition to West Nile virus, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses could exist in enzootic cycles, and that certain ecological factors could facilitate transmission to humans. However, the level of transmission is likely to be lower than in endemic foci elsewhere in Europe due to key ecological differences related to spatial and temporal dynamics of putative mosquito vectors and presence of key reservoir hosts. Knowledge of the potential GB-specific disease ecology can aid assessments of risk from mosquito-borne arboviruses. INTRODUCTION There is currently considered to be no transmission of mosquito-borne arboviruses to humans in Great Britain (GB), despite a number of mosquito-borne arboviruses being endemic in other parts of Europe, where they cause human disease. However, to date no in-depth serological surveys for mosquito-borne viruses in the GB human population have been pub- lished, and therefore an assessment of their possible ecology and epidemiology is required to aid under- standing as to whether these viruses already exist enzootically in GB and whether they could be associ- ated with human infection. A number of papers have reviewed the known transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne arboviruses endemic in Europe [1–3], with suggestions that they may occur enzootically in the United Kingdom (UK) [4]. Following the large-scale outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America and recent outbreaks in Romania, Russia, Israel and France, an inves- tigation into the presence of mosquito-borne viruses in GB was conducted, resulting in evidence of neutralizing antibodies to WNV, Sindbis virus and Usutu virus in British resident birds [5]. Prior to this, the only previous record of a mosquito-borne arbovirus in GB was serological evidence of Tahyna virus in small mammals in Devon [6]. The recent spread of WNV across North America, coupled with seropositivity in British resident birds have led to the development of UK contingency plans for WNV [7] and vector control [8]. The occurrence and abundance of mosquito vector species, or potential vector species, is a prerequisite for enzootic transmission of mosquito-borne viruses in GB.

Several species (Ae. vexans, An. algeriensis, Cx. modestus, Cs. longiareolata, Cs. alas- kaensis, Oc. communis, Oc. leucomelas, Oc. sticticus and Or. pulcripalpis) are either rare, adopt localized distributions or have only historically occurred in GB and can therefore be generally discounted from eco-epidemiological studies of mosquito-borne arbo- virus transmission in GB. An ecological understand- ing of candidate mosquito vectors of arboviruses is an important aspect of surveillance and aids assess- ment of likely spatio-temporal dynamics of trans- mission and associated public health risks. A detailed review of the ecology of candidate WNV mosquito vectors in the British Isles based upon known vector status in continental Europe and host preferences of endemic species has been published [9]. The main aims of this paper are to assess the ecological potential for transmission of other mosquito-borne arboviruses in GB and associated public health concerns and secondly, by incorporating data on distribution from the British mosquito recording scheme to identify areas for possible transmission and more importantly targeted surveillance of potentially medically import- ant arboviruses including WNV#. Mosquito-borne arboviruses in Europe Up to 1996, eight arboviruses transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes had been recorded in Europe (Table 2; [2]) including: members of the Togaviridae (Sindbis), Flaviviridae (West Nile, dengue), and Bunyaviridae (Batai, Inkoo, Lednice, Tahyna and Uukuniemi) ; Usutu virus has since been added to this list [13]. Five of these arboviruses are generally associated with human disease in Europe: Sindbis, West Nile, Tahyna, Batai and Inkoo. The public health concerns for GB will now be considered in more depth. Sindbis virus (SINV) SINV (Togaviridae: Alphavirus) was first isolated from Cx. univittatus near Sindbis village, Egypt in 1952, with the first human case reported in Uganda in 1961. SINV has since been isolated from Africa, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Australia; however, it only appears to be clinically apparent in northern Europe (mainly 60x–64x N) and in South Africa [14]. In Scandinavia, infection with SINV or SIN-like viruses is known by different names in different regions: Ockelbo disease in Sweden, Karelian fever in western Russia, and Pogosta disease in Finland. There have been no fatal human cases reported and many SIN or SIN-like virus infections are mod- erate or mild, especially in children and adolescents, so the potential exists for under-reporting and/or under-diagnosis [15]. There appears to be more sub- clinical infections than clinical cases with reported ratios of 20:1 to 40:1 in Sweden and 17:1 in Finland [16, 17]. However, where clinical disease in humans does occur the infection is characterized by fever, rash and arthritis, with non-pruritic skin lesions beginning as macules, which become papular and progress to central vesicle formation, which are, occasionally, haemorrhagic [18]. Arthralgias occur in large and small joints, particularly ankles, wrists and knees [19] and may be so severe as to be immobilizing [20] with moderate joint pain and stiff- ness persisting for months or years, with chronic joint (or muscle) problems occurring in y20% of cases [20]. Following the first human case in Sweden in the 1960s, Ockelbo disease was responsible for considerable morbidity in Scandinavia during the 1980s. In 1981, the Russian federation and Finland reported 200 and 300 laboratory-confirmed cases of Karelian fever and Pogosta disease respectively [21]. The largest Pogosta disease outbreak occurred in Finland in 1995 with 400 confirmed cases. Annual incidence rates in endemic regions of affected countries range from 2.7/100 000 in Finland, 2.9/ 100 000 in Sweden to 18/100 000 in northern Karelia [16, 17]. Epidemics can involve hundreds of people, and in these epidemic years, the number of cases may be 10 times higher than in non-epidemic years. The annual number of cases in Finland from 1980 to 1996 ranged from 1 to 1282 [17]. Human disease normally appears at the end of July or beginning of August, peaks in late August with few cases from October [16]. A virus closely related to SINV (Ockelbo virus) was first isolated from mosquitoes of the genus Culiseta # Although currently available distribution maps do not represent a complete picture of the distribution of British mosquitoes [10], they provide, through the combination of recorded distributions of potential vectors, an insight into areas where transmission might occur and therefore assist in targeting surveillance of arboviral transmission. It should be borne in mind, however, that other areas not illustrated on these maps could be suitable for transmission of these arboviruses and the development of geospatial risk maps would be useful. However, incorporating a number of different mosquito species that favour a variety of diverse ecologies would be complex.

During studies in Sweden [23], SIN-like virus was only iso- lated from mosquitoes collected during July and August with highest ‘minimum field infection rates ’ (MFIR) reported in August. The monthly MFIR for Cx. pipiens/Cx. torrentium (5.0/1000 in July, 12.6/ 1000 in August) was consistently higher than in Cs. morsitans (2.0/1000 in July, 4.1/1000 in August), with Ae. cinereus exhibiting aMFIR of 0.3/1000 in August. This suggests that Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium are potential enzootic vectors among birds mainly from late spring to mid-summer, with Cs. morsitans as a potential additional enzootic vector in late summer [27, 28], and Ae. cinereus as a potential bridge vector for transmission from viraemic birds to humans. The relative roles of pipiens and torrentium as enzootic vectors was investigated by orally infecting both species with a range of doses of virus and after an incubation period testing the mosquito’s ability to transmit [29]. Culex torrentium was highly susceptible to Ockelbo virus by the oral route and transmitted the virus effectively to chickens. One of two mosquitoes that ingested a blood meal containing <102 p.f.u./ml became infected, and all mosquitoes that ingested a blood meal containing >104 p.f.u./ml became in- fected. All 10 re-feeding Cx. torrentium transmitted Ockelbo virus to susceptible chickens. In contrast only one of 28 Cx. pipiens was infected after ingestion of a blood meal of 103 .0–3.9 p.f.u./ml, with the fre- quency of infection increasing to 53% after ingestion of 106 p.f.u./ml. Transmission rates were correlated positively with the virus concentration but were much lower in pipiens than torrentium, and it seems clear that Cx. torrentium is an efficient laboratory vector, and that Cx. pipiens was relatively refractory and a poor vector. Similar competence experiments with SINV/SIN-like virus in Swedish Aedes species showed that Ae. cinereus was relatively susceptible to infection and could transmit the virus [30]. Based on virus occurrence in wild mosquitoes and the results of experimental infection and transmission studies, it is clear that Cx. torrentium is the main vector for Table 2.

The main enzootic vector Cx. torrentium and the potential enzootic mosquito vector Cs. morsitans are present and abundant in GB. The potential, but probably not very important enzootic vector Cx. pipiens is also present and abundant in GB. The two Culex species are almost morphologically indis- tinguishable, with very few bionomic differences, both being strongly ornithophagic, occupying similar larval habitats such as ponds, marshes, backwaters of streams, hoof prints, pools, ditches and water- containing tree-holes, tanks, butts and discarded tyres [9, 32, 33]. Whilst Cx. pipiens (nominate ornitho- phagic biotype) is widespread across GB, Cx. torren- tium occurs mainly in southern England, where it predominates over Cx. pipiens in peri-domestic habi- tats. Human biting has rarely been recorded in either species and their roles as bridge vectors is considered negligible. Similarly Cs. morsitans is predominantly ornithophagic, and although there is documented evidence of biting of humans [34], this behaviour is considered rare. Transmission to humans is due to involvement of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes with less specialized feeding habits. In Sweden, human infection with SINV appears to occur where enzootic cycles with Cx. torrentium exist, and where large numbers of Ae. cinereus can facilitate the transmission to humans. Aedes cinereus has a widespread but patchy distri- bution across mainland Britain and, where it is locally common, is a troublesome biter of humans [33]. Aquatic sites include areas prone to freshwater summer flooding with females biting a variety of mammals including humans. Other aedine mos- quitoes in GB that might be suggested as potential bridge vectors include Oc. cantans and Oc. communis [24, 27]. The latter has only been recorded on a few occasions [10] whereas the former is widespread and patchily abundant in woods and scrublands across most of GB. The ecologies of all six mosquito species are detailed in Table 3 and their known distributions are illustrated in Figure 1(a, b). In Sweden, passeriformes appear to be the principal vertebrate hosts for Ockelbo virus (neutralizing anti- bodies in 27% passeriformes, 6% galliformes, 4% anseriformes) [35]. In a later study, SINV appeared to infect almost all passerine species with prevalence rates of neutralizing bodies to SINV reported as 6.6% in Erithacus rubecula (robin), 12.8% in Turdus merulaT a b le 3 .

The ubiquity of these species and other passerine birds in GB suggests that the lack of reservoir hosts may not be a limiting factor. However, three species of thrush in Sweden reported the highest prevalence rates : 43.3% in Tu. pilaris (fieldfare), 22.2% in Tu. philomelos (song thrush) and 37.0% in Tu. iliacus (redwing), with the conclusion that these three bird species are likely to be the main amplification hosts for SINV in Sweden. The authors concluded that the relative abundance of these three species relative to all other bird species was important in the virus dynamics at a particular site, concluding that the main endemic area for SINV in Europe (i.e. Scandinavia) is closely and positively associated with the abundance of these thrush species. The restricted distribution of clinically apparent disease between 60x N and 64x N may, therefore, be a function of the presence of large numbers of these virus-amplifying hosts during the summer mosquito season, as well as perhaps a climate restriction of the virus. In Finland however, 30% of game birds had SINV antibodies in 1981–1983 and during the large epi- demic of Pogosta disease in 1981, 65% of Tetrao species (black grouse Tetrao tetrix and capercaillie Te. urogallus) were seropositive. Coupled with the high titres in capercaille [35] it is postulated [17] that the epidemic years of Pogosta disease every 7th year in Finland are linked to the 6- to 7-year cycle of tetraonid birds and that cycling of the herd immunity among birds causes the 7-year interval of human SINV epidemics in Finland. The three bird species implicated as main amplifi- cation hosts in Sweden occur in GB but unlike Sweden, neither Tu. pilaris, nor Tu. iliacus breed in GB in any large numbers during the summer months (1–5 and 30–50 breeding pairs respectively [37]). In fact Tu. pilaris and Tu. iliacus are primarily winter visitors to GB arriving from their Scandinavian breeding sites in large numbers (750 000 birds each) from October onwards. The diversity of passerine hosts present in GB suggest that based purely on (a) (b) Fig. 1.

This is supported by serological evidence from GB [5] with the highest seroprevalence in Tu. merula (blackbird; 56%, n=9), Corvus corone (carrion crow; 62%, n=26), and Pica pica (magpie; 51%, n=45), with evidence of SINV-neutralizing antibodies in sera from a further seven wild and domestic birds from GB collected in 2001 and 2002. However, assuming that a similar involvement of thrushes in virus amplification is required in GB, the absence of large numbers of Tu. pilaris and Tu. iliacus in GB during the summer mosquito season may limit the amplification of the virus in resident birds and hence limit the possibility for large outbreaks of human disease. Where SINV may occur in resident passer- ines, any subsequent transmission to humans in GB would probably be spatially restricted to areas with large numbers of both Cx. torrentium and Ae. cinereus mosquitoes, with human cases likely to correlate with the seasonality of the main bridge vector, in July and August (areas where these mosquito vectors do appear to coincide is illustrated in Fig. 1). Regarding the possible involvement of tetraonid birds in virus cycles (as in Finland), neither Te. tetrix nor Te. urogallus occur in Britain in any significant numbers (both priority conservation species) and it therefore seems that a similar cycle to that seen in Finland occurring in GB is unlikely. Other members of the family Tetraonidae do occur in GB, for example Lagopus lagopus (red grouse) is abundant in parts of Scotland, however, there is no evidence linking this species to SINV [17]. West Nile virus (WNV) Recent animal and human WNV outbreaks in the Mediterranean basin and the United States are de- scribed in detail elsewhere [38–41]. The background to WNV (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) epidemiology and detailed ecologies of candidate enzootic and bridge vectors in relation to the British Isles have also been discussed in detail [9, 42] and reference should be made to these articles. However, a summary table of candidate mosquito species that could be implicated in transmission of WNV in GB is provided in Table 4 and the possible spatial dynamics of transmission based upon known records of mosquito distributions are detailed in Figure 2. Regarding seasonality of transmission to humans, due to the large spectrum of potential mosquito vectors, transmission could feasibly occur between May and October, however, it is likely to be elevated during the summer months of July, August and early September. Tahyna virus (TAHV) Tahyna virus (Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus) belongs to the California complex of bunyaviruses. TAHV was first isolated in 1958 in Slovakia from Ae. vexans and Oc. caspius [43], and has subsequently been reported from France, Austria, Czechland, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and other parts of the former USSR [2, 3, 31, 44], as well in Asia and Africa. Serosurveys of small mammals around Exeter, south-western England [6], found that Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse) and Clethrionomys glareolus (bank vole) had antibodies to TAHV. According to the World Health Organization [45], TAHV-infected humans may present with influenza- like symptoms, and sometimes as meningoencephali- tis and atypical pneumonia. No fatal cases have been reported, and many infections are unapparent, de- spite high antibody prevalences (60–80%) among inhabitants of endemic foci. Symptomatic cases manifest as an acute influenza-like disease (more common in children) with sudden onset of fever lasting 3–5 days, with headache, malaise, conjuncti- vitis, pharyngitis, myalgia, nausea, gastrointestinal disorders, anorexia and occasional arthralgia [46]. In Slovakia, every seventieth case of febrile illness in children and every fifth case of CNS illness in children is caused by TAHV [47], and in Czechland every seventh influenza case and every fifth case with manifestations of meningoencephalitis in the summer months can be ascribed to this virus [48]. WHO states that ‘ inasmuch that TAHV is widespread in Europe and may cause severe disease, it must be considered of public health importance at present, bearing in mind its even greater potential for increased inci- dence, especially as its vectors are so widespread’ [45]. TAHV vectors are mainly pasture-breeding species of the genera Aedes and Ochlerotatus, with TAHV isolated from several species of mosquito including Ae. vexans,Oc. caspius (caspius/dorsalis), Ae. cinereus, Oc. cantans (cantans/annulipes), Oc. sticticus, Cs. annulata, Cx. modestus, Oc. flavescens, Coquillettidia richiardii, An. maculipennis, and Cx. pipiens [31, 46] with the most virus isolations from Ae. vexans, Oc. caspius/dorsalis, Oc. cantans/annulipes and Ae. cinereus [31].

In Europe it is generally considered that Ae. vexans seems to be a prerequisite for the maintenance of TAHV trans- mission cycles in an area. However, although the high number of TAHV isolates in Slovakia were from Ae. vexans, this is in contrast to the lack of isolates from this species in Austria where a high number of isolates from Oc. caspius/dorsalis indicates that strains of TAHV may utilize different vector species in different geographical locations. Other Aedes/Ochlerotatus species clearly do contribute to transmission, and Culiseta mosquitoes may be important in the overwintering of TAHV [46], with transovarial transmission occurring in most of these species [49]. All the mosquito species listed above have been re- corded in GB, however, the limited number of records of Oc. sticticus and Cx. modestus suggest that neither of these species would contribute significantly to transmission of the virus in GB.

Mehla-2009-Recent ancestry of Kyasanur Forest.pdf	"Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is enzootic to In- dia and maintained in ticks, mammals, and birds. It causes severe febrile illness in humans and was first recognized in 1957 associated with a high number of deaths among monkeys in Kyasanur Forest. Genetic analysis of 48 virus- es isolated in India during 1957–2006 showed low diversity (1.2%). Bayesian coalescence analysis of these sequences and those of KFDVs from Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China estimated that KFDVs have evolved at a mean rate of ≈6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year, which is similar to rates estimated for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. KFDVs were estimated to have shared a common ancestor in ≈1942, fifteen years before identification of the disease in India. These data are consistent with the view that KFD rep- resented a newly emerged disease when first recognized. Recent common ancestry of KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia, despite their large geographic separation, indicates long-range movement of virus, possibly by birds. Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a member of the mammalian tick-borne virus group (previously re- ferred to as the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup) of the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus (1). In addition to KFDV, this group contains Louping ill, tick-borne enceph- alitis, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Langat, Powassan, Royal Farm, and Gadgets Gully viruses. KFD was first recog- nized in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Shimoga District, Karnataka State, India, when a disease causing a high num- ber of deaths was observed in 2 species of monkeys: the black-faced langur (Semnopithecus entellus, earlier known as Presbytis entellus) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata). Human cases were also found among persons who visited forests to collect firewood, grass, and other forest products. Human disease is characterized by an incubation period of ≈3–8 days, followed by chills, frontal headache, body ache, and high fever for 5–12 days, and a case-fatality rate >30% (2). During infection by KFDV, virus titer re- mains high <10 days after onset of symptoms, as reported by Bhat et al. (3). However, Upadhyaya et al. (4) found that viremia in patients lasted for 12–13 days of illness and unlike most other flaviviruses, remains high during the first 3–6 days with titers as high as 3.1 × 106 PFU/mL. Continuing deaths in monkeys and an average of 400–500 human cases have been seen annually over the past 5 decades, commonly occurring in evergreen, semi- evergreen, and neighboring, moist, deciduous forest areas. An array of tick species, mainly Haemaphysalis spinigera, act as vectors for KFDV (5). This species of tick is widely distributed in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests of southern and central India and Sri Lanka. KFDV has also been isolated from 7 other species of this genus and from Dermacentor and Ixodes ticks. This disease is transmitted by ticks among ground birds and small mammals such as the white-tailed rat, white-bellied rat, shrew, and bat. High titers of virus can be obtained after experimental infection of black-napped hares, porcupines, flying squirrels, Ma- labar giant squirrels, three-striped squirrels, gerbils, mice, long-tailed tree mice, and shrews (2–9). Until 1971, KFDV was endemic to the Sagar, Sorab, and Shikaripur taluks (counties) of Shimoga District (Fig- ure 1). By 1972, a new focus of virus activity appeared in Sirsi Taluk, Uttara Kannada District. Many KFDV isolates were obtained from Karnataka during 1957–1972 and main- tained in a repository at the National Institute of Virology Recent Ancestry of Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus Rajeev Mehla, Sandeep R.P.

However, the virus was found to be highly infectious, as shown by numerous infections in field and laboratory personnel (2,10), which resulted in suspen- sion of work with this virus until an appropriate BioSafety Level-3 laboratory was built at NIV in 2004. In 2006, this laboratory isolated a virus from a serum sample of a patient suspected of having KFD that was obtained from the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory in Shimoga. More recent studies have identified KFDV in Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China (11,12). Dur- ing 1994–1995, a virus was isolated from hemorrhagic fever patients in the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia and identified as a KFDV variant, referred to as the Alkhurma variant or subgroup (11,13,14). The prototype strain of KFDV from Saudi Arabia (strain 1176, isolated in 1995) and the KFDV reference strain from India (P-9605, iso- lated in 1957) differ from each another by only 8% at the genome nucleotide level, despite their temporal (38 years) and geographic (≈4,000 km) separation. A virus initially referred to as Nanjianyin virus, isolated in 1989 from a fe- brile patient in Nanjian County in the Hengduan Mountain region of Yunnan Province in southwestern China, was re- cently identified as a strain of KFDV (12). However, it is unclear whether this KFDV 1989 isolate from China is an authentic virus isolate because it is virtually identical at the nucleotide level with the 1957 reference strain from India (P-9605), despite their being isolated 32 years and almost 3,000 km apart. The P-9605 strain was distributed widely to arbovirus reference laboratories. Reference KFDV vi- rus was used as part of the analysis of serum samples from Yunnan Province (15,16). Results of molecular epidemiologic studies have sug- gested that tick-borne flaviviruses have evolved slowly while dispersing north and west across Asian and European forests during the past few millennia (17–19). This pattern is different from that of rapidly evolving mosquito-borne flaviviruses, many of which can be transported long dis- tances by migratory birds, persons, animals, or mosquito eggs (19,20). We examined the diversity and evolution of KFDV and present data that indicated that KFDV iso- lates from India, Saudi Arabia, and China share a recent common ancestor, indicating long-range movement of this tick-borne flavivirus. In addition, we also estimated the evolution rate of KFDV and compared it with that of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Methods Virus Selection and Reverse Transcription–PCR Forty-seven representative KFDV isolates from In- dia were chosen for analysis; these isolates were obtained during 1957–1972 (Table 1). Isolates represented viruses from various host species and different geographic loca- tions in Shimoga, Uttara Kannada, and Dakshina Kannada districts, Karnataka State. One KFDV from India isolated in 2006 was also included. Lyophilized KFDV stocks were obtained from the virus repository at the NIV, India, and grown in Vero E6 cell lines. Primers for PCR and phyloge- netic analysis were designed to target regions of structural genes (premembrane/envelope) and the nonstructural pro- tein 5 (NS5) gene (viral polymerase) (Table 2). Total RNA was extracted from 250 µL of infected Vero cell lysates by using Trizol reagent (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was dissolved in 50 µL of nuclease-free water. cDNA was prepared separately for structural genes and NS5 by using avian Moloney virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, 10 pM of each gene-specific reverse primer (ER2 and R4 were used for each set of the reverse transcription reactions, respectively) and incubated at 42°C for 45 min and then 85°C for 5 min. cDNA was amplified by using 1U of Taq DNA Poly- merase, 10× PCR buffer (Invitrogen. Carslbad, CA, USA), 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10.0 pM of each primer pair as described in Table 2 in a reaction volume of 25 µL. PCR conditions included denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 1-min steps at 94°C, 55°C, and 72°C; and a 5-min extension at 72°C. Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of interest 1432 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 Figure 1.

EU293242–EU293289 and EU293290–EU293337, respectively). Multiple se- quence alignments were generated by using the MAFFT function (21) in SeaView (22). Nucleotide and amino acid proportional distances were calculated and compared for each virus with their respective date of isolation. A partition homogeneity test (23) was conducted by using PAUP* 4.0b10 (24) to demonstrate that it was not in- appropriate to analyze the 720-nt structural gene fragment and 620-nt NS5 gene fragment as a colinearized or con- catenated single sequence. Phylogenetic analysis was per- formed on the colinearized sequence from each of the 48 KFDV isolates from India (Table 1) along with the corre- sponding gene regions available in GenBank for additional KFDVs: a1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from China (EU918174, NS5 and EU918175, polyprotein) and 2 KFDVs from Saudi Arabia isolated in 1995 (AF331718) and 2004 (DQ154114). The Modeltest 3.7 software program (25) was used to examine 56 models of nucleotide substitution to determine the model most appropriate for Bayesian coalescent analy- sis of the KFDV dataset. The general time reversible evolu- tionary model incorporating invariant sites (GTR + I) was found to be the best fit to the data according to the Akaike information criterion. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted by using BEAST, BEAUTi, and Tracer analysis software (26) with the GTR + I model. Preliminary analy- ses were run for 10,000,000 generations to select the clock and demographic models most appropriate for the KFDV dataset. An analysis of the marginal likelihoods indicated that the relaxed lognormal molecular clock and constant population size model was decisively chosen (log10 Bayes factors of 3.113) for the KFDV dataset. Final data analy- sis included a Markov chain Monte Carlo chain length of 50,000,000 generations with sampling every 1,000 states. Results Comparison of nucleotide sequences of colinear- ized fragments of structural (720 nt) and NS5 (620 nt) genes of 48 KFDV isolates from India collected over the past 5 decades (Table 1) showed a low level of diversity among these viruses (GenBank accession nos. EU29242– EU29337). A maximum of 1.2% nt and 0.5% aa differ- ences were seen among these viruses; the most divergent virus was the A106 virus isolated in 2006. Most viruses were isolated during 1957–1972. That the 2006 virus iso- late is the most divergent is consistent with the 34-year gap in sampling. As expected, little diversity was seen among the virus isolates irrespective of the host, which included humans, black-faced langurs, red-faced bonnet monkeys, various tick species (H. spinigera, H. kyasanurensis, H. turturis, H. papuana kinneari, H. wellingtoni, H. formo- sensis, and Ixodes petauristae), and rodents (Rattus rattus wroghtoni and R. blanfordi) (Table 1). The sequence of the 1957 KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and strain 651521 isolated from an NIV laboratory staff member in 1965 were identical, despite their 8-year separation. How- ever, the staff member was accidently infected while han- dling reference KFDV, which provided an explanation for this anomaly. All KFDV isolates from India differed from the Alkhurma variant of KFDV (27) found in Saudi Arabia by ≈8%–9% at the nucleotide level. This finding is similar to the extent of diversity (8%) reported in a comparison of the complete genome of a KFDV isolate from India with that of an isolate from Saudi Arabia (28). In contrast, the 1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from China (12), differed by only 1 nt (1/1,320 [0.08%]) from the 1957 KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and the labo- ratory infection strain 651521. It is notable that of the 48 KFDV strains from India analyzed, the KFDV strain from China should be most similar to strain P9605, a reference strain that was distributed worldwide to arbovirus refer- ence laboratories. The KFDV 1989 isolate from China is virtually identical at the nucleotide level to the 1957 ref- erence strain (P9605) from India, despite their being iso- lated 32 years and almost 3,000 km apart, which suggests that the strain from China is not an authentic virus isolate. A reference KFDV from India appears to have been used in the analysis of serum samples from Yunnan Province (15,16), which suggests a potential source of laboratory cross-contamination.

Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (EU918174 for NS5 and EU918175 for the polyprotein) of the KFDV isolate reportedly from China appear to contain several sequence analysis errors; neither fragment encodes a functional protein because of creation of a stop codon and 2 frame shifts relative to KFDV reference sequences (AY323490 and EU480689). Bayesian coalescent analysis of sequence differences among the 48 KFDV isolates from India (1957–2006), the isolates from Saudi Arabia (1995–2004) (28,29), and the reported isolate from China (1989) (12) was conducted to estimate the rate of evolution and time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for these viruses (Figure 2). These viruses were estimated to be evolving at a mean rate of 6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year (95% highest probable density [HPD] 4.1–8.8 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year). This estimate is similar to rates for other flaviviruses analyzed by using similar Bayesian coalescent methods, including a rate of 2.17 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year obtained for 23 St. Louis encephalitis viruses collected during 1933–2001 (30) and a rate of 4.2 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year for yellow fever virus (31). The finding of similar evolutionary rates for tick-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses was unex- pected, given earlier assertions that evolution of tick-borne viruses was more gradual than rapidly evolving mosquito- borne viruses (19). Analysis estimated that the mean time to the MRCA for all the KFDV isolates was only 64 years (95% HPD 51– 84 years) before 2006 (the year when the most contempo- rary virus was isolated). The analysis estimated that these viruses shared a common ancestor as recently as ≈1942. Analysis of only KFDV isolates from India provides a slightly more recent estimate of their MRCA (≈1948), just 9 years before identification of the disease in Kyasanur For- est in 1957. This finding correlates well with the perception of local villagers and healthcare providers in the Kyasa- nur Forest area that this was a newly emerged disease (32). Massive deaths of monkeys or compatible human disease in the region were not reported before the 1957 disease out- break. In the initial years, disease activity was reported in a limited area of ≈100 km2 in Sagar and Sorab taluks of Shimoga District. However, after 1972, epizootics and epi- demics were recognized in several new foci, increasingly more distant from the original focus. Discussion Most viruses analyzed were isolated in various small hamlets from migrating persons within the early enzoot- ic zone in the Shimoga District (until 1972). Attempts to examine the relationship between genetic differences in a virus isolate relative to geographic location did not show any notable findings because of small differences and dis- tances involved. However, the 1972 virus 72166 was iso- lated from a tick in the village of Gadgeri in Sirsi (Uttara Kannada District), which is north of Shimoga District. The 2006 virus A106 was isolated from a person south of Shi- moga District, in Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada District) and further from the original virus epicenter (Figure 1). Although much of the topology of the virus phylogenetic tree generated by Bayesian coalescent analysis is poorly supported (nodal support posterior probability values <95), there is support for a branch that contains the 72166 1972 and the A106 2006 virus isolates (Figure 2). These data suggest that there may be an association between virus ge- netic divergence and temporal and geographic spread of KFDV in Karnataka, consistent with the concept of virus spreading over time from an initial focus of activity. Why this initial focus of virus activity occurred in this location and at this time remains unclear, but speculation includes emergence of the virus from a cryptic forest cycle caused by Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 1435 0.02 G27678 (H. spinigera/Koppalgadde/1959) 67965 (Human/Sagar/1967) P21092 (Human/Hadapsar/1959) 692156 (H. spinigera/Chikkanallur/1969) 601203 (Human/Tudikoppa/1960) 623969 (Human/lab infection/1969) 601011 (Human/Chikkasakuna/1960) 642034 (H. turturis/1964) 612057 (Rattus rattus wroughtoni/Barur/1961) 652980 (Haemaphysalis spp./Vadnala/1965) 652 (H. wellingtoni/Kangodu/1965) 68142 (P. entellus/Holagalale/1968) 651521 (Human/lab infection/1965) 68484 (R. blanfordi/Holagalale/1968) 62844 (H. spinigera/Hillemarur/1962) 6616 (P. entellus/Yelagalale/1966) 681960 (Human/Barur/1968) 712419 (H. spinigera/Nodahalli/1971) 64350 (H. formosensis/Marasa/1964) 1176 (Human/Jeddah, Saudi Arabia/1995) 62849 (R. r. wroughtoni/Hillemarur/1962) 62957 (Human/Hillemarur/1962) 673514 (H. p. kinneari/Siravala/1967) W6178 (P. entellus/Koppalgadde/1959) A106 (Human/Mangalore/2006) 664518 (H. turturis/Kondagalale/1966) W379 (Presbytis entellus/Baragi/1957) G11333 (H. spinigera/Barasi/1957) W1930 (P. entellus/Chimnoor/1958) Nanjianyin (Human/Nanjian County, Yunnan Province, China/1989) 716810 (H. spinigera/Gunjur/1971) 692163 (Human/Thonagodu/1969) 68159 (H. turturis/Siravala/1967) P16011 (Human/Kaisodi/1959) JE7 (Ornithodoros savignyi/ Jeddah, Saudi Arabia/2004) 611661 (Haemaphysalis turturis/Sagar/1961) P9605 (Human/Shigga/1957, Vaccine strain) 63661 (Human/Malavei/1963) W3399 (P. entellus/Hessare/1958) 64244 (Ixodes petauristae/Balagodu/1964) 66364 (Human/Sagar/1966) P20924 (Human/Mullukere/1959) 671004 (P. entellus/Bhadrapura/1967) 7282 (P. entellus/Hollekoppa/1972) W6204 (P. entellus/Kannahalli/1959) W6043 (P. entellus/Belisiri/1959) 72166 (H. kyasanurensis/Gadgeri/1972) 63696 (P. entellus/Suranagadde/1963) G27667 (H. spinigera on dead monkey/Kunvallhai/1959) 642046 (H. p. kinneari/Kangodu/1964) 66928 (Human/Sagar/1966) 1.00 1969 0.86 1977 0.96 1956 1.00 1958 1.00 1942 1.00 1992 Figure 2. Bayesian coalescent analysis of sequence differences of Kyasanur Forest disease virus isolates from India (1957–2006), People’s Republic of China (1989), and Saudi Arabia (1995–2004).

A more complete picture should emerge with analysis of additional virus samples (particularly from the post-1973 period) and complete virus genomes. Bayesian analysis estimates that the 1995 and 2004 KFDV isolates from Saudi Arabia shared a common an- cestor in 1992. The node connecting these viruses with the 2006 KFDV isolate from India was in 1977, and a strongly supported node (1.0) shows that the 1972 and 2006 KFDV isolates from India shared a common ancestor with the viruses from Saudi Arabia in ≈1969. The simplest inter- pretation of these data and the epidemiologic observations would be that KFDV was introduced from India into Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s or the 1980s. Similar findings of low genetic diversity and recent common ancestry were reported for the KFDVs from Saudi Arabia in a more limited study of 11 virus isolates collected over a 5-year period (1994–1999). Only 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.9% genetic diversity were found in the E, NS3, and NS5 gene fragments of these isolates, respectively (27). Using these gene fragments along with those of the complete ge- nome sequence of KFDV from India, the authors estimated divergence time by using an older method based on dis- tance analysis of nonsynonymous substitutions. This esti- mate indicated recent ancestry of these viruses. The KFDV strains from Saudi Arabia were estimated to have diverged from one another over a 4–72 year period and the KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia were estimated to have di- verged 66–177 years ago (27). It is unclear what factors influenced the apparent emer- gence of KFDV in Shimoga District, India, in 1957 and in the Makkah/Jeddah region in Saudi Arabia in 1994. Also unknown is how this tick-borne virus moved over the large distance between these regions. A considerable amount of knowledge has been accumulated with regard to the ecol- ogy of KFDV in India (32). The natural history of the virus is complex and involves dynamic cycles of various life stages of Ixodid ticks (primarily H. spinigera, but also other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks and Ixodes ticks) and am- plifying (vertebrate) hosts, including rodents and shrews, and possibly monkeys and cattle. Increased human popula- tions in the Sagar and Sorab taluks in the early 1950s may have been the primary catalyst for emergence of KFD in 1957. During 1951–1961, the population of Sagar Taluk increased 116%, bringing with it increases in deforestation, cattle grazing, and extension of paddy fields and cleared grazing areas deeper into previously forested areas (32). Expansion of the cattle population may have been a cru- cial factor because cattle harbor adult forms of H. spinigera ticks, and an association between cattle and increases in tick larval density has been described (32). Cattle also carry all life stages of other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, which have been shown to be infected with KFDV. Thus, cattle would likely increase tick densities in cleared forest areas most frequented by humans. In addition, rats, shrews, and mice are highly susceptible to KFDV infection, and numerous virus isolates have been obtained from organs of infected animals (33). Changes in land use and population densities may have resulted in emergence of KFDV from a cryptic enzootic cycle in this previously heavily forested area. A high percentage of birds in the affected area are pos- itive for antibodies reactive with KFDV and infested with Haemaphysalis spp. and other tick genera, particularly lar- vae and nymphs (32). It is unclear whether birds play a role in the complex virus maintenance cycle in an enzootic zone, but birds carrying virus-infected ticks or migration of viremic birds could spread KFDV over large distances such as those separating areas of KFDV activity in India and Saudi Arabia (19,34). There is serologic evidence of KFDV, or a related flavivirus in the mammalian tick-borne virus group, in Saurashtra, Gujarat State, on the coast of India on the Arabian Sea and in birds captured outside Kar- nataka State (2,10,32). The current known distribution of KFDV is limited to relatively restricted areas of India and Saudi Arabia. However, it is likely that the virus exists in other areas in cryptic enzootic cycles or is associated with unrecog- nized or undiagnosed disease. This finding, together with the distance separating the KFDV-affected areas in India and Saudi Arabia, despite their relatively recent common ancestry, suggests that KFD has the potential to flare up in other regions because of virus movement or ecologic changes in the area. Clinicians should consider KFD in a differential diagnosis when considering acute febrile cases with compatible symptoms in other regions of Asia and the Middle East.

In general, specialists are more prone to extinction than generalists and, thus, are often the first species to be lost when habitats are modified. The two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) are arboreal herbivores distributed across the Neotropics. The two-toed sloth is considered a generalist while the three-toed sloth is more specialized. Both species inhabit shade-grown agro-ecosystems but, at least at one study site, only the two-toed sloth was viable. To quantify specialization in sloth species and explore how it influences population viability, we characterized the resource use for 68 adult and 12 subadult sloths across 3 y. The two-toed sloth used 14 tree species relatively uniformly across habitats, while the three-toed sloth largely depended on only two species of tree regardless of habitat type. Both species selected for patches of intact tropical forest, strongly avoided monocultures regardless of spatial scale and generally used cocoa similarly in proportion to availability. However, the sloth species differed in their use of cattle pastures, with the two-toed sloth selecting for pastures and the three-toed sloth avoiding them. Overall, the two-toed sloth exhibited greater plasticity in tree and habitat use, which is likely contributing to its enhanced resilience within this modified agro-ecosystem. Key Words: Costa Rica, farm, Neotropics, Xenarthra INTRODUCTION Resource use and overlap plays a central role in the structuring of vertebrate communities. The mechanisms by which organisms partition resources typically involve differentiation in some combination of habitat use (at both fine and coarse scales), timing of activity and diet. Differences in niche-breadth among competing species are ultimately the result of an evolutionary trade-off between the ability to exploit a wide base of resources and the efficient use of each one (Futuyma & Moreno 1988, MacArthur 1972). Although species occur along a continuum of niche breadth, they are often considered simply as specialists or generalists (Clavel et al. 2010, Julliard et al. 2006). These two resource acquisition strategies have been associated with important life- 1 Corresponding author. Email: jnpauli@wisc.edu history traits: in general, specialists have lower dispersal capacities (Brouat et al. 2004), and are more susceptible to stochasticity and environmental change (Clavel et al. 2010, Sol et al. 2002) than generalists. As a consequence, resource specialists are typically more prone to extinction than generalists, and often the first species to be lost when habitats are modified (Boyles & Storm 2007, Dunn et al. 2009, Laurance 1991). Sloths are mid-sized (2.0–4.5 kg) arboreal mammals that spend the majority of their time in forest canopies. The two phylogenetic groups of sloth, two- (Choloepus spp.) and three-toed sloths (Bradypus spp.), diverged roughly 18–40 Mya (Delsuc et al. 2001, Gaudin 2004), co- occur across much of their distributional range and are ecologically quite different (Pauli et al. 2014). Although both are arboreal folivores, previous authors have broadly described the two-toed sloth as a generalist, inhabiting a range of habitat types and consuming leaves from a number of species as well as augmenting their diet with https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

MENDOZA ET AL. non-leaf items (e.g. fruits, flowers and animal matter) and possessing large home ranges; the three-toed sloth is considered more specialized, foraging on only leaves from a small number of tree species to the point that individuals appear capable of surviving on a single or a few tree species (Chiarello 2008, Gilmore et al. 2001, Montgomery & Sunquist 1975, 1978; Pauli et al. 2014). Both two- and three-toed sloths use shade-grown agro-ecosystems (Vaughan et al. 2007) but in one well-studied system, only the two-toed sloth appears capable of maintaining self-sustaining populations in such habitats, while the three-toed sloth is only viable in the face of immigration from surrounding areas (Peery & Pauli 2014). Herein, we determined resource use and overlap for syntopic populations of two- (C. hoffmanni) and three- toed sloth (B. variegatus) in the same shade-grown agro-ecosystem where viability analyses were conducted (Peery & Pauli 2014) to explore whether greater habitat and resource specialization by the three-toed sloth could be contributing to its relatively low viability in this altered landscape (Peery & Pauli 2014). Specifically, we quantified tree use and macro-habitat selection for both two- and three-toed sloths across a range of different habitats present within the agro-ecosystem. We predicted that diversity of tree species used would be greatest in tropical forests, intermediate in shade-grown cocoa, and lowest in pasture for both species and that the three-toed sloth would exhibit stronger selection for patches of intact forest and greater avoidance of cattle pastures than the two-toed sloth. METHODS Study area Fieldwork was conducted in and around a privately owned organic shade-grown cocoa (Theobroma cacao) farm, in north-eastern Costa Rica (10.32°N, 83.59°W; Figure 1). The region possesses a wet and warm climate featuring a rainy season from mid- or late-April to January, which is briefly interrupted by a dry period in August or September (Holdridge 1967, Janzen 1983). The study area occurs within an agricultural landscape that contains five habitat types: (1) cocoa trees grown under overstorey of native and non-native trees, (2) tropical forest occurring in narrow (�20 m) riparian buffers and small patches, (3) cattle pastures with scattered trees, (4) monocultures of cultivated crops, and (5) human development (i.e. housing) that border the study area. We used 2013 RapidEye satellite imagery (IntraSearch Inc.) with 5-m resolution and five-band multispectral imagery to visually digitize polygons representing these habitat types using ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Animal captures For this study we captured adult two-toed (n = 36) and three-toed sloths (n = 32), and subadult sloths (n = 4; n = 8, respectively) by hand from trees from February 2010 to January 2013. Captured individuals were classified as subadults or adults based on body mass described by Peery & Pauli (2014). Each individual was marked with uniquely coded PIT tags (Biomark, Boise, ID) inserted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades. Additionally, adult males of adequate size were fitted with radio-collars (Mod-210, Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA) to track their movement, and adult females were fitted with uniquely identifiable colour collars. All sloths were relocated every 1–10 d (with a minimum of 24 h between relocations) and the majority (98%) of all sloth relocations occurred during daylight hours. Tree use We classified tree use based on the tree species occupied by an individual at the time of relocation and proportion of species used was calculated for each sloth. Tree species were identified with aid of Zuchowski (2007) and following the nomenclature of Hammel et al. (2003). We used a likelihood ratio test for goodness-of-fit to compare tree use between the two sloth species. Using these data, we also characterized the diversity of tree species used by each individual and by all individuals pooled for each species with Simpson’s index of diversity. Habitat selection We characterized second- and third-order habitat selection to identify habitat characteristics preferred by the two- and the three-toed sloth (Johnson 1980). Second- order habitat selection reflects the habitat features that individuals use to select the location of their home range, whereas third-order selection reflects the habitat features that individuals preferentially use within their home range. For this analysis, we only included individuals that had a minimum of 16 relocations and that were not dispersing from their home range. We estimated home ranges using 90% fixed kernel methods for 34 adult resident two-toed sloths (median = 64 relocations; range: 16–179) and 33 (n = 30 adults; n = 3 subadults) three-toed sloths (median = 50 relocations; range = 20– 212). Home ranges were delineated using ESRI’s ArcGIS 10.1 and the Geospatial Modelling Environment with least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) as the smoothing parameter (Millspaugh & Marzluff 2001). To evaluate second-order habitat selection, we considered used habitat as the proportion of each habitat type in each https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

We treated available habitat as the proportion of each habitat type within the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) of all sloths relocations of a given species (i.e. pooled across individuals). Within the MCP, we calculated available habitat in two different ways: (1) as the proportion of all five habitats (cocoa, tropical forest, pastures, monocultures and human development) and (2) excluding the least-used habitats (monocultures and human development). Monocultures and human development habitats were excluded from the second analysis as sloths are predominantly observed in cocoa, tropical forest and cattle pastures, and rarely utilize monocultures or human development (Vaughan et al. 2007). To test for third-order habitat selection, we considered used habitat to be the proportion of relocations that occurred in each habitat.

We used Manly’s Alpha preference index to test for habitat selection at both levels across all individuals (Manly et al. 2002). We inferred selection for a particular habitat type if the observed index exceeded the expected value and did not overlap in the 95% CI. Conversely, we inferred that sloths avoided a habitat type if the observed index was less than the expected values and did not overlap in the 95% CI. RESULTS Tree use The three-toed sloth heavily utilized only two species – Cecropia obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa – while the two- toed sloth frequented Inga vera slightly more than the other 14 tree species (Figure 2a, b). The difference in tree use was significantly different between the two species Table 1.

Tree-species use differed by habitat type for the three most commonly used habitats (forest, cocoa and pasture) in both three- toed sloth (χ2 = 515, df = 18, P < 0.001) and two-toed sloth (χ2 = 714, df = 28, P < 0.001). The two-toed sloth utilized a greater diversity of trees than the three-toed sloth at both the individual- (t78 = 2.98, P = 0.004) and population-level (Table 1). The diversity of trees used by the two-toed sloth was also higher within cocoa compared with the three-toed sloth at the individual (t78 = 5.65, P < 0.001), and population level (Table 1). Habitat selection The most abundant habitat types within our study area were cocoa, pastures and monocultures, while tropical forest and human development were the least abundant (Table 2). Median home range size was 7.5 ha (range = 0.6–101.1 ha) and 5.3 ha (range = 0.1–53.3 ha) for the two- and the three-toed sloth, respectively. Both species of sloth exhibited second-order habitat selection for tropical forests and avoided monocultures and human development (Figure 3a). However, the two- toed sloth also selected pastures, while the three-toed sloth avoided this habitat type. When we excluded rarely used monocultures and human development from our analyses, the two-toed sloth selected for tropical forest but avoided cocoa; the three-toed sloth selected for tropical forest, and avoided both cocoa and pastures (Figure 3b). Within home ranges (i.e. third-order habitat selection) both the two- and the three-toed sloth selected for tropical forest (Figure 3c), while the three-toed sloth avoided cocoa and strongly avoided pastures (Figure 3c). DISCUSSION As predicted, the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity of tree species and was more plastic in its use of habitats at multiple spatial scales. In contrast, the three- toed sloth exhibited a strong dependence on intact tropical forest and on only two species of tree (Cecropia https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Interestingly, these two tree species were the least used by the two-toed sloth, perhaps a strategy used to avoid interspecific competition. Differences in tree use for the two sloth species appear to depend on the ability of each species to adapt to human modifications; for example, the two-toed sloth generally used the non-native species Erythrina poeppigiana in pastures, while we did not observe any three-toed sloths using this tree species. Overall, the diversity of tree use was somewhat dependent on habitat type, and was similar for both sloth species in riparian forests and pastures, which could be due to the differential availability of trees in the two habitats. On one hand, the richness of trees within intact tropical rain forests is highest and sloths of both species have access to a great number of different tree species. On the other hand, the paucity of tree species within pastures limits the diversity of tree use for both species of sloth. In the habitat where we observed a difference in the diversity of tree use – shade-grown cocoa – the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity of trees compared with the three-toed sloth. This difference is likely due to limited availability of trees preferred by three-toed sloths, especially the scarcity of secondary trees like Nectandra salicifolia and Ocotea sinuata, leading to particularly strong dependence on Cecropia obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa in shade-grown cocoa (pers. obs). Both species of sloth selected intact tropical forests, exhibited neutrality or slight avoidance of shade- grown cocoa, and strongly avoided monocultures and human development. These findings are not particularly surprising, as previous researchers have shown that sloths are largely intolerant of monocultures, and select for habitats with structural complexity and intact forest canopies (Rolim & Chiarello 2004, Vaughan et al. 2007). The neutrality or avoidance (depending on scale and how rarely used habitats were treated) towards shade-grown cocoa was expected for the three-toed sloth but not for the two-toed sloth, especially since the two-toed sloth is frequently observed in cocoa. Vaughan et al. (2007) suggested that the three-toed sloth uses shade-grown cocoa in proportion to its availability whereas the two- toed sloth uses it less than expected. A factor that may explain differences of our results from previous studies is that Vaughan et al. (2007), quantified living fences (in and around the shade-grown cocoa) as a discrete habitat type, and found sloths selected strongly for the fencerows and avoided the cocoa. We choose to pool cocoa and living fences into a more generalized shade-grown cover type to minimize potential GPS and remote sensing error, especially since living fences are extraordinarily narrow (i.e. 1–5 m), and because we believe that fencerows are an implicit and important component of shade-grown cocoa (Chacón & Harvey 2006). The two-toed sloth used pastures in proportion to availability within their home range, while the three-toed sloth avoided this habitat; we presume that the three-toed sloth avoids pastures due to the lack of closed canopies and a dearth of suitable tree species. Additionally, the three-toed sloth may avoid pastures to evade the risk of predation by coyote (Canis latrans) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), as this species is more vulnerable to ground predators given its smaller size and more docile behaviour (Peery & Pauli 2014). In contrast, the two-toed sloth may be better adapted to pastures since it possesses greater mobility and is able to move on the ground in between trees (Sunquist & Montgomery 1973). Overall, our findings suggest that the two-toed sloth is flexible in its use of trees and habitat selection compared with the more specialized three-toed sloth. This greater plasticity in two-toed sloth resource use is likely contributing to its enhanced viability within an agro-ecosystem containing shade-grown elements. Conversely, specialization on a few tree species and avoidance of pastures containing isolated trees seems likely to have contributed to the three-toed sloth’s reduced viability in an agro-ecosystem containing only a fraction of the original forest. More broadly, our results indicate that some generalists are more resilient to the conversion of tropical forests to shade-grown agricultural systems than specialists, even in closely related species. Thus, while shade-grown systems, such as those of cocoa or coffee (Coffea spp.), can harbour a greater diversity of animal species across a range of taxa compared with monocultures (Cassano et al. 2011, Clough et al. 2011, Delabie et al. 2007), by themselves they may be insufficient to harbour some resource specialists. Previous studies have shown that the amount of biodiversity retained in shade-grown agro- ecosystems is positively related to tree density, species composition and diversity (Clough et al. 2011, Schroth https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

MENDOZA ET AL. Figure 3. Manly’s alpha preference index (± 95% CI) for the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) and the two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) at second-order habitat selection including all habitats at our study area in north-eastern Costa Rica from 2010–2013 (a; expected value = 0.20) and excluding monocultures and human development (b; expected value = 0.33). Third-order selection of locations within home ranges of the three-toed sloth and the two-toed sloth (expected value = 0.33). Values above the expected value (horizontal dotted line) indicate preference; values below indicate avoidance. et al. 2004); we suspect that retaining as much of these elements as possible could be particularly beneficial for resource specialists. Moreover, landscape context is likely critical for maintaining sensitive species (Pardini et al. 2009), where the juxtaposition of intact forest to provide a source of immigrants is required to maintaining the full array of species. Our study area, comprised of intact forest, pastures, shade-grown agriculture and monocultures, seems to be a microcosm for much of Costa Rica and Central America (Brown & Lugo 1990, Janzen 1983, Myers 1991, Sader & Joyce 1988) and may provide insight into how different forms of human altered landscapes may favour certain species over others.

The prevalence of antibodies of three arboviruses actively circulating in Thailand was determined by Plaque Reduction Neutralization assay procedures using samples from captive colonies in Northern Thailand. Out of 38 macaques, 9 (24%) presented reacting antibodies against dengue virus, 5 (13%) against Japanese encephalitis virus, and 4 (10%) against Chikungunya virus. Our results indicate that the northern pig‐tailedmacaque in Thailand can be infected by these arboviruses, inferring therefore that their virus specific vectors have bitten them. Given that, northern pig‐tailed macaque represents an abundant population, living in close range to human or in peridomestic setting, they could play a role as potential reservoir host for arboviruses circulating in Thailand.

Key words: dengue virus; Japanese encephalitis virus; chikungunya virus; Macaca nemestrina INTRODUCTION Arboviruses are taxonomically diverse viruses mainly belonging to the togaviridae, flaviviridae, bunyaviridae, rhabdoviridae, reoviridae, and irido- viridae families. By definition, ARthropod BOrne viruses, have a transmission cycle, which always involves a hematophagous arthropod vector, includ- ing mosquitoes or ticks among others. Vectors can replicate and transmit the virus from one vertebrate host to another.Wild and domestic animals can act as intermediate reservoirs or amplificatory hosts of arboviruses potentially pathogenic to humans and transmitted by hematophagous vector feeding on animals as well on humans [Meltzer, 2012]. Human pathogenic arboviruses are of zoonotic origin includ- ing a vertebrate host and a competent anthropophilic vector to transmit the virus. Also, while arboviruses have a sylvatic life cycle including vertebrate animal and intra‐species virus transmission by hematopha- gous vectors, humans can accidentally intrude upon such life cycle by being bitten by vectors with no or limited host trophic preferences [Tananchai et al., 2012; Turell, 2012]. Ultimately, arboviruses may move from a sylvatic cycle, to a human–mosquito– human domestic endemo‐epidemic cycle, as has been described for the dengue virus (DENV) [Gubler, 1998]. Altogether, vectors and vertebrates sustain arbovirus survival in nature with respect to the vector blood feeding habit and its trophic preference for natural vertebrate hosts as well as human and non‐human primates. DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are essentially mosquito‐transmitted arbovirus. DENV is transmitted by mosquito bites of Aedes aegypti and Ae. Albopictus, and has become one of the most significant human–mosquito–human Khajornpong Nakgoi, Narong Nitatpattana, and Worawidh Wajjwalku equally participated in the project. �Correspondence to: Jean‐Paul Gonzalez, Metabiota Inc., 1410 Q St., NW, #300 Washington, DC 20009.

American Journal of Primatology 76:97–102 (2014) © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. transmitted viral diseases with a constant global expansion [Bhatt et al., 2013]. Several monkey species have also been found naturally infected by DENV [Inoue et al., 2003]. Although, chimpanzees can be experimentally infected by DENV, they develop a significant viremia but do not show any clinical symptoms [Scherer et al., 1978]. Also other monkey species, including the African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) and the Guinea baboon (Papio papio), are known to be infected by DENV in the wild [Vasilakis et al., 2011]. Nevertheless, the potential roles of such virus hosts, in the maintenance of the virus in nature, remains poorly understood [Kading et al., 2013]. JEV appears also to be widely distributed across Asia, leading to severe human encephalitis, with a population at risk of more than 2.4 billion [Campbell et al., 2011]. Viral transmission to humans occurs through mosquito bites from Culex spp. [Burke & Leake, 1988; Halstead & Jacobson, 2008; Nitatpat- tana et al., 2005]. Wild birds and domestic pigs appear to be a major host amplifier of JEV [Halstead & Jacobson, 2008; Ompusunggu et al., 2008; Oya, 1967]. CHIKV is transmitted by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus [Jupp and McIntosh, 1988]. CHIKV epidemics appear to spill over from existing sylvatic cycles within none‐immune population of mammal hosts including primates, sheep, rodents, bats, as well as birds [Chevillon et al., 2008]. Also, in Thailand, CHIKV outbreak recurrences are unpre- dictable and can last up to 15 years [Thaikruea et al., 1997]. As described in Malaysia, CHIKV appears to have a sylvatic life cycle including Macaque (Macaca fascicularis) as natural host [Apandi et al., 2010]. The goal of the present study was to determine the presence of specific reacting antibodies against these three mosquito‐borne viruses, among speci- mens of one of the most abundant monkey popula- tions of the northern pig‐tailed macaque, Macaca nemestrina leonine, found in northern region of Thailand [Fooden, 1975]. Captive native northern pig‐tailed macaques tested positive for virus‐specific reacting antibodies using plaque reduction neutrali- zation test (PRNT). METHODS Trapping and sampling: from 2008 to 2009, 38 northern pig‐tailed macaques have been sampled within three of the foremost northern provinces of Thailand including, ChiangMai (18.878 N; 99.218 S), Chiang Rai (19.750 N; 99.6889 E), andMaeHong Son (19.3619N; 97.968E; Fig. 1).Monkeyswere housed in cages placed in an open‐air area. Monkeys were anesthetized using blowpipe‐fired darts, from a distance of 1–3m with darts loaded with 3–5mg/kg of Ketamine Hydrochloride. A 3–5ml venous blood sample was drawn and kept in a cooler at 4°C until they reached the laboratory to be centrifuged. Sera Fig. 1. a: Location fo the three foremost northern Provinces of Thailand.

Primatol. 98 / Nakgoi et al. were then decanted, and aliquots deep‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were tested by PRNT at the Centers for Vaccine Development Institute of Molec- ular Bioscience, Mahidol University at Salaya (WHO Reference Center Laboratory for Diagnosis Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis virus). All procedures including monkey capture and release, anesthesia and venipuncture, complied with legal requirements set forth National Research Council of Thailand and also conformed to all local state, and national laws regulating research on Non Human Primates. In addition, the entire study was conducted under the authorization of the Depart- ment of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conser- vation (# 0909.6/14104), all protocols were approved by Kasetsart University’s Ethical Committee (ACKU02453) and research adhered to the American Society of Primatologists principles for the ethical treatment of primates. Antibody detection: the PRNT method used in the present study for antibody detection has been adapted from the original method described else- where [Morens et al., 1985; Russell et al., 1967]. The virus strains used in the assay were of the four DENV serotype including D1 (16007), D2 (16681), D3 (16562), D4 (1036) parent strains, JEVBeijing strain, and CHIKV African strain, 08/364 [Chen et al., 2010; Monath et al., 2000; Thavara et al., 2009; Yoksan et al., 2009]. LLC‐MK2 cells were used for virus production and PRNT as previously described [Yok- san et al., 2009]. LLC‐MK2 cells were seeded in 6‐well plates at 1� 105 cells/well, and incubated for 5–7 days before use with confluent cell layer. Neutraliz- ing sera were diluted 1:5, followed by 10‐fold serial dilutions using PBS pH 7.5 with 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS), mixed with virus (starting dilution 1:10) and incubated for 7 days. Following infection, cells were overlaidwith 3.0% carboxymethyl cellulose with added neutral red and the visualized plaques were then counted. Data were interpreted using the Probit model with the SPSS® program, PRNT end point titers were expressed as the reciprocal value of the last serum dilution. Titer was calculated based on a 50% reduction in plaque counts, that is, PRNT50 [Yoksan et al., 2009]. RESULTS The three foremost northern provinces of Thailand Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, and Maehong- sorn, were chosen for the active circulation of four DENV serotypes, JEV, and CHIKV, all three provinces reporting annually severe human cases of Dengue hemorrhagic fever, Japanese encephalitis and occasionally Chikungunya fever (Table I) [Anon- ymous, 2008, 2009; Mogi et al., 1988; Nitatpattana et al., 2008; Rianthavorn et al., 2010; Thavara et al., 2009]. All 38 monkeys from the three provinces were identified as Macaca nemestrina leonine. Positive samples were found among specimens of all three provinces (Fig. 1) showing a global seropositive percentage of 23.7, 13.2, and 10.5 against DENV, JEV, and CHIKV, respectively (Table II).

Arbovirus and Macaque, Thailand / 99 DISCUSSION PRNT is the “gold standard” in arbovirus serology, and is actually one of the most specific serological tests for Flavivirus and Alphavirus available to confirm the etiological viral origin of an infection [Ayu et al., 2010; Fagbami et al., 1977; Russell et al., 1967; Tiwari et al., 2009; Wolfe et al., 2001]. This study has provided strong serologic evidence for the spontaneous infection of captive, open‐air housed, northern pig‐tailed macaque by DENV and JEV, and to a lesser extent, by CHIKV in Northern Thailand. Macaques in South East Asia are among themost abundant primates find in both wild and domestic habits. In Thailand, several species proliferate from north to south including:Macaca nemestrina leonine, M. assamensi, M. mulatta (northern species); M. fascicularis, M. arctoides (north and southern spe- cies); M. nemestrina nemestrina (southern species). Northern pig‐tailed macaques (M. nemestrina leo- nine) are abundant in Southeast Asia and inThailand were they are widely found from the South Kra Isthmus to the foremost northern provinces of the country [Malaivijitnond et al., 2012]. Most of the reports on dengue neutralizing antibodies, in monkeys in Southeast Asian countries are fromwild caught specimens showing in particular that half of the macaque population can be lifetime gradually exposed to DENV and JEV [Ayu et al., 2010]. Although, macaques can be easily infected by DENV, they do not present any signs of illness and are considered as asymptomatically infected [de Silva et al., 1999]. Moreover, as previously reported in Manila,Macaca fascicularis can be naturally infected by DENV, JEV, and CHIKV with a consistent antibody prevalence rate of 3.7%, 35.2%, and 14.8%, respectively [Inoue et al., 2003]. In the present study, monkeys weremaintained in cages in an open‐ air space and were naturally exposed to mosquitoes and other hematophagous arthropods. It is known that there is no transmission of DEN, JE or CHIK viruses from vertebrate to vertebrate hosts, only competent arthropod vectors (i.e., mos- quitoes) can transmit the virus to a vertebrate after blood feeding on an infected host and a period of intrinsic replication of the virus in the mosquito salivary gland [Kuno and Chang, 2005]. DENV infection in monkeys occurs from infected Aedes ssp. bites [Rodhain, 1991]. Moreover, Ae. aegypti and Ae albopictus are the major vectors of DENV and CHIKV in Thailand, and efficiently bite and transmit both viruses to Macaca spp. [Turell et al., 1992]. Culex quinquefasciatus, one of the main vectors of JEV in Thailand, is known to feed on primates including human and non‐human primates [Nitatpattana et al., 2005]. Although, Cx. gelidus represent a potential vectors for the CHIKV, Ae. albopictus appears to be the widely spread main vector of CHIKV in Thailand [Kanamitsu et al., 1979; Thavara et al., 2009]. Ultimately, the main vectors of the three studied arboviruses are present in Thailand and can potentially bite and infect the northern pig‐ tailed macaque and therefore replicate and transmit the viruses to such culicids vectors that bite human and other primates. Moreover, macaques are com- mensal species in Thailand, often in close contact to humans. While the main and present vectors of DENV, JEV, and CHIKV can bite human and others primates, northern pig‐tailed macaque is a potential natural host for arbovirus transmission to humans, while reciprocity cannot be excluded as is known already for several other viruses [Kuno and Chang, 2005; Wolfe et al., 2001]. Also, the Southern limit of the northern pig‐tailed macaque of Thailand extends to the southern Kra isthmus, where the distribution of the southern pig‐tailed macaque (Macaca sinica) begins and alsowhereDEN, JE andCHIKviruses are circulating. Human cases of DENV and JEV infection are annually reported in Thailand while cases of CHIKV infection appear to be scarce and epidemic (Table I). Also encephalitis infection is common among the human population in Chiang Rai Province, 2.94 cases/100,000 inhabitants of encephalitis were re- ported from 2008 to 2009, while 15% of them were confirmed as JEV infection [Anonymous, 2008]. CHIKV appears to infect monkeys of the three study sites. CHIKV is known to be endemic and maintained at a low level in Thailand. Uneven sporadic and unexpected cases occur, mostly in urban areas, andCHIKV subsequently disappears for a long periods of time. Despite the limited number of CHIK positive monkeys, samples were collected before and after CHIK activity in humans (2009) in the northern provinces of Thailand (Table I) showing thatmonkeys could be infected independently of human cases and eventually represent the hidden source of CHIKV re‐ emergence [Pialoux et al., 2007; Thavara et al., 2009]. In conclusion, northern pig‐tailed macaques, of the foremost Northern provinces of Thailand, appear to be permissive to infection by DENV, JEV, and CHIKV, undoubtedly through bites of infected mosquitoes. Also arbovirus transmission is known to be temperature dependent, and the three provinces present a marked “cold season” that interrupts virus transmission due to vector diapause. In order for the virus to persist during the overwintering period of the vectors and for the virus to survive in nature, vectors (i.e., transovarial transmission) and natural hosts (i. e., northern pig‐tailed macaque) must play a central role. Ultimately, the high population density of wild and commensal macaque in Thailand, could play an important role as the host of a secondary cycle (i.e., monkey–mosquito–human) involving mosquitoes with an extended trophic preference among primates, such as observed for monkies and arboviruses in Am. J. Primatol. 100 / Nakgoi et al. Africa [Fagbami et al., 1977; Tomori, 2004; Vasilakis et al., 2011]. Wild primates, as a potential natural host and/or reservoir of arbovirus, need to be investigated further in order to understand arbovirus persistence in nature and its epidemic reemergence.

Antibody prevalence to WNV was higher (9%) than for the other viruses. Most seropositive birds were adults ($3 yr of age), with 55% of adults testing positive for antibodies to at least one virus. Adults were significantly more likely to have antibodies to WNV than nonadults (P,0.001). Prevalence of SLEV and EEEV antibodies among Crested Caracaras was 3% for each virus, and three adult caracaras had indistinguishable anti-flavivirus antibodies. The susceptibility of Crested Caracaras to adverse effects of WNV, SLEV, or EEEV infection remains unknown; however, we observed that some free-ranging individuals survived infec- tion and successfully fledged young. Knowl- edge of arboviral infection among Florida’s Crested Caracara, which is both state and federally threatened, is valuable considering increasing pressure on this population from rapid and extensive habitat alterations. Key words: Antibody, Crested Caracara, Caracara cheriway, eastern equine encephali- tis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus. Birds are important virus-amplifying hosts for numerous arboviruses (Stamm, 1966), some of which may adversely affect the health of free-ranging birds (McLean and Ubico, 2007). This is a particular concern for state and federally threatened species, such as the Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway, hereafter, caracara; family Falconidae). The caracara is the only caracara species in North America, and a small, isolated population resides in Florida. Numerous arboviruses circulate within the caracara’s Florida range, including West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; both in the family Flavivi- ridae, genus Flavivirus), and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; family Togavi- ridae, Genus Alphavirus) (Day and Stark, 1996; Blackmore et al., 2003). To our knowledge, WNV, SLEV, and EEEV in- fections have not been documented in caracaras. We sampled caracaras in Florida and tested their sera for specific anti-WNV, -SLEV, and -EEEV antibodies to deter- mine antibody prevalence rates and to assess potential age and sex associations with seroprevalence. We sampled caracaras from April 2007 to August 2008. Flighted caracaras were captured via a phai trap (Beebe and Webster, 1964) modified to accommodate carrion as bait; recently fledged birds were caught by hand. Blood (0.2–0.6 ml) was collected from the ulnar vein of each bird, placed into serum separator tubes, and held at ambient temperature for 1–4 hr before transfer to an iced cooler for 1–4 hr. Thereafter, blood was clarified by centrifu- gation (2,250 3 G for 10 min), and sera were stored at 220 C until testing, except when shipped on ice to Colorado State University (Fort Collins, Colorado, USA). Birds were aged based on the coloration of breast feathers; those with breast feathers fully or partially streaked were categorized as ‘‘nonadult’’ (i.e., subadult, juvenile, or fledgling), and birds with fully barred breast feathers were categorized as 817 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use ‘‘adult’’ (Wheeler and Clark, 2003). Non- adult birds were #2 yr old, and adults were $3 yr old (Dwyer, unpubl. data). Sex was determined for each bird through DNA analysis (Avian Biotech Internation- al, Tallahassee, Florida, USA). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), using Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates (Beaty et al., 1995), was used to detect antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and EEEV. Before testing, serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min. Sera were initially tested at a serum dilution of 1:10 in BA-1 medium (M199- Hank’s salts, 1% bovine serum albumin, 350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/ml amphotericin B in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.6). The PRNT challenge dose was approximately 100 plaque-forming units of the following strains: WNV NY99-4132 (originally isolated from crow brain in New York, USA), SLEV TBH-28 (origi- nally isolated from human brain in Tampa, Florida, USA), and EEEV FL93 (original- ly isolated from mosquitoes in Florida). Known anti-WNV and anti-SLEV anti- body-positive chicken sera and anti-EEEV horse serum served as positive controls in the respective neutralization assays. Serum samples with $90% neutraliza- tion at a 1:10 dilution were considered positive for anti-viral antibodies, and positive samples were serially diluted (twofold) to determine reciprocal end- point 90% neutralization (PRNT90) titers. A fourfold or greater titer of either anti- WNV or anti-SLEV antibodies indicated that particular virus as the etiologic agent of infection. Sera from three individuals were positive for antibodies to both SLEV and WNV, but we could not demonstrate a fourfold or greater titer of either WNV or SLEV, so these individuals were consid- ered flavivirus positive. We tested 80 caracaras from 10 counties for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and EEEV. Sampled birds included 58 nonadults (25 juveniles and 33 subadults) and 22 adults, composed of 47 (59%) females and 33 (41%) males. Fisher’s exact test was used to test for differences in antibody preva- lence rates between adults and nonadults. Antibodies to WNV were detected in seven (9%) of the caracaras. Most (55% [12/22]) of the adults were seropositive for at least one arbovirus, whereas 2% (1/58) of nonadults were seropositive (one juve- nile was positive for antibodies to EEEV). Among adults, one (5%) and two individ- uals (9%) were seropositive for EEEV and SLEV, respectively, whereas three adults (14%) had antibodies to flaviviruses that could not be differentiated as either WNV or SLEV (Table 1). One adult had anti- bodies to both SLEV and EEEV. Among adults, 66% (7/11) of females and 46% (5/ 11) of males were positive for antibodies to one or more arboviruses. Serum PRNT90 antibody titers were from 20 to 80, and seropositive caracaras were cap- tured in six counties (Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin; Fig. 1). Adults were significantly more likely to have anti-WNV antibodies than were TABLE 1.

We found no differ- ence in arbovirus seroprevalence by sex in adults (n522, df51, P50.669) or across all ages (n580, df51, P51.000). Similarly, there was no difference in WNV sero- prevalence by sex in adults (n522, df51, P51.000) or across all ages (n580, df51, P51.000). Seven seropositive adults were providing parental care to dependent fledged young when these adults were sampled. We observed feather mites, lice, or both, and superficial abrasions on the faces of some of the birds sampled, but all birds seemed to be in general good health, were flight capable, and were foraging normally when captured. West Nile virus was first detected in Florida in 2001, at which time antibody prevalence among 10 species of free- ranging birds, including passeriforms, columbiforms, and one falconiform (a Red-shouldered Hawk, Buteo lineatus), was 10.5% (n5152) in Jefferson County, Florida, and Lowndes County, Georgia, USA (Godsey et al., 2005). Both SLEV and EEEV were first reported in Florida in 1952; antibody prevalence rates were 1.3% for EEEV and 0.5% for SLEV (n55,295) among free-ranging birds sam- pled from 1965 to 1974 (Bigler and Hoff, 1975; Bigler et al., 1976). Arbovirus seroprevalence rates observed among ca- racaras in south-central Florida in the present study are consistent with these previous studies. West Nile virus has led to unprecedent- ed mortality in native North American FIGURE 1. Locations of Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway) when sampled in Florida from 2007 to 2008, including those that tested positive for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and nonspecific flavivirus (FLAV). Seropositive birds were located in Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin counties. SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 819 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use birds (Marra et al., 2004), whereas fatal EEEV and SLEV infections have been less commonly reported (McLean and Bowen, 1980; Main et al., 1988). Numer- ous raptors, including members of the family Falconidae, are susceptible to WNV infection and disease, although susceptibility varies among species (Joyner et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2007; Nemeth et al., 2009). Serologic surveys of free- ranging raptors in Wisconsin, California, and Pennsylvania in the USA revealed healthy, free-ranging seropositive individ- uals (Stout et al., 2005; Hull et al., 2006; Medica et al., 2007). Raptors are poten- tially exposed to WNV via mosquitoes and oral infection from prey (Nemeth et al., 2006). In our study, caracaras seropositive for WNV, EEEV, SLEV, or a combina- tion, seemed healthy, although individuals that may have died from infection are not accounted for in serologic surveys. Arboviruses are maintained in enzootic cycles between birds and mosquitoes, and exposure of free-ranging animals depends on many factors, including habitat, season, weather, contact rates between vectors and hosts, and host and vector abundance (Stamm, 1966; Day, 2005). Caracaras in Florida primarily inhabit drained grass- land and pasture habitats that are usually adjacent to drainage ditches, where mos- quitoes often are abundant (Morrison and Humphrey, 2001; Diuk-Wasser et al., 2006). Breeding caracaras are nonmigra- tory and live in pairs on defended territories throughout the year. Nonbreed- ing caracaras are vagrant throughout south-central Florida and aggregate at communal roosts that may consist of .200 individuals during the wet season (approximately late May to October; Dwyer et al., unpubl. data). Transmission rates are potentially high within commu- nal roosts, as evidenced in American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in east-central Illinois (Yaremych et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2006). However, we found little evidence of arbovirus infection in caracaras #2 yr of age. Limited evidence for WNV infec- tion in younger birds could be partially explained by apparently low levels of WNV transmission in counties within our study area in recent years (http://diseasemaps. usgs.gov/wnv_historical.html). In addition, longer lived resident animals, such as the Crested Caracaras (Morrison, 2003), may be more likely to encounter an infectious mosquito during their lifetime than either shorter lived animals or animals that migrate to regions where mosquito vectors are inactive for part of the year. In the present study, antibodies to arboviruses were more common in adult caracaras than in younger birds, although the timing of initial infection is unknown. This result is consistent with other studies in which antibody prevalence rates of WNV and other arboviruses were higher among free-ranging adult birds than youn- ger individuals (Garvin et al., 2004; Beveroth et al., 2006). Garvin et al. (2004) hypothesized that young Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) may succumb to EEEV infection and therefore may not be represented in seroprevalence studies, and there is evidence that young birds of some species are more susceptible to WNV-associated morbidity and mortality than older birds (Austin et al., 2004; Nemeth and Bowen, 2007; Nemeth et al., 2008). Both adult and juvenile caraca- ras had relatively high estimated annual survival (89.1 and 69.4%, respectively) before the arrival of WNV to Florida (1994–2000; Morrison, 2003); however, whether infection with WNV or other arboviruses affects survival of this species remains unknown. We demonstrated that some free-rang- ing caracaras survive infection with WNV and other arboviruses with no apparent reductions in fecundity. However, Flor- ida’s population of caracaras faces a variety of challenges, including geographic isola- tion and human-induced alterations of nesting and foraging habitat (Morrison and Humphrey, 2001). Changes in land use may affect caracara behavior, as well as mosquito density and distribution, 820 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 45, NO. 3, JULY 2009 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use potentially leading to increased caracara- vector contact, and therefore more oppor- tunities for arbovirus transmission. Fur- ther studies are warranted to ascertain whether caracaras suffer negative effects from arboviral infection, and particularly WNV.

Both JEV and WNV are naturally transmitted between mos- quito vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts, including birds. A potential route of JEV introduction from Asia to western North America is via the Hawaiian archipelago, while the spread of WNV from mainland North America to Hawai‘i is also considered an impending threat. We surveyed resident, non- native bird sera for antibodies to JEV and WNV on two Hawaiian Islands from 2004–2005. Three of 1,835 birds (0.16%) had evidence of antiflavivirus antibodies, demonstrating neu- tralizing activity to JEV and St. Louis enceph- alitis virus (SLEV). These detections could represent a limited transmission focus of either, or both, JEV and SLEV, or cross-reactive antibodies due to primary infection with an alternate flavivirus. Frequent air traffic from both Asia and North America to Hawai‘i, along with the presence of probable competent vectors and amplifying vertebrate hosts in Hawai‘i, increases the likelihood of introduction and maintenance of novel flaviviruses. There- fore, it is important to monitor for the presence of these viruses. Key words: Bird, Hawai‘i, Japanese en- cephalitis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus. Hawai‘i and other remote islands are particularly vulnerable to the introduction of novel wildlife pathogens because of immunologically naı̈ve vertebrate host populations. Peridomestic mosquitoes were introduced to Hawai‘i with the arrival of European human settlers and, as a result, devastating mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium relictum [avi- an malaria] and Avipoxvirus [avian pox]) decimated native avian populations (La- Pointe, 2007). Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus (JEV and WNV, respectively; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are globally emerging mosqui- to-borne viruses that cause fatal enceph- alitis in humans and other vertebrates and could pose a significant threat to the state of Hawai‘i (Kilpatrick et al., 2004; Mack- enzie et al., 2004). Similar to WNV, JEV is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, with birds as amplifying hosts. It is thought that WNV may have arrived in the United States via an infected mosquito or verte- brate host (Gubler, 2007); similarly, these mechanisms have likely contributed to the geographic spread of JEV (Mackenzie et al., 2004). Because of the risk of introduction of novel arboviruses to Hawai‘i, we screened free-ranging, resident birds for serologic evidence of past infection with several arboviruses within the Japanese encepha- litis serocomplex including JEV, WNV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). Our objective was to determine the serum antibody prevalence of WNV and JEV among birds captured primarily at sites that receive frequent air traffic. We hypothesized that a local transmission focus could initiate if one of these viruses arrived via a viremic human or other vertebrate, or via an infected mosquito associated with air travel. Serologic evi- dence of flavivirus infection among resi- dent birds may be suggestive of local transmission and would help establish baseline antibody prevalence for future research and surveillance efforts. Resident birds were mist-netted year- round from June 2004–December 2005 at various sites on the islands of Oahu 659 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis (Barber’s Point, Dillingham Airfield, Hickam Airfield, Honolulu Airport, Ka- laeloa, and Kewalo; approximately 21uN, 157–158uW) and Maui (Kahului Airport; 20u549N, 156u269W). Blood was collected by venipuncture of the jugular vein (approximately 0.1–0.2 ml) and either left undiluted or diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffered saline with 0.75% bovine serum albumin. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 3 G for 3 min, and sera were aliquotted into separate vials, heat inacti- vated at 56 C for 30 min, and stored at 220 or 280 C. Sera were screened at the Hawai‘i Department of Health Laboratory (HDHL), in Pearl City, Hawai‘i, for anti- WNV antibodies by a blocking enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting an immunodominant WNV epi- tope on the NS1 protein. Prior to estab- lishing the ELISA as part of the WNV testing algorithm at the HDHL in Febru- ary 2005, optimal titers for both antigen and antibody were determined by check- erboard titration. Sera were tested in triplicate at a 1:20 dilution for initial screening, with suspected positives (inhi- bition $50%) also tested at further dilutions (e.g., 1:40 and 1:80). Beginning in February 2005, a blocking ELISA protocol was established according to Hall et al. (1995), using inactivated Kunjin lysate antigen and WNV- specific monoclonal antibodies, with mod- ifications for detection of anti-WNV anti- bodies as described in Jozan et al. (2003). All ELISA positives were considered presumptive until confirmatory testing by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Samples were shipped overnight on ice to Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, where they were screened for anti-JEV antibodies by PRNT (Beaty et al., 1995). For PRNT, sera were tested at a 1:10 dilution in BA-1 medium (Hank’s M- 199 salts, 1% bovine serum albumin, 350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ ml penicillin, 100 mg/l streptomycin, 1 mg/ l Fungizone in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.6) against a challenge dose of approximately 100 plaque-forming units of JEV strain 826309 (isolated from human brain in India). Serum samples that neutralized #70% of JEV were considered negative for anti-JEV antibodies. Samples with .70% neutralization of JEV were retested through a second JEV PRNT for confir- mation of the initial result, and were also screened by PRNT at a 1:10 dilution for antibodies to WNV (using strain NY99- 4132, isolated from crow brain in New York, USA) and SLEV (using strain TBH- 28, isolated from human brain in Florida, USA) with the same criteria of .70% neutralization for a positive result. This 70% neutralization cut-off was selected to reasonably distinguish antiflavivirus anti- body reactivity from clearly seronegative (i.e., ,50% neutralization) samples. A total of 1,835 birds of 11 species were sampled, most of which were nonnative residents of Hawai‘i (Table 1). Serum samples from all birds included in the present study were negative for anti-WNV antibodies as determined by blocking ELISA, along with an additional .10,000 avian serum samples collected in Hawai‘i from January 2006–October 2009. Sera from three birds (0.16%) exhibited flavi- virus neutralizing activity with between 71–94% neutralization of JEV or SLEV. Sera from these three birds were clearly negative for antibodies to WNV by ELISA (,0% inhibition) and by PRNT (,50% neutralization). Sera with JEV- or SLEV- neutralizing activity were collected be- tween June and September 2005 from a Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis) and a Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora) at the Honolulu International Airport and a Spotted Dove at Dillingham Airfield. In two of these birds (Spotted Dove and Java Sparrow), apparent cross-reactive antifla- vivirus antibodies made it difficult to differentiate antibodies specific to JEV versus SLEV (Table 2). Japanese encephalitis virus has been deemed the most important cause of 660 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 46, NO. 2, APRIL 2010 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis epidemic encephalitis worldwide and is the leading recognized cause of childhood encephalitis in Asia (Tsai, 1997; Solomon, 2003). Likewise, WNV is an important cause of arboviral disease in the United States and, since its arrival to New York in 1999, has led to neuro-invasive disease in .11,000 humans and the death of likely millions of birds (Reimann et al., 2008). Because transmission of these viruses involves primarily wild birds and mosqui- toes, as well as pigs for JEV, they are difficult to control and eradicate once established. Therefore, ongoing monitor- ing for these viruses is important, espe- cially in Hawai‘i, where the climate favors year-round arbovirus transmission and, presumably, competent (and naı̈ve) vec- tors and hosts are in abundance. Hawai‘i has been recognized as a potential location for JEV emergence that could facilitate spread from Asia to western North America (Quisenberry and Wallace, 1959). The possibility of intro- duction of SLEV, WNV, JEV, or other zoonotic viruses to Hawai‘i via viremic captive birds or infected mosquitoes is an important consideration in quarantine and other control measures. Accordingly, WNV surveillance has been ongoing in Hawai‘i since November 2004, and em- bargoes and quarantines have been im- plemented to mitigate the threat of WNV introduction (Marra et al., 2004). Quanti- tative analysis suggested that the most likely source for the introduction of WNV to Hawai‘i is a human-transported infected mosquito, or an infectious bird or other vertebrate host (Kilpatrick et al., 2004). Similarly, JEV introduction to the West coast of the United States was deemed most likely to occur via an infected TABLE 1.

While local transmission could initiate following JEV or WNV introduction to Hawai‘i, maintenance or amplification of transmission could subsequently fail due to lack of immediate and sufficient num- bers of competent vectors or hosts. Alternately, flaviviruses that are yet to be detected or identified could occasionally infect birds. For example, ‘‘insect-only’’ flaviviruses have recently been identified in Africa, Asia, and the Americas (re- viewed recently in Cook et al., 2009) and could be immunogenic in some birds. Documented viruses such as Murray Valley encephalitis virus, also a member of the JEV serocomplex that circulates between mosquito vectors and avian hosts in Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Irian Java, may also be capable of unexpected spread (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988). The lack of 100% virus neutralization by sera from flavivirus-positive birds in the present study may suggest a primary infecting virus other than WNV, SLEV, or JEV. We detected a minimal percent- age (,0.2%) of birds with flavivirus- neutralizing antibodies in Hawai‘i from 2004–2005. Low prevalence of antibodies to arboviruses among birds in Hawai‘i, as well as difficulty distinguishing the infec- tive virus, is consistent with previously reported data. In 1959, surveillance for JEV, SLEV, and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses on Oahu revealed five birds (0.66%; n5754), all residents, with evidence of nonspecific virus neutralization (Wallace et al., 1964). In contrast, WNV antibody prevalence among some avian species has been 10– 25% in the southern mainland United States, several years or more after the introduction of WNV (e.g., Louisiana in 2002 [Komar et al., 2005], Georgia in 2004 [Gibbs et al., 2006]). Native Hawaiian birds are potentially vulnerable to disease associated with infection with novel arboviruses (Warner, 1968; Van Riper et al., 1986; LaPointe et al., 2009). However, introduced birds thrive on the Islands, and many of these are likely competent reservoir hosts of WNV and SLEV, such as the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), as well as the native Hawai‘i ‘Amakihi (Hemignathus virens; McLean et al., 1983; Reisen et al., 2001; Komar et al., 2003; LaPointe et al., 2009). Potential JEV reservoirs are also present in Hawai‘i, such as the resident Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax hoactli) and introduced Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), as well as feral swine (Sus scrofa) (Buescher et al., 1959; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004; LaPointe, 2007). In addition, potentially competent mosquito vectors are found in Hawai‘i including Aedes albopictus, Ochlerotatus japonicus, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Reeves and Hammon, 1946; Quisenberry and Wallace, 1959; Joyce, 1961; Larish and Savage, 2005; LaPointe, 2007; La- Pointe et al., 2009). Further, Cx. annulir- ostris and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus have been intercepted on numerous occasions from aircraft arriving in Honolulu (Joyce, 1961). Finally, unlike some birds in the mainland United States in which cross- protective anti-WNV antibodies may in- hibit JEV amplification in blood (Nemeth et al., 2009), Hawaiian birds are likely immunologically naive and, therefore, more susceptible to adverse effects of flavivirus infection. The effects of JEV infection in birds remain unknown. Recent flavivirus dispersal includes WNV spread from the Middle East to the United States and JEV from Southeast Asia to Australia. While the mechanism of spread remains unknown, these invasions signify the perpetual threat of pathogen emergence. In addition to global travel, human movement into previously unin- habited areas and associated changes in 662 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 46, NO. 2, APRIL 2010 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis land and water use may facilitate pathogen emergence and establishment (Mackenzie et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004). While the geographic spread of highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 avian influenza virus is closely monitored on a global scale, JEV and other arboviruses merit worldwide attention as significant zoonotic patho- gens. The possibility of rapid and wide- ranging pathogen spread is greater than ever, and surveillance for novel invasions, especially involving wildlife, may provide an early warning and lead to mitigation of epidemic threats.

Bag 24, Geelong 3220, Australia Accepted 9 March 2006 Abstract A regional survey was conducted in Nepal for antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in domestic animals. Sera from pigs, and limited numbers of ducks and horses were collected from 16 districts in 2002–2003 and subjected to three serological tests.

Additional testing for IgM antibody to JEV revealed less than 2% of C-ELISA positive sera had evidence of recent JEV infection. Plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT) using JEV, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVEV) and Kunjin (KUNV) viruses implicated JEV as the flavivirus associated with the observed antibody response in most sero-positive pigs. However, eight porcine sera with predominant neutralising antibody for KUNV (an Australasian subtype of West Nile Virus) provided evidence for the circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal. q 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Japanese encephalitis is an emerging disease of animals and humans, spread by mosquitoes to a range of susceptible wild and domestic vertebrate hosts [1]. Endemic cycling of the causative Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from mosquitoes to ardeid water birds creates a reservoir for spill-over to other species in times of peak transmission, generally associated with warm month high vector prevalence. At such times, infection of pigs in the vicinity of human habitation correlates with the occurrence of human disease. High viraemic levels in pigs promote infection of mosquito species that can readily transmit the virus to humans [2]. In the southern lowlands of Nepal, irrigated rice fields provide ample mosquito breeding sites in proximity with humans and domestic animals, ensuring favourable conditions for human JEV infection [3]. Japanese encephalitis has been recognised in Nepal since 1978 [4] and has progressed to be now the major cause of seasonal meningo-encephalitic related morbidity and mortality [5,6]. Since 1987 annual outbreaks of human JEV disease, peaking in September, have been reported causing up to 2000–3000 cases and 200–400 deaths per year. More than half the cases and deaths were reported from two districts Kailali and Banke. In the large 1997 outbreak, three western districts Banke, Bardia and Kailali encompassed more than 80% of the 2403 reported cases and in 335 deaths [6]. The virus now occurs in 27 districts of the country, including the Kathmandu valley and an estimated 12 million people are at risk. Although JEV is a recognised cause of disease in pigs and horses, most infections of domestic animals in JEV endemic areas are asymptomatic and human disease imperatives are predominant [2]. In 2001, the Nepal Department of Livestock Services implemented control measure, which recognised the significant role of pigs for human JEV infection by vaccination of 45,213 pigs in held in tarai (lowland border district) zones with live attenuated virus [7]. Approximately, 40% of the Nepal pig population (about 359,000 pigs) is held in these lowland JEV endemic districts. While pigs are critically involved in epizootics of JEV, there have been only limited studies in Nepal, which might assist targeting vaccination programs [3,8]. The lack of diagnostic facilities for JEV at the G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175168 Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Kathmandu was addressed in a collaborative and training project with the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong. In the year 2002–2003, the CVL launched a program to monitor for evidence of JEV infection with this virus in domestic animals. This paper presents an assessment of the laboratory testing undertaken on sera collected from that survey. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Viruses Viruses and antigens used in serologic assays were originated from the following sources: JEV Nakayama strain derived from a 1956 stock held at AAHL; MVEV MRM66 and KUNV MRM16 isolates were both obtained from Public Health Virology, Queensland Health Scientific Services, Australia. 2.2. Sera A total of 270 sera were collected in 2002–2003 from pigs, ducks and horses by visiting various livestock farms of 16 different district (see Fig 1) tarai regions, where high incidence of human infection has previously been recorded [5]. These sera were stored at K20 8C until testing. Testing of sera was conducted at the AAHL and CVL institutes. Fig. 1. Map of Nepal showing districts in which animals were sampled for serology. G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 169 From 270 collected sera, 200 (pig sera only) were heat treated for 30 min at 56 8C before shipment to Australia for testing. On arrival sera were treated by gamma irradiation for 50 kGy to ensure inactivation of potentially exotic agents. The remaining 70 pigs ducks and horse sera were tested at CVL after the establishment of JEV serology capability. 2.3. JEV C-ELISA serology The competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) for detection of antibody to JEV has previously been described [9]. In brief, (a) polyvinyl 96-well plates were coated with JEV antigen, (b) serum was added at 1/10 dilution, (c) monoclonal antibody JEV-995 [10] was added to the serum in ELISA plates, (d) enzyme-antibody conjugate was anti-mouse/horse radish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA), and (e) tetramethyl benzidine (TMB)–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS (pH 7.2)— 0.05% Tween-20 wash steps separated steps (a)–(e). Substrate conversion was stopped by addition of sulphuric acid (1 M), and the plates immediately read in a microplate photometer (Labsystems, Finland) at wavelength 450 nm. Resultant optical densities (OD) were converted to percent inhibition relative to a normal pig serum control. 2.4. JEV IgM ELISA serology The IgM ELISA was a standard antibody capture format modified from other studies [11,12]. In brief, (a) ELISA plates were coated with an anti-swine IgM (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and (b) sera were tested at 1/300 dilution in PBS (pH 7.2), 0.05% Tween-20, 1% skim milk, (c) inactivated JEV antigen, PEG concentrated from infected culture supernatant medium was applied at an optimal dilution (1/200), (d) JEV-989 antibody labelled with fluorescein (used as a hapten, not fluorophor) was bound to trapped antigen. (e) Enzyme- antibody conjugate was anti-fluorescein/horse radish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories Ltd, Peterborough, UK) and (f) TMB–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS-tween wash steps separated steps (a)–(f). Substrate and plate reading were as for the C-ELISA, while OD values were converted to percent positive control. 2.5. Plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) serology PRNT serology was used to test for specific neutralising antibody against JEV. Two related flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses (MVEV and KUNV, respectively), were included together with JEV for all PRNTs. Sera were tested in a PRNT according to standard methodology [13] using 24-well plates. In brief, sera were tested in serial dilution fourfold from 1/40 to 1/1280. Serum dilutions were mixed with an equal volume containing approximately 50 plaque forming units of virus and incubated for 90 min. Two-hundred microliters of the mixture was transferred to 24-well plates with confluent Vero cell monolayers. After 90 min a carboxy-methyl cellulose overlay medium was added. After 4–5 days plates were fixed and stained with formol saline—0.1% methylene blue then counted for plaques. The 50% plaque reduction end-point titres were estimated by linear interpolation between dilutions (log value) and plaque counts to give a continuous scale of results over the dilution series. Some sera with PRNT titres of less than G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175170 40 were retested in a screening test using sera at a 1/10 dilution only. Results were reported as ‘!10’ or ‘10–40’. Sera were generally tested only once unless anomalies were evident on analysis. Internal quality control monitored input virus, positive and negative control sera to ensure inter-assay consistency. 3. Results 3.1. JEV C-ELISA serology Fig. 1 shows areas of Nepal where we obtained the test samples, which were predominantly from pigs. Initial testing of serum samples was carried out by JEV C-ELISA. Antibodies against JEV were detected in 154 of 251 pigs (61%) using the JEV C-ELISA (Table 1). In all districts, there was evidence for infection of animals with JEV. Correlation of results with the geographical origin of the sera from within Nepal demonstrated that highest proportion of antibody positive animals were located in the Far- Western region (89% JEV antibody positive) with the lowest rates in the Central region (39% JEV antibody positive). Additional JEV C-ELISA serology in four horses and 11 ducks showed 50 and 7% sero-positive animals, respectively. 3.2. JEV IgM serology IgM ELISA was performed on 119 C-ELISA positive sera to measure the frequency of recent exposure to JEV. Only two sera (or 1.7%) were positive for IgM antibody to JEV. These sera originated from pigs, respectively, located in Makwanpur (collected in November) and Siraha (collected in May) districts.

Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 171 3.3. PRNT serology PRNT serology was conducted to further assess the significance of the JEV C-ELISA results. Of the 200 pig sera sent to AAHL, almost all were tested by JEV C-ELISA and PRNT for antibody to JEV and related flaviviruses MVEV and KUNV. Ranking by titre, independently for each of the three viruses (Table 2) gave distribution profiles for the tested population. The profile showed greater numbers of sera having the highest antibody levels against JEV as might be expected in an area endemic for this virus. Antibody detected in an animal as a heterotypic response to related viruses will, in the absence of those viruses, generally be evident as a lesser titre to that against the homologous virus. For each PRNT positive serum, calculation of titre ratios (JEV:MVEV and JEV:KUNV) confirmed that JEV PRNT titres were on average five times the level of MVEV PRNT titres and 10 times the KUNV titre values, consistent with a specific JEV antibody response relative to the two related flaviviruses. JEV-C-ELISA and PRNT results were compared in 2!2 pair-wise tables for agreement (Table 3). PRNT results were scored as positive or negative using either JEV PRNT results only, or more broadly using combined JEV/MVEV/KUNV PRNT results. In the latter grouping, a positive in any of the three PRNTs was scored as positive for the purpose of comparison with the JEV C-ELISA. The overall results were similar for the two groupings with about 60–70% agreement between the assay results, and the discrepancies evenly split between the two available options. One effect of broadening the scope for comparison of C-ELISA and PRNT to include MVEV and KUNV was the identification of nine sera, negative by JEV ELISA and JEV PRNT, but positive for antibody against either, or both of the other flaviviruses. These results are detailed as they may provide some insight into additional flaviviruses that circulate in Nepal (Table 4). Also included are results, which, although detected as JEV C-ELISA positive, evidenced greater PRNT titres against either MVEV and/or KUNV, than JEV. From the groups of sera with higher PRNT titre levels (O40), there were two sera for which antibody titres against MVEV were at least four times the corresponding JEV titres, and four sera for which antibody titres against KUNV were four times or Table 2 Range of PRNT titres in 200 porcine sera for tested antibody against JEV, MVEV and KUNV PRNT titre Number of sera with this PRNT result for: JEVa MVEV KUNV Less than 40 86 97 105 40–100 13 15 20 100–500 21 36 22 500–1000 9 13 12 Greater than 1000 55 23 23 Positive in screen test only 15 12 14 Not testedb 1 4 4 Total 200 200 200 a Data are presented as groupings of PRNT results sorted independently for each of the three viruses. b There was insufficient serum volume to complete testing.

G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175172 greater than corresponding JEV titres. An additional two sera could not be grouped definitively with either MVEV or KUNV. Some clustering of sera by district of origin relative to these non-JEV reaction patterns was also noted. In particular, sera collected from the Kapil Bastu district were the majority of the sera positive for antibody to KUNV at a higher level than for JEV. 4. Discussion Previous published studies of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal have addressed issues of diagnosis and emerging prevalence in human populations [5,6] and though the involvement of domestic animals, in particular pigs [3,8], has been recognised as a risk G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 173 factor, there has been no broad surveillance to determine the prevalence of infection in pigs or other susceptible animals. The lowland provinces of Nepal have proven a favourable environment for JEV to become established and emerge as a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Effective control measures must be founded on sound epidemiological investigation. The extent and involvement of pigs and possibly other animals as risk factors for mosquito transmission of the virus to humans is an essential component. This study presents results, which provide evidence that antibody to JEV is in pigs widespread across 16 districts. Though sample numbers are relatively low, the mean seroprevalence of greater than 90% in the Far Western region (Table 1) is evidence for intense circulation of JEV in these animals. It is significant that the highest rates of human JEV disease has been described in the western districts [14], therein correlating with our results of high proportions of JEV antibody positive pigs in these districts. Circulation of JEV is affected by animal management practices and the co-location of pigs and human dwellings is an obvious risk factor for human disease. In Nepal, pigs are generally animals that will be sold for meat after relatively short periods (1–2 years). Annual farrowing, together with removal of immune animals, ensures non-immune pigs will exist each year, heightening the risk for human disease. The absence of IgM antibody to JEV amongst the tested animals is not surprising, when the following factors are taken into account. None of the samples were collected in the months of August/September, when peak transmission of the virus in pigs might be expected, based on human epidemiological patterns of JEV. Furthermore, the duration of detectable IgM in pigs is relatively short [11], averaging only 3 weeks and would not be expected to persist in those months in which samples were collected. A wide range of animal species may be infected and develop antibodies to JEV. It might, therefore, be expected that sera collected from horses and ducks in an endemic region could be seropositive. This was the case for two of four horse sera collected in Parsa district and one duck serum from Banke district (Table 1). These species are not significant in the maintenance cycle of JEV, but this is the first report for involvement of equines in Nepal. In regions in which multiple flaviviruses might potentially cause infections, the determination of a specific flavivirus antibody response can be problematic as the potential influence of related flaviviruses on serological investigations for these viruses is well recognised [15]. In applying a range of serology approaches in this study, we were attempting to evaluate the specificity of the detected immune response against JEV and investigate the likelihood of any recent infection. The JEV C-ELISA has been shown to detect antibody against related flaviviruses (Table 3 and [9]), and while the PRNT is a more specific test, field animals subjected to multiple exposures with a range of flaviviruses have a broadened neutralising antibody response. The titre magnitude and the relative differential of serum titres against different viruses have been used to evaluate the significance of results. For this reason, we included two related flaviviruses MVEV and KUNV) as well as JEV in our PRNT testing for neutralising antibody. On the basis of predominant titre levels, there is good evidence that detected antibody generally represented exposure to JEV (Table 2). G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175174 The interpretation of the serology results must also allow for the possible influence of JEV vaccination as a contributing factor to positive antibody determinations. However, moderating considerations relate to the timing of vaccination, the turnover of animal stock and the neutralising titres observed in the test animals. While the history of vaccination for the tested animals was not available, collection of sera occurred 1–2 years after the 2001 vaccination campaign. Also only a small proportion of pigs were vaccinated and it is unlikely that vaccination would have produced the high neutralising titres frequently seen in the group of JEV seropositive animals in this study. There is little information on the range of flaviviruses that may circulate in Nepal, though JEV and dengue virus are recognised in humans [3]. West Nile virus has been demonstrated in India [16], while the tick-borne flavivirus Kyasanur Forest has also been identified in that country [17]. There were results for some sera in our survey for which an interpretation of JE exposure was not particularly appropriate. Sera were identified that had predominant neutralising activity for either KUNV or MVEV, providing evidence for the circulation of flaviviruses other than JEV. This is particularly the case for sera that were positive for PRNT antibody to KUNV but negative by JEV C-ELISA, e.g. sera 78 and 90 (Table 4). KUNV is now recognised as an Australasian variant of WNV [18,19], and in Nepal, predominant neutralising titres against KUNV is presumptive evidence for WNV circulation [20]. We believe that there have not previously been reports for this virus in Nepal, however, WNV has been isolated from pig sera in India [21]. Prior infection in pigs with JEV may inhibit WNV viraemia [22], which may be a factor in our detection of antibody to WNV only in districts with a relatively low prevalence of JEV. While JEV is considerably more important as a human epizootic virosis than a production animal disease agent, the significance of pigs in the amplification cycle introduces an additional basis for involvement of veterinary authorities in monitoring for this agent. Accurate laboratory based detection and diagnosis is a crucial platform from which to extend control measures [20]. Collaborative work associated with this publication has transferred the capability for JEV diagnosis to the Central Veterinary laboratory in Nepal. Control of the disease will ultimately require effective human vaccination as vaccination of pigs is not considered a useful control measure [23]. However, there is indeed a role for integration between veterinary and public health authorities in determining the epidemiology of infection and prospective surveillance for JEV. Our results indicating the likely circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal are also of value in consideration of the aetiology human disease presenting as febrile or encephalitic syndromes.

Reviews in Medical Virology DOI: 10.1002/rmv.495 Kyasanur forest disease: an epidemiological view in India Priyabrata Pattnaik* Virology Division, Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, India SUMMARY Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India. The causative agent, KFD virus (KFDV), is a highly pathogenic member in the family Flaviviridae, producing a haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings. KFD is a zoonotic disease and has so far been localised only in a southern part of India. The exact cause of its emergence in the mid 1950s is not known. A variant of KFDV, char- acterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been recently identified in Saudi Arabia. KFDV and AHFV share 89% sequence homology, suggesting common ancestral origin. Homology modelling of KFDV envelope (E) protein exhibited a structure similar to those of other flaviviruses, suggesting a common mechanism of virus-cell fusion. The possible mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction involved in infection by KFDV may resemble that of other flavivirses. Present understanding is that KFDV may be persisting silently in several regions of India and that antigenic and structural differences from other tick borne viruses may be related to the unique host specificity and pathogenicity of KFDV. From January 1999 through January 2005, an increasing number of KFD cases have been detected in Karnataka state of Indian subcontinent despite routine vaccination, suggesting insufficient efficacy of the current vaccine protocol. However, the exact cause of the increase of KFD cases needs further investigation. Considering the requirement of safer and more effective vaccines in general, there is clearly a need for developing an alternative vaccine as well as a rapid diagnostic system for KFD. The changing ecology of the prime focus of the KFD also warrants attention, as it may lead to establishment of the disease in newer localities, never reported before.

Received: 10 September 2005; Revised: 6 January 2006; Accepted: 13 January 2006 INTRODUCTION KFDV that causes a haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings is a highly pathogenic member of the family Flaviviridae. KFD was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga dis- trict of Karnataka state (then Mysore) of India in 1957 [1,2]. KFDV commonly infects the black faced langur (Presbytis entellus) and red faced bonnet monkey (Macaca radiate). KFDV is of zoonotic ori- gin and gets transmitted by the bite of infective ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera), especially at its nymphal stage, and the ticks remain infectious throughout their lives. KFDV also circulates in small animals such as rodents, shrews and birds [3]. Adult ticks mostly feed on large animals, as they serve as a good host for tick proliferation, however they do not suffer from the disease. Neutralising antibodies have been found in cattle, buffaloes, goats, wild bears, porcupines, squirrels, rats, mice and a number of avian species (Table 1). Direct transmission of the virus from rodents to humans is possible; however, person-to-person transmission has not been documented. Besides, KFDV is regarded as a potential biowarfare agent [19]. KFDV belongs to the Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus group and the antibodies cross react with other RSSE group members. Although isolated cases of KFD and RSSE have been reported from several parts of India, epi- demics of KFD mostly remain confined in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Epidemics of KFD were controlled to a great extent using a formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in chick embryo fibroblasts [20]. Although KFDV is antige- nically similar to the members in the complex RR EE V II E W Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. *Corresponding author: P.

TBEV (tick born encephalitis virus) group, the exact causes of the sudden emergence of KFDV in India during the late 1950s and the subsequent localisation to Karnataka state alone are not clear. Despite its high pathogenicity and potential epide- miological importance, there have been relatively few detailed antigenic and molecular studies on KFD virus. The only molecular information avail- able is the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the vital structural proteins [21]. According to the internationally accepted bio- safety rules, KFDV is a level-4 virus. KFDV is a spherical, enveloped virus of 45 nm diameter. It has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. The virus is lethal to infant and weaning mice when inoculated through the intracerebral or intraperitoneal route. It is cytopathic and produces plaques in chick embryo, hamster kidney and monkey kidney cell cultures, but replicates with- out cytopathic effect in a continuous line of Haemaphysalis spinigera tick cells [22]. The early clinical signs of KFD in humans involve sudden onset of fever and headache, followed by back pain, severe pain in lower and upper extremi- ties, prostration as well as biphasic course of illness. Subsequently to fever, haemorrhagic mani- festations, including intermittent epistaxis, haema- temesis, melena and frank blood in the stools, are Table 1.

In some cases, central nervous system abnormalities develop after an afebrile period of 1–2 weeks. A mild meningoence- phalitis also occurs frequently amongst a small portion of patients, developing coma or bronchop- neumonia prior to death. IgE has also been impli- cated as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possibly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23]. The exact cause of haemorrhage is not known although disseminated intravascular coagulation is suspected. Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus and KFDV are two important viruses under the family Flaviviridae that are genetically closely related to TBEV, but produce haemorrhagic fever instead of encephalitis [3]. ECOLOGY KFDV was first isolated from sick monkeys cap- tured in Kyasanur forest of Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India, hence the name. Shimoga is located at 571 metres altitude, between 13�270 and 14�390 north longitude, and between 74�380 and 76�40 latitude. The Shimoga district of Karna- taka state is full of closed forests and few open for- ests (Figure 1). Shimoga has 276855 hectares of forest land. Wild monkeys, Presbytis entellus (Black faced langur) andMacaca radiate (Red faced bonnet monkey), are very common in the forest localities that commonly get infected by KFDV through bites of infected ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera). Other than Haemaphysalis spinigera, KFDV has also been isolated from 16 different types of ticks (Table 2). Unfed nymphs are highly anthropophi- lic and transmit the disease to humans bites. Ticks also transmit the virus transovarialy. Frequent transmission of KFDV via active nymphs has been reported during October to December months. Fed female adult ticks lay a huge number of eggs which hatch to larvae under the leaves in the forests. The ticks drop from leaves on small mammals and monkeys on which the larvae feed and later mature to nymphs, and the cycle is repeated (Figure 2). Bhat and his coworker [31] conducted a classical experiment, by allowing larvae of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides to feed on KFDV infected viremic rodents and rearing the KFDV infected larvae to the next generation. In this study they found that the fed larvae, nymphs, unfed adults, fed adult males and females after oviposition were infected, while the unfed larvae were free from infection. Nymphs and adults Figure 1. Map of Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India.

An infected adult tick shows a titre of 3–5� 106 mouse LD50/ 30 ml, and the virus can be detected for as long as 245 days after infection [31]. It has been shown that the presence of KFDV specific neutralising antibo- dies in fed blood has no effect on survival of KFDV in the ticks [39]. In Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab area), the central focus of the KFD was established in great part due to deep encroachment of human colonisation on a primitive sylvan territory. Originally, most of the vegetation consisted of tall rain forest interspersed with deciduous and semi-deciduous forest on the slopes and on the ridges of rolling hills with mixed bamboo and shrub jungle at the edges. The rainy season lasts from June to September, but the rain- fall varies greatly from one year to another, with a mean of 85 inches per year. The humid and rela- tively fertile bottoms between the terrain’s undula- tions are adequate for the cultivation of paddy fields. High humidity generated from the culti- vated fields is suitable for maintenance of the ticks throughout the year and availability of nearby for- est sustains a large population of wild moneys. Such ecological specificity is rarely seen in any other parts of India. All these in combination may be responsible for the geographical localisa- tion of KFDV only to Karnataka state of India. Local villagers staying in and around the forest area frequently visit the forest for collection of fire woods and get infected through tick bites. Generally women mostly visit the forest for fire wood collec- tion, whereas children do not. Men are in between. So, women have the highest opportunity to get infected whereas children have the lowest. The ecology of Shimoga area of Karnataka state is very special due to presence of divergent bio- types of forests, cultivated areas and grasslands in and around a common place. A local mechan- ism of maintenance of KFDV in this area presup- poses the presence of several elements. Presence of adequate animal reservoir in this area, a large population of carriers having consistent suscept- ibility, the ability to circulate KFDV and the cap- ability to infect an adequate number of vectors in Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area are thought to be important for sustenance of KFDV. A series of vec- tors with proved affinity for the reservoir host and capacity to become infected with KFDV acquired from the host is a critical factor for persistence of KFDV in Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area. Seasonal fluctuations of phase density of ticks in these areas are so timed that transmission of KFDV through Table 2.

EPIDEMIOLOGY In the Kyasanur Forest two species of wild mon- keys, Presbytis entellus (Black faced langur) and Macaca radiate (Red faced bonnet monkey), com- monly succumb to the natural infection with KFDV. Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 P. entellus and 186 M. radiata) died, and KFDV was isolated from 118 P. entellus and 13 M. radiata. High mortality of monkeys was generally observed from December to May which coincided with the seasonal activity of immature stages of Haemaphysalis ticks, the incriminated vec- tors of KFDV. Epizootiology of KFD in wild moneys of Shimoga, specifically the death of monkeys in dry seasons (February and March) correlates well with human cases of KFD [41]. Several studies have con- firmed the susceptibility of Macaca radiata (bonnet macaques) to KFD and demonstrated KFDV specific gastrointestinal and lymphoid lesions [42]. The epidemic period correlated well with the period of greatest human activity in the forest, after the monsoon (June-September) was over; i.e. November to December for the paddy harvest and December to May, the period to gather firewood and other for- est products [43]. KFD epizootic is initially characterised by the spread of the disease to the areas contiguous with the original focus of infection. Since the first record, the epidemics of KFD have occurred repeatedly in Shimoga district of Karnataka and in its adjoining areas. During the epizootic period of 1964–1965, monkey deaths occurred only within the previously known infected area. During 1965– 1966 the epizootic extended towards a contiguous forest south-east of Sagar town involving an area covering approximately 30 km2. The epizootics which appeared within the original infected area between October 1966 and September 1969 show- ed a tendency to move north-west of Sorab town. During the epizootic season of 1969–1970 and 1970–1971 monkey deaths occurred in Yakshi and Gudavi forests located further north-west of Sorab town. During 1971–1972, epizootics contin- ued to occur in the old focus of Sagar and Sorab taluk and occurred in a new focus at Gadgeri and a nearby valley. By the end of year 1973, epi- zootics and epidemics were recognised in several new foci, distant from the original focus. The new foci were Aramanekoppa in Hosanagar taluk of Shimoga district and Kodani in Honnavar taluk of North Kanara disctrict. It was also observed in certain localities of original focus (Barur, Jambai, Maisavi and Padavagodu) that the KFDV activity persisted over several years [44]. During 1975 epizootics KFD spread to Mandagadde area in Thirthahalli taluk, Shimoga district approxi- mately 50 km south–west of the periphery of Aramanekoppa focus. Later in during 1982 the dis- ease appeared at Patrame area in Beltangady taluk, South Kanara district, approximately 80 km south of the periphery of Mandagadde focus [44]. Other than Karnataka state, the primary site of introduction of KFDV, antibodies against KFDV have also been detected in humans in several parts of Kutch and Saurashtra of Gujrat state (semi-arid area, around 1200 km away from main focus of KFD) and isolated localities like Ramtek (near Nagpur), Kingaon and Parbatpur of West Bengal state of India [45]. A recent serological survey, con- ducted among the human population of the Andaman and Nicobar islands of India, reported the highest prevalence of HI (hemagglutination inhibition) antibodies against KFDV. Neutralising antibodies to KFDV were detected in Middle Andaman. Sex specific prevalence of neutralising antibodies to KFDV was significantly higher in males than in females in Andaman and Nicobar islands of India [46]. Considering the above find- ings, Andaman and Nicobar islands of India might be a major silent focus of KFDV activity, but there is no corroborative data from case reports of KFD. A variant genotype of KFDV, characterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma hae- morrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been identified in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [47]. AFHV was first isolated in the 1990s from the blood of a butcher. Since then a total of 24 cases were reported in the last 10 years and most of these cases were originated from Mecca or Jeddah of Saudi Arabia [48]. More recently, 37 cases have been reported through February 2001 to February 2003 from Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Until 1999, not more than three cases of AHF per year had been reported. Recent increase of AHF cases in Saudi Arabia may be due to better reporting and early identifi- cation of the disease. The transmission of most of the reported AHF cases was via wound, camel raw milk, tick/mosquito bite or direct contact with the infected animals. Although the sources of AHF Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 155155 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. infection are very diverse, most of the cases were localised in either Mecca or Jeddah. Any wide- spread epidemic of AHF has not occurred in Saudi Arabia perhaps due to scarce distribution of virus. In contrast, India has experienced several KFD epi- demics, although they have been very much con- fined to Karnatak state. Epidemics of KFD were controlled to a great extent after successful devel- opment of a formalin-inactivated vaccine pro- duced in chick embryo fibroblasts [20,49,50]. However, the recent data on the incidence of KFD cases (unpublished) from five districts of Kar- nataka state, namely Shimoga, Udupi, Mangalore, Chickmangalore and Uttar Kannada suggest that the number of cases has increased in the last five years despite the routine vaccination (Figure 3). CLINICAL, PATHOLOGICAL AND HAEMATOLOGICAL FEATURES Concurrently with the KFDV isolation and identi- fication, there have been KFD outbreaks of febrile and occasionally fatal illnesses among peo- ple living in the vicinity of Shimoga district of Kar- nataka. The incubation period before sudden manifestation of the disease varies between 3– 8 days (Figure 4). After this initial stage a biphasic course with mild meningoencephalitis and fever developing after an afebrile period of 1–2 weeks is common. Relative bradycardia is frequently seen along with inflammation of the conjuctiva. A small proportion of patients develop coma or bronchopneumonia prior to death. The acute phase of illness lasts for �2 weeks (Figure 4). The case fatality in KFD is 2–10% [1], significantly lower than in Alkhurma virus infection where case fatality has been reported to be 25% [51]. Conva- lescence in KFD survivors is generally pro- longed—up to 4 weeks (Figure 4). Viremia in KFD patients lasts for 12–13 days of illness and unlike most other arboviruses (Figure 4), KFDV is easily isolated from human sera. The level of virus in blood circulation is considerably high (3.1� 106), especially during the period of 3–6 days after the onset of illness [52]. Leukopenia is a constant feature in KFD patients and was due to a reduction in both neutrophils and lymphocytes. In most cases neutrophil count drops below 2000 cells/ml. Figure 3. Number of KFD positive cases per month spanning January 1999-January 2005 Figure 4. Viremia ( ) during the clinical course of KFD 156156 P. PattnaikP. Pattnaik Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. Lymphopenia was usually observed within the first week of illness and significant eosinopenia during the first or early in the second week. In several pati- ents lymphocytosis was also observed between the third and the fifth week [23]. Chatterjee et al. [53] considered that prominent thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in KFD are probably mediated through antibodies to platelets and leukocytes. They postu- lated that the KFD infection had directly or indir- ectly altered the antigenicity of these cells, triggering the production of antibodies to platelets and leukocytes. However, no experimental evidence is available in support of this postulation. Pathologic manifestations of KFD in human patients include parenchymal degeneration of the liver and kidney, haemorrhagic pneumonitis, and a moderate to marked prominence of the reticulo- endothelial elements in the liver and spleen, with marked erythrophagocytosis [54]. Pathologic and haematologic investigations emphasised similarities between KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever. Later there was a shift in clinical emphasis from haemor- rhagic to neurologic complications [55,56]. During KFDV infection, interferonemia is concomitant with the viremic phase. IgE has also been implicated as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possi- bly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23]. Neutralisation studies indicated that the endogenous (circulating) interferon (IFN) was antigenically similar to acid stable form of IFN-alpha. Sathe et al. [57] monitored endogenous IFN levels in acute (51) and convales- cent phase (19) sera collected from KFD patients and reported that the levels of circulating IFN in the acute samples (GM 216.3þ/� 8.7) collected between 4–7 post onset day (POD) were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the convalescent samples (GM 13.19þ/� 1.6) collected between 30–90 POD. Clinical or postmortem biopsies of various organs suggested that KFD could pass through four stages each lasting for about a week; i.e. a prodromal stage with fever, hypotension and hepatomegaly, a stage of complication charac- terised by haemorrhage, neurological manifestation or bronchopneumonia, a stage of recovery followed by a stage of fever in some cases. Adhikary Prabha and the coworkers [58] clinically studied 100 cases of KFD and conducted biopsies of various organs. They interpreted that hypotension in KFD could be of myocardial origin, whereas encephalopathy could be due to a metabolic cause probably of hepatic origin and lung signs due to intra-alveolar haemorrhage and secondary infections [58]. Clinical manifestations caused by Alkhurma virus (ALKV), a variant/strain of KFDV include fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, gen- eralized muscle pain, anorexia and vomiting asso- ciated with leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and ele- vated levels of liver enzymes, alanine transferase and aspartate transferase [48]. Like KFDV, ALKV also produces encephalitic features such as confu- sion, disorientation, drowsiness, coma, neck stiff- ness, hemiparesis, paraparesis or convulsion and haemorrhagic manifestations such as ecchymosis, pupura, petechie, gastrointestinal bleeding, epis- taxia, bleeding from puncture sites or menorrhagia [51]. Like other haemmorhagic fever viruses, both KFDV and ALKV are zoonotic [59]. Unlike other haemorrhagic fever viruses classified under the Arenaviridae (Lassa and Junin viruses), Bunyabviridae (Hantaviruses), Filoviridae (Marburg and Ebola viruses), KFDV and ALKV classified under the Flaviviridae are vector-borne with less intensity of haemorrhagic manifestations than the others. Unlike KFDV, ALKV is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites or direct contact with the infected sheep or goats and ticks do not seem to be important in the transmission [51]. Although ALKV and KFDV are somewhat similar in clinical presentations, high mortality (25%) reported for ALKV infection is surprising. However, this may be due to limited numbers of actually reported cases. As more cases get reported, the high mortal- ity indexes may drop for ALKV infections. MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY KFDV shares the highest sequence homology with ALKV, a Saudi Arabian flavivirus. They share many common features, i.e. TB-flavivirus specific pentapeptide DSGHD at position 320–324, the fusion peptide, AKG motif at position 2–4 of the capsid protein, an extra amino acid residue arginine at position 93 of the capsid protein, EHLPKA hexapeptide at position 207–212 and EGSK motif at position 308–311 of the envelope protein, amino acid substitution at position 76 and 489 of the envelope protein [47]. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that both of the viruses might have evolved more than 1000 years ago (Figure 5), originated in African subcontinent and might have a common ancestor [60]. According to the current genetic criteria of classification, KFDV and ALKV Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 157157 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. constitute two genetic subtypes of the same virus species [47]. The exact nature of spread of KFDV and its origin are not certain. One school of thought is that the virus might have got introduced to India via migrant birds. If so, why KFDV thereafter stopped being introduced into India by migrant birds or was not carried to other parts of India remains a question. Sudden appearance of KFDV in 1957 might be due to the first introduction by migrant birds. The virus did not spread to other parts of the country and got adapted to the regional environmental/ecological conditions. Another pos- sibility is that KFDV might have been introduced to India a long time ago through the slave trade and silently perpetuated in the subcontinent, result- ing in an epidemic only in the year 1957, when it was first identified and reported. In any event, the possibility remains that KFD was present before 1957 without being recognised or reported. Gould et al. [60] clearly stated in their classical review on evolution and dispersal of encephalitis viruses that KFDV appeared to be geographically isolated from other members of the mammalian tick-borne virus groups and that the discovery of AHFV in Saudi Arabia in 1995 [61] now provided a rational explana- tion for the presence of KFDV in the Indian forest. KFDV and AHFV produce a similar haemorrhagic disease and share strong genetic similarity. It was estimated that the two viruses might have diverged 500–600 years ago [60]. In contrast, a recent report by Charrel et al. [48] states that the ancestral lineage of KFDV and AHFVmight have diverged 66–177 years ago and that AHFV strains have a 4- to 72-year per- iod of evolution. Studies on the population dyna- mics of several flaviviruses indicated that Powassan virus might have originated 275–393 years ago and divergence between tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) might have occurred 291–411 years ago [48]. Gould et al. [60] argue that KFDV and other hae- morrhagic and encephalitic tick-borne viruses almost certainly exist in other parts of India and in those countries that connect Saudi Arabia with India, but their presence has not yet been recog- nised nor demonstrated. To support their idea they further state that phylogenetic analysis of Karshi virus isolates from Uzbekistan and Rift val- ley fever virus isolates from Afganistan suggest them to be close relatives of KFDV and that all of them are transmitted by ticks. KFDV stands out from the western subtype, fareastern subtype and Siberian subtype of flaviviruses in the phylo- genetic analysis. The analysis suggests that possi- bly the tick borne flaviviruses evolved gradually, whereas mosquito borne viruses evolved more rapidly to become more divergent in the course of evolution [62]. Langat virus, which was found in southern Asia, also closely relates to Middle Eastern and Asian haemorrhagic fever viruses. Another haemorrhagic fever virus named Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) found in Siberia primarily resembles KFDV and AHFV. From sev- eral studies, it appears that OHFV has circulated harmlessly among indigenous small mammals [63,64]. Initial thought was that occurrence of OHFV was geographically placed, but later it was confirmed that the virus had been introduced to Siberia through muskrats and other species from North America in the 1930s [63]. The phylo- gentic relatedness of most of the haemorrhagic fever causing flaviviruses suggests that all of them belong to old world viruses [60]. Amino acid sequence of the envelope glycopro- tein of KFDV was found to share 80% sequence homology with that of TBEV. KFDV shares 38– 40% sequence homology with dengue virus, Japa- nese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses with positionally conserved cysteines. Genetic recombination among RNA viruses is Figure 5. Phylogenetic relationship (unrooted tree) based on the amino acid sequences of the Domain III of E proteins of flavi- viruses. Close lineage of KFDV and Alkhurma virus suggests their co-evolution from common ancestral origin 158158 P. PattnaikP. Pattnaik Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. known to occur [65,66]. Sequence analyses of KFDV indicate only divergent mutational changes, suggesting origination by mutation, rather than by recombination. The partial complementary DNA sequence of the NS5 region of KFDV, which acts as RNA dependant RNA polymerase, shares 99% sequence similarity with that of Alkhurma virus, followed by a homology of 94% with TBEV; 93% with OHF, Langat, RSSE, Negishi viruses; 88% with Meaban virus; 87% with Kadam, Saumarez Reef, Tyuleniy viruses; 81% with Koutango and Alfuy viruses; 80% with Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Apoi viruses and 76–78% with dengue and other related viruses. The complete coding sequence of the prototype strain of Alkhurma virus, which shares the highest homology with KFDV, is known. Genetic analysis of several human strains of Alkhurma virus showed a very low diversity [48]. Sequencing of 5 strains of KFDV showed minimal genetic divergence but all the strains had been isolated within a short time period, i.e. 1956–1958 (R. Charrel, Université de la Méditerranée, Marseille, France, personal communication). Lack of complete sequence data of KFDV isolates spanning a longer time period limits its divergence analysis. ANTIGENIC STRUCTURE There have been relatively few detailed antigenic or molecular studies on KFDV. The nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the viral structur- al proteins and the deduced aminoacid sequences indicated that KFDV is a distinct member in the tick-borne flavivirus complex with the envelope (E) protein containing the unique protease clea- vage sites, fusion peptide, signal sequences and hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The virus belongs to the TBEV antigenic complex. Thus far, no antigenic difference has been found among KFDV strains. Among the structural proteins, the E protein showed maximum similarity (77.4– 81.3%) to those of tick-borne flaviviruses. Align- ment of the amino acid sequence with those of other known tick-borne flavivirus sequences revealed many conserved regions confirming its identity as a member of the TBEV group. Com- parison of the E protein amino acid sequences between TBEV and KFDV indicates a high degree of conservation of cysteine residues and the three potential N-glycosylation sites. Venugopal et al. [21] indicated that KFDV E protein has a threonine to lysine substitution at 211aa position in the tick specific genetic marker EHLPTA, and that another genetic marker AQE at amino acid positions 232 to 234 is unique for KFDV.

To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses was conducted with 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated by 90% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater titer, 78 (10.3%) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7.8%) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3.2%) for WNV, two (0.3%) for Cacipacore virus and one (0.1%) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes. The detection of WNV- seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub- regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.

Outbreaks caused by other flaviviruses have also been reported in the country. In the 1970s, the largest Brazilian epidemic of arbovirus encephalitis was caused by Rocio virus (ROCV) in southeast Brazil [3]. More recently, an outbreak of hemorrhagic manifestations was linked to Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) [4]. Sporadic human cases caused by other sylvatic flaviviruses, including Bussuquara virus (BSQV), Ilheus virus (ILHV) and Cacipacore virus (CPCV) have also been reported in Brazil [5], [6], [7]. Furthermore, yellow fever epizootics in howler monkeys were reported in 2008 and 2009. Approximately 200 carcasses tested positive for Yellow fever virus (YFV) and about 2000 deaths were reported [8]. Thirteen flaviviruses have been reported in Brazil, listed here in chronological order of discovery: YFV, ILHV, BSQV, SLEV, ROCV, CPCV, Dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and Dengue virus 4 (DENV-4), Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), Iguape virus (IGUV), Naranjal-like virus (NJLV), Dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and Culex flavivirus (CXFV) [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. In 2009, serological evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Brazilian horses, was collected for the first time, in the Pantanal wetland region of Mato Grosso do Sul state (MS) [21]. The Pantanal wetland is a subtropical region of great biodiversity with strong potential for maintenance and evolution of mosquito-borne viruses. Comprising approximately 140,000 km2, the Pantanal is a vast sedimentary floodplain characterized by seasonal flooding which determines specific ecosystem processes, with the occurrence of plants and animals that are adapted to the annual shrinking and expansion of habitats due to the seasonal hydrological regime [22]. The region, which covers mainly Brazilian but also Paraguayan and Bolivian territories, is ecologically classified into 11 sub-regions according to vegetation, flooding and physiography. In Brazil, the Pantanal is located within the states of Mato Grosso (MT) and MS in the west- central region of the country [23]. Most of the flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or understudied in the Pantanal. A small number of investigations in the Nhecolândia Sub-region of the Pantanal, MS, have detected serological evidence for four flaviviruses, including ILHV, SLEV, WNV and CPCV [21], [24], [25]. Recently, three other serological studies reported the detection of neutralizing antibodies PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706 for WNV in equines from MT and again in MS, including from outside the boundaries of the Pantanal [26], [27], [28]. Complete surveys for flaviviruses in the Pantanal have not been reported. Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for WNV and the 11 Brazilian flaviviruses of potential medical importance, utilizing equines, sheep and caimans as indicators. Materials and Methods In October 2009, April, September and October 2010, blood samples were taken from 724 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 16 beef cattle ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,700 square-km in the Nhecolândia Sub-region of Pantanal, MS, west-central Brazil (Figure 1). Ethics statement The collections for this study were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (License CEUA- Fiocruz LW-1/12, protocol P-74/10-5) in compliance with the requirements of Brazilian Law 11794/2008, which rules on the scientific use of animals, including the principles of the Brazilian society of Science in laboratory animals. The collections were also approved by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (licenses IBAMA 18363-1/2009 and 18363-2/2010). Caimans were captured in two ranches from sites where a high concentration of these animals was observed. Caiman blood samples were obtained by puncture of the internal jugular vein between the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae as described previously [29]. Information recorded about caimans included gender, weight and snout-vent length. Blood samples from equines, including horses, donkeys and mules, and from sheep were taken by puncture of the jugular vein in 14 and nine different ranches, respectively. Gender, age, tameness, breed, vaccination status, travel history outside of Pantanal and history of abnormalities, such as clinical signs involving the central or peripheral nervous system, were recorded for each equine sample. Information about gender, age, breed and travel history outside of Pantanal were also recorded for each sheep. All animals sampled appeared healthy except for one horse that presented with clinical signs suggestive of neurological disorder. Additionally, 36 horse samples collected in February 2010 from a ranch comprising roughly a 900-square-km area in the Nabileque Sub-region of Pantanal, also located in MS (Figure 1) were tested. An outbreak of an undiagnosed neurological syndrome had caused the death of 16 equines at this location from December 2009 to January 2010. All equines here were vaccinated for rabies and tested negative for Trypanosoma evansi, a common pathogen involved in incoordination and instability of hind limbs in Pantanal equines. These equines had not been vaccinated for equine encephalitis viruses at the time of the outbreak. After the first deaths, the herd was vaccinated for eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses. All samples were initially screened for flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA as described previously [30]. Briefly, the ability of the sera to block the binding of the flavivirus group- reactive monoclonal antibody 6B6C-1 to the cell lysate-derived antigen for WNV was compared to the blocking ability of negative control horse serum. Samples were considered seropositive when the inhibition values produced were $30%. Samples with inhibition values between 19 and 29% were repeated twice to confirm the negative results. Blocking ELISA-positive samples were then heat- inactivated and tested by PRNT90, as previously described [31], for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses. Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions that ranged from 1:10–1:320 or 1:20–1:640 of each blocking ELISA seropositive sample were tested for their ability to neutralize plaque formation by WNV, SLEV, ILHV, CPCV, BSQV, IGUV, YFV (vaccine strain 17D), ROCV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 (recombinant ChimeriVax Dengue 3 virus) and DENV-4. Caiman and sheep samples that were negative by blocking ELISA were also tested by PRNT90 for WNV. All reference viruses used for PRNT were previously submitted to partial nucleotide sequencing of the N terminal region of NS5 gene to confirm viral identity. High identity scores were obtained with the following sequences deposited at GenBank: DENV-1 (FJ562106), DENV-2 (GQ398257), DENV-3 (recombinant Chi- meriVax Dengue 3 virus) (JN811143), DENV-4 (GQ199880), ROCV (AY632542), SLEV (EF158048), ILHV (AY632539), YFV (JN628279), BSQV (AY632536), CPCV (AF013367), IGUV (AY632538), and WNV (JN819325). Serum was considered seropositive to a virus when it reduced at least 90% of the formation of plaques of this virus and its reciprocal neutralizing antibody titer was at least four-fold greater than what was observed for the other 11 tested flaviviruses. The PRNT is the most specific serological test for the differentiation of flavivirus infections in convalescent serum samples [32]. Type-specific antibodies against flaviviruses can be distinguished using the PRNT [33]. The conservative criterion of four-fold greater titer is based on the results of cross-neutralization tests with flaviviruses and their respective antisera used for studies of antigenic relationships [34], [35]. Two or more flaviviruses are distinct from each other by quantitative serological criteria (four-fold or greater differences between homologous and heterologous titers of both serum samples) [32]. The Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used to test for positive trends in seroprevalence among age classes (StatXact 10.0, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA) Results All caiman and sheep serum samples were negative for flaviviruses-specific antibodies using the 6B6C-1 monoclonal antibody by blocking ELISA. When tested by PRNT90 for WNV, all caiman samples confirmed negative. Sixty caiman Author Summary West Nile virus is maintained in cycles between birds and mosquitoes and recently reemerged as a worldwide major public health and veterinarian concern as the cause of human and equine encephalitis outbreaks. Recent studies have reported serological evidence of West Nile virus circulation in Pantanal, west-central region of Brazil. However, considering the co-circulation of various cross- reactive flaviviruses in Brazil and that most of the flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or understudied in the Pantanal, serological results should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for West Nile virus and the 11 Brazilian flaviviruses of potential medical importance, utilizing equines, sheep and caimans as indicators, including 32 equines collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder had been recently reported among the equines. We found serological evidence of Ilheus, Saint Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Cacipacore and Rocio viruses in Pantanal equines. West Nile virus infection was not associated with the neurological disease of equines. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub-regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.

From 238 sheep samples tested, 235 had PRNT90 titers , 10, two showed low neutralizing antibodies titers of 20 and 10 and one ,40. From 760 equine samples initially screened for flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA, 396 (52.1%) were positive. When this subset was tested using PRNT90, 332 (43.7%) had neutralizing reactivity (PRNT90 titer $10) for ILHV, 251 (33%) for SLEV, 172 (22.6%) for WNV, 139 (18.3%) for CPCV, 130 (17.1%) for ROCV, 62 (8.2%) for IGUV, 14 (1.8%) for YFV, 12 (1.6%) for BSQV, four (0.5%) for DENV-1, three (0.4%) for DENV-2, one (0.1%) for DENV-4 and none for DENV-3 (Table 1). Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater PRNT90 titer, 77 (10.1%) equines were seropositive for ILHV, 59 (7.8%) for SLEV, 24 (3.2%) for WNV (see Table 2), two (0.3%) for CPCV and one (0.1%) for ROCV. From the remaining 232 blocking ELISA positive samples, 227 (29.9%) were considered seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus due to cross-reactivity and five (0.6%) were considered seronegative with neutralizing antibodies titers ,20 or ,10 for all of the flaviviruses that were assayed by PRNT90. These five may represent infections by an unknown flavivirus. Figure 1. Pantanal located in west-central Brazil.

Monotypic neutralization reactions (i.e. a sample that reacted with only one of the 12 flaviviruses in the panel) were detected for ILHV (n = 27), SLEV (n = 11) and WNV (n = 6). The only horse from Nhecolândia Sub-region that presented neurological signs was seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus with the following PRNT90 titers: 80 for SLEV, 40 for ILHV, 20 for YFV, 10 for ROCV and ,10 for all other flaviviruses tested. Neutralizing antibodies for WNV were detected in 172 equines from all 15 ranches that equines were tested. Considering the four- fold higher titer criterion as confirmation, the 24 confirmed WNV- seropositive equines were detected in ten ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,500 square-km in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located in MS (Figure 2). Besides the 24 WNV-seropositive equines, samples from 37 other equines presented PRNT90 titers for WNV $40 and among them 26 showed equal or higher titers for one of the other flaviviruses tested. For these 37 equines, the serology profile could not be interpreted to determine whether WNV reactivity was due to infection with WNV or cross-reactivity from other flavivirus infections. In fact, six of them were considered seropositive for one of the 11 other flavivirus tested (Table 3). Low level of neutralizing antibodies was detected for YFV, BSQV, IGUV, DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4 even though none of the equines were considered infected with these viruses. In some cases, the PRNT90 titers for YFV, BSQV and IGUV exceeded 20. Both ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines were detected in 14 of the 15 ranches that equines were tested, comprising roughly a 3,100-square-km area. The only ranch that had no ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines was ranch PS (Figure 2). From 760 equines tested, 441 (58%) had date of birth available. Stratifying the serology results by age demonstrated that risk of exposure to flaviviruses increased with age for flaviviruses in general and for ILHV (1-tailed p,0.001 for both), but not for SLEV (p = 0.17) or WNV (p = 0.46) (Figure 3). SLEV and WNV appeared to increase in prevalence with age for equines ,9 years of age, but not for older animals. Equines seropositive for CPCV and ROCV were sampled in October 2009. The two CPCV-seropositive horses were five and seven years of age and were from ranch PQ, which comprises an area of approximately 140 square-km. The only horse that was seropositive for ROCV had no record of birth date and was from ranch PM that encompasses a 360-square-km area. At the end of 2009, an outbreak of neurologic disease among horses was reported from ranch PV located in the Nabileque Sub- region. From 36 equines sampled, 23 (63.8%) were seropositive for flavivirus infection by blocking ELISA. When this subset was tested by PRNT90, 11 (30.5%) confirmed seropositive for SLEV, nine (25.0%) for undifferentiated flavivirus(es), two (5.5%) for WNV, and one (2.8%) for ILHV (Table 4). Of the nine undifferentiated flavivirus infections, five had SLEV titers .20 and five had higher SLEV titers than other flaviviruses in the panel, indicating that a majority of these could have had a history of SLEV infection. In addition to the relatively low seroprevalence for WNV of just 5.5% in this sample of 36 equines, four equines from this group that recovered from the recent neurologic syndrome were serologically negative for WNV (Table 4). In spite of recent vaccination against equine encephalitis viruses, most equines had low titers for equine encephalitis viruses. These results will be described separately. Figure 2.

However, cross- reactive antibody responses to closely related flaviviruses can complicate interpretation of serologic test results [36]. In particular, secondary flavivirus infections generate high levels of cross-reactive antibodies, which further complicate the interpretation of flavivirus serology. The cross-reacting antibodies of primary infections typically react with other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup comprised by WNV, CPCV, SLEV and others principally in Africa and Asia [37], [38], but antibodies generated by secondary flavivirus infections can also bind and neutralize viruses of other serogroups as well. Moreover, some individuals that are sequentially infected by a heterologous flavivirus species can boost antibody levels against the original virus, resulting in a phenomenon known as ‘original antigenic sin’ which can lead to incorrect diagnoses [39]. Finally, the potential circulation of unknown flaviviruses in the region could generate cross-reacting neutralizing antibodies, and lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, we used a conservative threshold for detection of neutralizing antibodies (90%) and we considered homotypic serologic responses to be the most reliable, as these samples reacted with just one of the 12 viruses employed in the tests, with no indication of cross-reaction. In the present study, serological evidence of ILHV, SLEV, WNV, CPCV and ROCV circulation was detected in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of Pantanal. Nhecolândia is the second largest sub-region of Pantanal comprising roughly 27,000 square-km or 19% of the total Pantanal area and it is the world’s largest and most diverse area of subtropical lakes [40], [41]. Nabileque is the fifth largest sub-region comprising roughly 14,000 square-km or 10% of the total Pantanal area. This sub- region is formed by fluvial plains of the Paraguay River and remains flooded for nine months or more during the year [42]. The seroprevalence of ILHV and all flaviviruses combined increased with age in equines (Figure 3). This temporal pattern implies low-level enzootic transmission, where risk of infection increases with time. A drop in seroprevalence in the oldest age category that was observed consistently for all the flaviviruses evaluated may be explained by either waning of detectable antibodies over time, and/or weakening of the humoral immune response in older animals. In the case of SLEV and WNV, seroprevalence appeared to increase with age in the youngest three age categories, through age 9 years old, but the sample sizes were insufficient to detect a statistically significant trend. These increases in the youngest age groups may be explained by one or more introductions with establishment or not of these viruses after 2000 (i.e. within 9 years of the sampling time point in 2009– Table 3.

This finding corroborates the negative results found in a serosurvey conducted with local equines in the 1990s, when no neutralizing antibodies for SLEV were detected [24]. These data also corroborate the results of two other equine serosurveys conducted in the Nhecolândia Sub-region in February 2007 and February 2009, when neutralizing antibodies to SLEV were detected in three and four year old equines, respectively, which suggests that SLEV circulated between 2004–2007 [25] and 2005– 2009 [21], coinciding with two human outbreaks caused by SLEV in Argentina in 2005 [43] and southeast Brazil in 2006 [4]. In the present study, the detection of SLEV- and ILHV- seropositive geldings both born in September 26, 2009 and sampled on September 30, 2010 with no history of travel outside of Pantanal indicates that the transmission of SLEV and ILHV had occurred as recently as late 2009 or 2010. The enzootic status of ILHV is corroborated by the concurrent isolation of ILHV from Aedes scapularis specimens captured in the Nhecolândia Sub-region in 2010 [44]. Regarding WNV, the youngest seropositive equine was a 2 year-old untamed mare with no history of travel. Because it was sampled on October 23, 2009, the infection occurred between 2007 and 2009. The confirmed WNV-seropositive equines were detected in ten ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,500 square-km in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located in MS. Monotypic neutralizing reactions for WNV were detected in six ranches encompassing roughly 1,300 square-km, which com- prise approximately 20% of the Nhecolândia Sub-region area. WNV-seropositive equines were detected in Nhecolândia and Nabileque ranches located roughly 90 and 100 km distant from the city of Corumbá, MS respectively (Figure 2). Considering the detection of arbovirus activity in the Nabileque Sub-region which borders Bolivia and Paraguay, these two countries should consider our findings for their arbovirus surveillance programs. The two CPCV-seropositive equines were sampled October 20, 2009 at five years of age and no history of travel outside of Pantanal, which indicates that infection had occurred between 2004 and 2009. We report here for the first time the detection of ROCV- neutralizing antibodies in the Pantanal region. ROCV, which is an indigenous Brazilian flavivirus, was the causative agent of an extensive encephalitis epidemic in southeastern Brazil in the 1970s [3]. The detection of neutralizing antibodies for ROCV was unexpected, as current transmission events for ROCV are rare. Considering that the only ROCV-seropositive equine had no birth date available, the timing of ROCV transmission could not be clarified. No ROCV-seropositive equines were detected in two previous serosurveys for flaviviruses conducted in the same region [21], [24], which could indicate low circulation or recent introduction of ROCV in the Pantanal. No seropositivity for BSQV, IGUV, YFV and DENVs was confirmed among the equines tested in the present study. However, except for DENV-3, neutralizing antibodies were found to all the flaviviruses tested. More investigation is needed to understand the potential circulation of these viruses in the Pantanal region, as they may be restricted to ecological cycles for which equines, sheep and caiman fail to serve as indicators. A serosurvey of non-human primates and/or local human residents would be more instructive for these flaviviruses. Testing only equines may provide a biased view of the relative amounts of flavivirus transmission because equines may not mount immune responses to all viruses equally, or they may not attract all vectors equally. For example, they failed to generate primary immune responses to DENV-2 and SLEV [45] and would not attract large numbers of the yellow fever vector mosquitoes, which are primate specialists [46]. However, they are frequently exposed to mosquitoes and often utilized for arbovirus serosurveys elsewhere. Figure 3.

Received: 5 August 2013; in revised form: 9 September 2013 / Accepted: 10 September 2013 / Published: 17 September 2013 Abstract: In 2011 an unprecedented epidemic of equine encephalitis occurred in south-eastern (SE) Australia following heavy rainfall and severe flooding in the preceding 2–4 months. Less than 6% of the documented cases occurred in Queensland, prompting the question of pre-existing immunity in Queensland horses. A small-scale serological survey was conducted on horses residing in one of the severely flood-affected areas of SE-Queensland. Using a flavivirus-specific blocking-ELISA we found that 63% (39/62) of horses older than 3 years were positive for flavivirus antibodies, and of these 18% (7/38) had neutralizing antibodies to Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) and/or Alfuy virus (ALFV). The remainder had serum-neutralizing antibodies to viruses in the Kokobera virus (KOKV) complex or antibodies to unknown/untested flaviviruses. Amongst eight yearlings one presented with clinical MVEV-encephalomyelitis, while another, clinically normal, had MVEV-neutralizing antibodies. The remaining six yearlings were flavivirus antibody negative. Of 19 foals born between August and November 2011 all were flavivirus antibody negative in January 2012. This suggests that horses in the area acquire over time OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4433 active immunity to a range of flaviviruses. Nevertheless, the relatively infrequent seropositivity to MVEV, WNVKUN and ALFV (15%) suggests that factors other than pre-existing immunity may have contributed to the low incidence of arboviral disease in SE-Queensland horses during the 2011 epidemic. Keywords: flavivirus; equine; antibody response; mosquito-borne; encephalitis 1. Introduction More than 70 arthropod-borne viruses (“arboviruses”) have been isolated in Australia, but only a few have been implicated in human and livestock diseases [1]. The family Flaviviridae comprises three genera, the flaviviruses, pestiviruses and “hepatitis C-like viruses”. Only the flavivirus genus contains viruses that are transmitted by arthropods. Flaviviruses are small, 40–55 nm in diameter, enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA-viruses with a genome of ~11 kb which encodes three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The flaviviruses have been placed in nine serologically defined groups, with an additional few still to be classified. The type species of the flavivirus genus is yellow fever virus, with other major members being the dengue viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses [1]. Flaviviruses cause a wide variety of symptoms in humans and other mammals ranging from subclinical infection to mild fever, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, severe hemorrhagic syndromes or hepatitis and meningo-encephalitis [2]. In Australia, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) and a strain of West Nile virus (WNV) named Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) are the main aetiologic agents of viral encephalitis in humans, occurring as annual isolated cases or sporadic outbreaks, mainly in the north-western part of the continent [1]. MVEV is the more virulent pathogen, with morbidity and case fatality rates of 0.1–1.0% and 15–20%, respectively, and the only proven cause of fatal human cases [1]. In contrast, WNVKUN infections are less frequent and less severe [3]. Horses have been described as a susceptible species and have been involved in WNV outbreaks overseas, most notably the outbreak that commenced in the USA in 1999 [4]. In Australia, infection with WNVKUN has been observed in horses, but the disease has rarely been confirmed [5], while cases of equine MVEV-encephalitis are mostly, but not exclusively, seen under the same environmental conditions as those precipitating human MVEV cases (Barton et al., [6], unpublished data). Other flaviviruses circulating in Australia, but generally considered apathogenic or with very low virulence in mammals include Kokobera virus (KOKV), Stratford virus (STRV), Alfuy virus (ALFV) and Edge Hill virus (EHV) [7–10]. An incursion of JEV occurred in 1995 in the Torres Strait, but the virus did not become endemic and has not been diagnosed on the Australian mainland since 1998 [11–13]. Outbreaks of MVEV and WNVKUN encephalitis generally occur when heavy rainfall in northern and central Australia facilitates southward movement of the virus via infected water birds to flooded wetlands in south-east of the continent, notably the Murray Valley. These flooded areas provide an ideal environment for proliferation of mosquitoes which facilitates spillover from amplifying hosts (waterfowl) to susceptible hosts (horses and humans). Indeed, this scenario occurred in early 2011 following extensive flooding in the Murray-Darling basin and some other inland river systems with an Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4434 unprecedented outbreak of equine encephalitis in horses in south-eastern Australia [14,15]. There were 982 reported cases of horses displaying clinical signs consistent with arboviral disease with a case fatality rate of 5–20% [15]. Isolation and sequencing of a virus from the brains of fatal cases in New South Wales (NSW) revealed the aetiological agent for many cases to be a variant strain of WNV, most closely related to WNVKUN and named WNVNSW2011 [14]. Other fatal cases were due to MVEV. Despite very extensive flooding throughout Eastern Queensland, less than 6% of the reported cases of arboviral disease came from this state and of these less than half were diagnosed as caused by either WNVKUN or MVEV [15]. This prompted us to conduct a small-scale survey of the equine population at the University of Queensland (UQ) Gatton Campus, located in the Lockyer Valley, approximately 80 km west of Brisbane, and one of the more severely flood-affected areas during early 2011, with the aim of assessing flavivirus activity that might confer immunity and protection against flavivirus encephalitis. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Animals Blood samples were obtained from a total of 95 horses from the University of Queensland teaching and research equine herds, including 25 foals (0 to 5 months), eight yearlings and 62 adult horses (3–35 years). The majority of the horses were standardbred, thoroughbred or stock horse-standardbred crosses. All but six horses were either born at the Gatton Campus (all foals and yearlings and most of the adult thoroughbred horses) or had been pastured there for a minimum of 4 years, and most of the latter group originated from Queensland. The study was approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (approval numbers SVS/306/11/VAXINE and ANRFA/318/12). 2.2. Sample Collection Blood samples were collected by venepuncture into vacutainers (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and allowed to clot at room temperature, then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 3,500 rpm. Procured serum was stored at −20 °C in sterile cryovials until assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization following heat inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min. 2.3. Flavivirus Blocking ELISA All horse sera were originally screened for flavivirus-specific antibodies using a modification of an epitope-blocking ELISA [16,17]. U-bottomed 96-well polyvinyl chloride plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with an optimal concentration of flavivirus antigen [17] diluted in coating buffer (0.1 M carbonate/bicarbonate, pH 9.6) at 50 µL/well by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed twice in wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and nonspecific sites were blocked with 100 µl blocking buffer (0.05 M Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, 0.2% (w/v) casein, pH 8.0) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Reference or test sera were added (50 µL/well) in duplicate at dilutions of 1/5 and 1/10 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at RT. Non-immune horse sera were used as negative controls. Without removal of serum, 50 μL of pan-reactive monoclonal antibody (Mab) 4G2, targeting the flavivirus envelope protein [18,19], was added to each well and after gentle agitation the plates were incubated at RT for 1 h. Plates were washed four times Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4435 and bound Mab detected by incubation for 1 h at RT with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin pre-adsorbed for equine serum proteins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted in blocking buffer. Plates were washed six times and enzyme activity visualised by the addition of 100 µL substrate solution 1 mM (2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid); ABTS) and 3 mM H2O2 in a citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.2. Quantitative results were determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 405 nm, and percent inhibitions were calculated at 100—(OD (test)/OD (negative control) × 100). The cut-off for positivity was ≥30% inhibition and only positive samples were tested in the virus neutralization assays [16,17]. A similar blocking ELISA format was used to test for MVEV- and KUNV-specific antibodies using the Mab 10C6 [18] and 3.1112G [17], respectively. 2.4. Virus Neutralization Assay Heat-inactivated test sera were titrated in doubling dilutions from 1:20 to 1:2,560 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) without fetal bovine serum (FBS) in wells of a 96-well microtitre plate (Costar, Corning, NY, USA). Approximately 100 infectious units of MVEV (strain 1–51), WNVKUN (strain MRM16), ALFV (strain MRM3929), STRV (strain C338) or KOKV (strain MRM32) diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS were added to each well (50 µL) containing diluted serum (50 µL) and plates were incubated at 37 °C for an hour. Vero or porcine-stable equine kidney (PSEK) cells [20], resuspended in 50 µL of medium, were then added to each well at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and the plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-incubator before microscopic examination for cytopathic effect (CPE). Cells were also added to a 1:20 dilution of each serum in the absence of virus to ensure that the samples were not toxic to the cells. The neutralisation titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution where CPE was recorded. The cells were fixed in situ in the plates and subjected to an ELISA protocol [21] using anti-flaviviral E protein antibody, Mab 4G2, and pre-absorbed secondary antibody-conjugate to ascertain viral replication. 3. Results and Discussion Of 62 adult horses (age range 3–35 years) and eight yearlings tested 41 were positive in the flavivirus-specific blocking ELISA (63%), and of these 31 had neutralizing antibodies to one or more of the following flaviviruses: MVEV, KUNV, ALFV, STRV and KOKV (Tables 1 and 2). Blocking ELISAs using antibodies specific for MVEV (10C6) and KUNV (3.1112G) were also used to further analyse positive serum samples in the flavivirus-specific blocking ELISA. Horses positive for MVEV by blocking ELISA also had neutralizing antibodies against MVEV (T141, T143). However, some horses positive in the KUN blocking ELISA did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies against KUNV (T131, R10, T105 and T129). Seven horses were judged to have either given a false positive reaction in ELISA or, more likely, were positive for an unknown/untested flavivirus, such as EHV. Of the eight yearlings, all of whom were born at the UQ Gatton Campus, two had neutralizing antibodies to both MVEV and KOKV. One of the MVEV-positive yearlings (T143) presented with clinical encephalomyelitis and was eventually euthanatized due to persistent neurological sequela (Barton et al., unpublished data). The one MVEV-positive yearling not showing symptoms (T141) was retested again Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4436 in 2013 at age 3 years and was found to be strongly positive in the 4G2 blocking ELISA and had retained the same level of MVEV-neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). A total of 19 foals were born in the UQ herd between August and November of 2011, 11 by flavivirus antibody negative mares and eight to mares with KOKV-specific antibodies. The foals were serologically tested in January 2012, at which time they were between 74 and 152 days old. All 19 foals were negative in the flavivirus blocking-ELISA (included in the ≤2 years group in Table 1). Another six foals born in 2012 were all negative at birth, but two received passive antibody transfer via colostrums from naturally infected mares, and were still positive in the blocking ELISA 2–2.5 months after birth (data not shown). Two foals, one of which had received passive antibody transfer, were lost due to severe injuries. The remaining four foals were retested at the age of 6–7 months and all were still negative in the blocking ELISA. Table 1.

Ten horses (eight in the 11–20 years group and two in the >21 years group) had been employed in a JEV-vaccine trial during 2008 [22], and all were positive in the 4G2-flavivirus blocking ELISA. However, only three of these had neutralizing antibodies to MVEV (T106, T116, T115; Table 2). Since these three horses also had neutralizing antibody titres to ALFV equal to or higher than the MVEV neutralizing titre, it is more likely that the antibodies were induced by either or both of these viruses in the years since the vaccination rather than being cross-reactivity induced by vaccination with inactivated JEV. This supposition is further supported by the fact that MVEV-infection occurred in two yearlings in this location in 2011, and all ten horses still had low neutralizing antibody titres to JEV, yet seven were negative for MVEV, KUNV and ALFV. Neutralizing antibodies to KOKV was by far the most common source of flavivirus reactivity, with 25 of 40 flavivirus antibody positive horses having neutralizing antibodies to this virus (70% of flavivirus-positive horses; Table 2).

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4439 A previous serological study in 2008 of 13 horses (10 of which are also included in the 2011 cohort) demonstrated KOKV specific neutralizing antibodies in five horses (38%; [10]). Of these five only four horses were available for inclusion in the present study and only three of these horses still had antibodies to KOKV in 2011, although in one case this might have been cross reactivity to STRATV, suggesting that exposure to the virus is stochastic and possibly relatively infrequent. The natural host for KOKV is unknown, but wallabies and kangaroos have been surmised [23]. Furthermore, horses have also been suggested to contribute to maintenance of KOKV [10,23]. Also, large numbers of potential avian hosts (e.g., egrets (Ardeola ibis, Egretta spp.), herons (Nycticorax caledonicus), ibises (Threskiornis molucca, T. spinicollis), magpie geese (Anseranas semipalmata), whistling ducks (Dendrocygna eytoni), swamphens (Porphyrio porphyrio) and others) are associated with wetlands on the campus and surrounding areas, and an abundance of mosquitoes, notably Culex annulirostris, the main vector for the viruses included in this study ([24,25]; Andrew van den Hurk, personal communication, 2013). Antibody levels may decline relatively rapidly in the absence of re-exposure. This is in agreement with other studies showing that natural flavivirus exposure furnishes only relatively transient immunity [26], but contrast with studies of yellow fever virus-vaccination in humans in whom persistence of neutralizing antibodies for up to 30–35 years was demonstrated [27]. Possible explanations would be animal species and/or virus strain differences, infection dose and local versus systemic replication of virus [26,28–30]. It has been suggested that equines might be useful sentinels for flavivirus activity [31–35]. Thus, Nielsen et al. [32] concluded that immunologically naive horses are more sensitive for detection of WNV transmission than mosquito sampling alone. Similarly, Phoutrides et al. [34] concluded that horses constitute an important sentinel species for WNV in regions where they may have greater geographical range than other potential sentinel species. This is in contrast to Patnaik et al. [31] who found that birds, followed by mosquitoes and equines best predicted the occurrence of human WNV-disease cases in an urban area, while sentinel chickens had extremely low predictive success. The prerequisite for the usefulness of equines as sentinels would, of course, be absence of general use of JEV- and/or WNV-vaccination. Since in Australia JEV-vaccination is generally only used for horses being exported or going for competition in South-East Asia, and no WNV-vaccine is yet licensed and in use in Australia, using equines as sentinels for flavivirus activity could be given consideration, notably in the face of the 2011 WNV/MVEV epidemic in SE-Australia [15]. Our data, while based on a geographically limited survey, suggest that exposure to flaviviruses is a relatively infrequent event, at least in the study area, but that the likelihood of it occurring increases with the age of the animal, albeit at a slow rate. This is further supported by preliminary data from a 2012–13 survey of 118 horses, aged 2.5–7 years, racing at several venues in SEQ; less than 6% were positive in the flavivirus-blocking ELISA, and only half of these had low neutralizing antibody titres to WNVKUN, while none had antibodies to MVEV (unpublished data). It therefore seems advisable to focus on young horses less than 10 years as sentinels. Since viruses of the KOKV complex do not induce cross-neutralizing antibodies to MVEV and WNVKUN [10] and in our study only 10 out of 95 horses (10.5%) had neutralizing antibodies to MVEV, KUNV, or ALFV it seems unlikely that pre-existing immunity is the sole explanation for the limited occurrence of equine flavivirus encephalitis in QLD during the 2011 equine epidemic. This conclusion is further supported by the data from the race-horses. Other factors to consider would be ecological factors such as bird movements and a “flushing effect” due to the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 4440 severity of rainfall and flooding [32,36], or the presence of a cryptic host, e.g., rabbits, another bird species or another mammal, in the affected areas of SE-Australia. Variation in vector competence of different mosquito populations could also be considered. While Culex annulirostris is the major vector involved in transmission of flaviviruses in Australia and all isolates of WNVNSW2011 isolated from field-caught mosquitoes were from this species [14], then a previous study by Jansen et al. [37] demonstrated intraspecies variation in vector competence between populations. Notably, C. annulirostris gave an overall high level of vector competence for WNVNY99, but mosquitoes collected from Brisbane (SEQ) appeared less efficient vectors compared to populations collected from Sydney (NSW) and Cairns (North QLD). Thus, intraspecies variations of the main vector may have contributed to differences seen in transmission in different areas during the outbreak and may, at least in part, explain the low incidence of arboviral disease in SEQ. 4. Conclusions While a wide range of mosquito-borne flaviviruses circulate in SE-Queensland and horses in the region over time may acquire immunity to these viruses, the current survey suggests that horses under the age of 10 years could function as sentinels for medically important flaviviruses including WNV, MVEV and JEV. Moreover, further studies into the epidemiology and dynamics of WNVKUN, in particular, are warranted, as pre-existing immunity to flaviviruses of the JEV sero-complex clearly is not the explanation for the low incidence of arboviral disease in SE-Queensland horses during the 2011 epidemic.

Second St., Pomona, CA 91767 Abstract: We evaluated the prevalence of WNV and SLEV neutralizing antibodies in captive and free-ranging raptors from Argentina by plaque-reduction neutralization test. Eighty plasma samples from 12 species were analyzed. Only one captive adult Crowned Eagle (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus) was WNV seropositive (preva- lence: 1.25%; antibody titer of 1:80). Two captive Crowned Eagles were SLEV seropositive (prevalence: 2.50%; antibody titers: 1:80 and 1:40).These findings expand the geographic distribution of WNV and SLEV and confirm their activity in central and northeastern Argentina. West Nile virus activity in Argentina may rep- resent a potential threat to Crowned Eagles and other endangered raptors in this country. Keywords: West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, neutralizing antibodies, raptors, Argentina Since its arrival to North America in 1999 and subsequent dissemination through Central and South America (Nash et al. 2001; Komar and Clark 2006; Diaz et al. 2008; Pet- ersen and Hayes 2008; Hunsperger et al. 2009), concern has been raised about the possible effect of West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) on immunologically naı̈ve and endangered Neotropical birds populations (Saggese 2007; Blitvich 2008; Bataille et al. 2009). Raptors (Orders Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, and Estrigiformes) are particularly susceptible to WNV infection (Wünschmann et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010). High morbidity and mortality of raptors has been reported in the USA, Canada, and Europe (Gancz et al. 2004; Saito et al. 2007; Höfle et al. 2008; Nemeth et al. 2007, 2009). Different studies conducted in experimentally inoculated birds and also on free-ranging raptors show a gradient of no obvious illness, subclinical, clinical manifestation, and death across raptors infected with WNV (Nemeth et al. 2006; Ellis et al. 2007; Jiménez-Clavero et al. 2008; Ziegler et al. 2013).Published online: August 9, 2014 Correspondence to: Miguel D.

Combined with other well-recognized threats, avian pathogens may have a negative impact on wild raptor populations (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Those species with limited geographic distribution, reduced natural numbers, fragmented populations, and low heterozygosis are highly susceptible to the deleterious effects of emerging diseases, like WNV (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Threa- tened and non-threatened species of raptors maintained in zoos and rehabilitation centers for ex situ conservation programs may be at risk as well (Saggese 2007). WNV activity was detected in several central and northern Argentinian provinces, evidenced by the detection of neutralizing antibodies (PRNTAb), in a large mosaic of avian species, starting in the early 2000s (Diaz et al. 2008, 2011). Although no human encephalitis outbreak by WNV was reported, sporadic febrile human cases were observed. Beyond these few pieces of information, data surrounding distribution and impact of WNV in South America are scarce (Komar and Clark 2006; Morales et al. 2006; Peter- sen and Hayes 2008; Diaz et al. 2008). Another flavivirus co-circulating and re-emerging in the American continent is St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Spinsanti et al. 2009), which is broadly distributed in subtropical and temperate areas of Argentina (Dı́az et al. 2013). Although birds are not affected by SLEV infection, they have an essential role in the transmission and main- tenance of this virus (Reisen 2003). The presence of WNV activity in Argentina may rep- resent a considerable potential threat to both free-ranging and captive birds (Saggese 2007). However, the pattern of WNV and SLEV infection in Argentinean raptors remains basically unknown. In this study we evaluated the preva- lence of WNV and SLEV antibodies in captive and free- ranging birds of prey from Argentina. Sampling was conducted between March 2007 and April 2010 at selected zoos and wildlife rehabilitation centers and free-ranging raptors located in different geo- graphic areas of Argentina (Table 1). Plasma samples were tested for specific SLEV and WNV antibodies by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using autochthonous viral strains (WNV ArE/ 729906 or SLEV CbaAr-4005). The etiologic agent responsible for the infection was identified in serum diluted at least 1/10 following Diaz et al. (2008). A total of 80 plasma samples from 12 species of Ac- cipitriformes, 5 species of Falconiformes, and 4 species of Estrigiformes were analyzed. Only monotypic immuno- logical reactions were detected, no cross-reaction between viruses was observed. Only one sample was WNV sero- positive (prevalence: 1.25%; 1/80), an adult Crowned Eagle (antibody titer: 1:80) (Table 1) held captive in Casa Grande, Córdoba in January 2008 (Fig. 1). Two Crowned Eagles, one from Güira Oga, Misiones province and another one from Buenos Aires city, had detectable NTAb against SLEV (titers: 1:80 and 1:40, respectively). Overall, the prevalence of SLEV NTAb was 2.50% (2/80). The adult Crowned Eagle WNV seropositive was a captive bird housed with other birds of prey in an open-air aviary located in a rural-suburban environment of the Dry Chaco Eco region. Interestingly, a few days before sam- pling, an adult Crowned Eagle housed in the same aviary was found dead, although necropsy and additional post- mortem investigation were not pursued by the zoo. This finding confirms exposure in an endangered species, ex- pands the geographic distribution of WNV, and confirms its activity within Cordoba province (Diaz et al. 2008). Cordoba city, 81 km away, was the nearest site of WNV activity previously reported in raptors: an American kestrel (Falco sparverius) had been previously found seropositive, with a bird community seroprevalence of 1.1% between January 2005 and June 2006 (Dı́az et al. 2011), 2 years before our result reported here. At the moment, the others birds of prey seropositive for WNV in Argentina come from another American kestrel and a Rufous-thighed Hawk (Accipiter erythronemius), from a rural area of Northeastern Cordoba province and from an urban site of Tucuman province, respectively (Dı́az et al. 2011). The apparent absence of WNV activity in sampled raptors could be a result of the limited sampling size in some sites. However, a relatively large number of raptors tested in Misiones (33 individuals/17 species) were also negative. The lack of WNV seropositive birds in Misiones province is surprising considering recent reports of WNV activity in the closer Corrientes and Chaco provinces, where free-ranging black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) had a seroprevalence of 19.81% in 2010 (Morales et al. 2011). Furthermore, this lack of exposure could indicate a high susceptibility to future infection and a potential conservation risk for endangered captive and free-ranging raptors inhabiting Misiones.

Quaglia et al. the largest captive collections of forest eagles in Argentina and these birds have a high value for ex situ conservation programs. Contrasting with the WNV activity in USA and Canada, no mortality events have been reported in Neotropical birds (Komar and Clark 2006; Dı́az et al. 2011). Reasons for this difference are not clearly understood, but circulation of bird- attenuated viral strains, avian host WNV infection resistant, co-circulation of antigenically related flaviviruses, and dilu- tion effect of viral activity in a richer mosquito and avian community have been suggested (Gubler 2007; Swaddle and Calos 2008; Keesing et al. 2010). Moreover, lack of a proper surveillance system could likely encrypt the actual WNV activity in the region (Petersen and Hayes 2008). One adult Crowned Eagle SLEV seropositive was a captive female in Güira Oga for more than 12 years and Figure 1. Spatial distribution of WNV and SLEV seropositive and seronegative raptors in Argentina, 2007–2010. WNV and SLEV Seroprevalence in Raptors, Argentina 607 sampled in March 2008. Based on its antibody titer of 1:80 we suspect that SLEV infection was recently acquired. Hodara et al. (1991) described SLEV seropositive people when studying prevalence of several arthropod-borne dis- eases in Misiones province, but technical limitations of their work precluded conclusions about the exact identity of the specific antibodies (a non-specific hemagglutination inhibition test was used by these investigators). Therefore, this is the first confirmation of SLEV activity in this province. The other SLEV positive Crowned Eagle was a juvenile found in San Juan province (western Argentina) and moved to Buenos Aires for rehabilitation 2 months before the sampling date (April 2009). The low titer (1:40) and the history of recent movement suggests two potential sce- narios for the infection origin. Between January and May 2009, a SLEV case was registered in Buenos Aires (López et al. 2011) suggesting infection of this bird may have oc- curred during this time. Alternatively, if this eagle was in- fected in San Juan before its arrival in Buenos Aires, this would demonstrate viral circulation at least 2 years previ- ous to a recent urban outbreak (López et al. 2011). Unfortunately, no other birds were investigated for SLEV NTAb. Recently, the use of zoo collections and rescue centers has been advocated for disease surveillance (Nemeth et al. 2007; Pultorak et al. 2011). In Argentina, human health surveillance programs are designed to report encephalitis and fever syndromes with infrequent etiological confir- mation, although prophylactic measures are rarely imple- mented as result. Raptors, and other species of birds, are highly susceptible to WNV and SLEV infection (Wünsch- mann et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010) mounting an antibody response to detectable levels by serological tests such as ELISA and PRNT (Nemeth et al. 2007). Zoo and rehabilitation centers house a large number of birds from different orders including raptors, parrots, waterfowl, etc. that could constitute an excellent, sensitive, and operative source of biomedical samples for WNV and SLEV activity surveillance (Nemeth et al. 2007; Pultorak et al. 2011). Our data confirm the endemic circulation of WNV in the province of Cordoba, according with previous evidence and suggest a wide geographic distribution of SLEV and WNV in Argentina (Diaz et al. 2008). Our limited sample size did not allow confirming the absence of viral activity in raptors at locations where only seronegative birds were found, potentially underestimating the real infection status of raptors at the present time. However, this represents the first screening for flavivirus serological status in birds of prey at a large spatial scale in Argentina and South America. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank D. Ramadori, H.

Reisen and Sarah S. Wheeler* Abstract From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds comprising 152 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and released at four study areas within California, from which 28,388 additional serum samples were collected at one or more recapture encounters. Of these, 142, 99, and 1929 birds from 41 species were positive for neutralizing antibodies against western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), or West Nile virus (WNV) at initial capture or recapture, respectively. Overall, 83% of the positive serum samples were collected from five species: House Finch, House Sparrow, Mourning Dove, California Quail, and Western Scrub-Jay. Temporal data supported concurrent arbovirus surveillance and documented the disappearance of birds positive for WEEV in 2008 and SLEV in 2003 and the appearance of birds positive for WNV after its invasion in 2003. Results of these serosurveys agreed well with the host selection patterns of the Culex vectors as described from bloodmeal sequencing data and indicated that transmission of WNV seemed most effective within urban areas where avian and mosquito host diversity was limited to relatively few competent species. Key Words: Avian banding—Avian serology—St. Louis encephalitis virus—Western equine encephalomyelitis virus—West Nile virus. Introduction The mosquitoborne encephalitis viruses, includingwestern equine encephalomyelitis virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus, WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (Flavivir- idae, Flavivirus, SLEV), and West Nile virus (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus, WNV), were or are now endemic to California. WEEV originally was isolated in 1930 from a horse that succumbed from encephalitis in Merced County during a large epizootic of equine disease in the Central Valley of California (Meyer et al. 1931). SLEV was recognized as a cause of summer encephalitis in residents of the San Joaquin Valley in 1937 (Howitt 1939), soon after its initial isolation in Missouri (Muckenfuss et al. 1934). Both viruses remained active each summer in the Central Valley, where they were an important public and veterinary health concern through the 1980s, with enzootic and occasional epidemic-level trans- mission (Reeves et al. 1990). Subsequently, the activity of both viruses declined in the Central Valley (Reisen et al. 1990), with the exception of a small SLEV outbreak of hu- man disease in the San Joaquin Valley in 1989 (Reisen et al. 1992b) and widespread zoonotic transmission of WEEV in the Sacramento Valley in 1993 (Reisen et al. 1995a). An outbreak of SLEV also was documented in Los Angeles in 1984 (Murray et al. 1985), with continued low-level enzootic transmission (Work et al. 1985, Reisen et al. 1992c) recorded occasionally through 2003. Enzootic transmission of WEEV and SLEV was documented consistently in the southeastern deserts of California from 1967 through 2003 (Meylan et al. 1989, Reisen et al. 1992a, 1996c, Reisen et al. 2002), with infrequent human disease (Reisen et al. 1996a, Reisen and Chiles 1997). Although enzootic WEEV transmission was detected briefly in 2005–2007, SLEV essentially disappeared from California from 2004 through 2013. WNV invaded California through the southeastern deserts during 2003 (Reisen et al. 2004), just 5 years after being discovered in New York City (Lanciotti et al. 1999), spread to every county in the state by the end of 2004 (Hom et al. 2004), and has remained continually active since this time, with human disease detected annually (Feiszli et al. 2013). WEEV and SLEV were not detected in mosquitoes from 2007 and 2003, respectively, through 2013, despite the continued Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Vectorborne Diseases, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California. *Current affiliation: Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, California.

Widespread vaccination and natural immunization have limited the number of equine cases of both WEEV and WNV diseases reported annually. The cascade of events that have led to the above transitions in arbovirus activity remain unclear, although the California landscape has changed dramatically since the 1930s. The state human population has grown from ca. 7M in 1930 to 37M by 2010, with extensive urbanization of the Los Angeles Basin and the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley. Ex- tensive intermittent wetlands of the Central Valley have been converted to farmland, and vernal runoff is now managed by engineering projects along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. Concurrently agricultural production has risen from $7.3 billion in 1974 to $45 billion/year in 2011, even though some of the original farmland was converted to housing. This increase in farm production followed the completion of the extensive Central Valley Water Project bringing Sacramento River water into the arid west side of the San Joaquin Valley through several major canal systems and to Los Angeles through the California Aqueduct (www.water.ca.gov/swp/ cvp.cfm, accessed 30 Aug 2015). Agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley transitioned from cotton and fodder to carrots, grapes, almonds, and dairy production. Following an exten- sive drought in the 1980s, farming practices such as tailwater recycling and laser leveling were adopted to conserve water. Collectively, these changes to the California landscape al- tered mosquito and avian populations and impacted arbovirus epidemiology (Reeves and Milby 1989). In addition, the epidemics that followed the invasion of California by WNV resulted in the expansion and improvement of mosquito control programs. Birds are the vertebrate hosts for these three encephalitis viruses and therefore have been studied intensively since their role in transmission was discovered in the 1940s (Hammon et al. 1943). Extensive field studies during 1946– 1951 in Kern County carefully characterized bird commu- nities in rural, agrarian, and periurban habitats, documented their seasonality and migration status, and described their nesting habits (McClure et al. 1962). A subset of these birds were tested for antibodies using a mouse protection neutral- ization assay, of which 17% (n = 1147) and 9% (n = 1039) were positive for WEEV and SLEV antibodies, respectively (Reeves and Hammon 1962). Of the bird species tested, House Finches, House Sparrows, and Bullock’s Orioles were positive most frequently. The adaptation of the hemaggluti- nation inhibition assay allowed for rapid and extensive test- ing of wild birds to detect the prevalence antibodies. During 1952–1973 in Kern County and 1969–1973 in Butte and Glenn Counties, a total of 14,713 blood samples from 131 species of wild birds were tested for antibodies, of which 4% were positive for WEEV and 3% for SLEV, respectively (Milby and Reeves 1990), a marked decline from the previ- ous survey, although resident peridomestic passerines again emerged as the most frequently infected species. Our studies on the role of birds in the ecology of arbo- viruses commenced at wetlands along the Salton Sea in the Coachella Valley in 1996, following our discovery that WEEV and SLEV seemed to overwinter in this area and then disperse upland in the Coachella Valley (Reisen et al. 1995b, 1995c) and perhaps to other areas of California. The com- bination of agricultural, desert, and wetland habitats in this area along the Pacific Flyway has enabled one of the most diverse avifauna in North America, with >380 species listed at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (www.fws.gov/ refuge/Sonny_Bono_Salton_Sea/wildlife_and_habitat/index .html, accessed 19 Nov 2015). We were interested to deter- mine which of these species were infected most frequently, may disseminate virus elsewhere, and how these results re- lated to our understanding of mosquito host-seeking behav- ior (Lothrop and Reisen 2001), host selection (Thiemann et al. 2012, Reisen et al. 2013a), and arboviral amplification. For comparison, similar studies were initiated in Kern County in 1997 at some of the same collection sites used previously by McClure and colleagues (Milby and Reeves 1990), allowing us to investigate the impact of landscape change in the San Joaquin Valley on antibody seroprevalence within the avian community. After the arrival of WNV, ad- ditional sampling was initiated at urban habitats in Los An- geles in 2003 (Kwan et al. 2012) and at suburban and rural FIG. 1.

Data summarized from the State of California Arbo- virus Surveillance Program show consistent activity of WEEV and SLEV until after the invasion of California by WNV in 2003 (Hui et al. 1999, Steinlein et al. 2003).

ANTIBODIES AGAINST ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES IN CALIFORNIA BIRDS 265 habitats at the city of Davis in the Sacramento Valley (un- published data). The current article summarizes data on birds that became infected and survived to produce antibody and therefore compliments our recent article on those birds that succumbed during infection and were tested as part of the dead bird surveillance program for WNV (Foss et al. 2015). Materials and Methods Bird collection areas were selected near wetlands around the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, Riverside County, in the San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield, Kern County, and in the Sacramento Valley near Davis, Yolo County, and at multiple urban sites throughout Los Angeles. The locations of fre- quently used collection sites are summarized in Table 1. Additional sites were tried and then discontinued because of low collection success, vandalism, or other logistical reasons. Multiple net lanes and bird trap sites were tried at each lo- cation until productive positions were selected for repeated sampling. For netting, three sites at each of the three areas were selected each season and sampled on two consecutive days during each 2-week period, depending upon weather. Each site contained from 7 to 15 mist net locations and multiple small and large grain-baited traps, except for Los Angeles sites where a single modified crow trap was operated at each of seven fixed sites. Mist nets were mostly 2.6 · 12 meters with 38-mm mesh (some with 60-mm mesh were used to collect large birds) and were operated starting at dawn for 3–5 h each day, depending upon catch size and weather. Australian crow traps with drop-in top slits modified for sparrows and/or walk-in bottom cone entrances (McClure 1984) were baited with mixed wild birdseed and water and operated for 24 h for 2 days at each location during each sampling rotation. Additional bird serum samples were col- lected opportunistically, including samples from waterfowl at the Kern NWR during an avian cholera outbreak, birds taken to wildlife rehabilitation centers, heron chicks sampled at a heronry near Davis, and birds taken under depredation permits by aquiculture, pigeon, and vineyard bird removal programs. Birds were identified to species and aged using plumage and/or skull ossification (Pyle 1997) and banded using ap- propriate USGS bands (www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/). Some species such as quail and pigeons were not provided federal bands; these species were either not banded or banded with non-USGS sequentially numbered plastic or aluminum bands (National Band and Tag; Newport, NY). A 0.05 or 0.1 mL blood sample (depending on bird size) was taken by jugular venipuncture using a 0.5-mL tuberculin syringe with a 28 g needle and immediately diluted with 0.9 mL saline; some pigeons and doves were sampled from the brachial vein. Birds recaptured on consecutive days were immediately re- leased and not resampled. Samples were clarified by centrifugation and then stored at -20�C until screened for antibody by an enzyme immuno- assay (EIA) using a conjugated anti-bird detector antibody (Chiles and Reisen 1998, Ebel et al. 2002) produced com- mercially in goats by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Mon- tgomery, TX). Each sample was tested in three wells using a 96-well plate format—two wells with crude viral antigen and one without antigen. Separate plates were precoated with WEEV or SLEV antigen. Using this EIA, birds experimen- tally infected with WNV or SLEV produced antibodies equally reactive with our SLEV crude antigen (Fang and Reisen 2006), so SLEV antigen was used to screen serum samples for antibody against both flaviviruses. Samples with the ratio of the mean absorbance of the two antigen-positive wells divided by the antigen-negative well that were ‡ 2 were confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Samples were considered confirmed when endpoint titers on Vero cell culture had >90% reduction of 75–100 plaque- forming units (pfu) of WEEV, SLEV, or WNV at a dilution of ‡ 1:20. Because SLEV and WNV cross-reacted in our EIA and PRNT assays (Fang and Reisen 2006, Patiris et al. 2008), the purported infecting virus was required to produce an endpoint titer ‡ 4· the competing virus. Positive bird sam- ples were reported once and were limited to those birds with a confirming PRNT90 titer ‡ 1:20 or ‡ 4· the competing virus. Results From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds com- prising 151 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and re- leased, of which 142, 99, and 1929 individuals had serum samples with neutralizing antibodies positive against WEEV, SLEV, or WNV, respectively, at either initial capture or at one or more recapture events (Table 2). Because the number of samples required to detect a positive serum varied among birds, data are presented as the number of individual birds that were detected as positive among all birds sampled. An additional 3732 birds from 137 species were bled, but not banded, of which 16, 39, and 86 were positive for WEEV, SLEV, or WNV, respectively (Table 3). These latter samples came from birds that were not authorized for USGS bands Table 1.

DOI: 10.1089/vbz.2006.0626 West Nile Virus Circulation Detected in Northern Italy in Sentinel Chickens ANNAPAOLA RIZZOLI,1 ROBERTO ROSÀ,1 FAUSTA ROSSO,1 ALAN BUCKLEY,2 and ERNEST GOULD2 ABSTRACT Ninety percent (56/62) of sentinel chickens introduced to two regions within the Italian Alps seroconverted to West Nile virus (WNV) during the summer of 2005, showing a range of antibody titres from 1/20 to 1/320 in a virus neu- tralization test. Neutralization specificity for WNV antibodies was confirmed on an additional 34 sera that were tested in parallel against WNV (16/34 seropositivity), Usutu virus (3/34 seropositivity) and Koutango virus. The geometric mean neutralizing titre (GMT) calculated for WN-specific antibodies was 33.68 and did not differ sig- nificantly amongst sample sites, although the overall results indicate more active circulation of WNV at the higher elevations. Such high levels of seroconversion raise the possibility that many chickens may have been exposed to virus via routes other than mosquito transmission. No chickens or any other local animals were associated with illness due to WNV implying that WNV, and to a much lower extent Usutu virus, circulate harmlessly amongst wildlife species in northern Italy from late May onwards until early autumn.

The virus is carried to Europe by birds that migrate be- tween Africa, Asia and Europe. It is transmit- ted to non-migratory resident birds and mam- malian hosts by ornithophilic mosquitoes such as Culex spp. (Hubalek and Halouzka 1999, Malkinson and Banet 2002, Gould et al. 2001, Buckley et al. 2003). Although WNV has been shown to be pathogenic for humans and a wide range of mammalian and bird species (Mc- Clean et al. 2002), in the Old World it appears to circulate relatively harmlessly, as demon- strated by the detection of antibodies in a num- ber of healthy avian species (Gould et al. 2006, Buckley et al. 2006). However, outbreaks of West Nile fever have been recorded in several European and Mediterranean countries during the last decades, including Romania, Russia, Is- rael and Italy (Murgue et al. 2002, Autorino et al. 2002). The introduction of WNV to North America in 1999 (Jia et al. 1999, Lanciotti et al. 1999, Roehrig et al. 2002) led to widespread epi- demics that currently do not appear to be re- ceding in intensity. Despite the enormous num- ber of publications on WNV epidemiology, relatively little is known of the ecology and nat- ural history of WNV transmission in Europe, and most WNV outbreaks in humans and ani- mals remain unpredictable and difficult to con- trol (Dauphin et al. 2005). The unexpected ap- pearance of Usutu virus (USUV) causing fatal infections in birds in Austria in 2000 (Weis- senbock et al. 2001) and the occasional cases of WNV in horses in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002) 1Centre for Alpine Ecology, Trento, Italy. 2Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, United Kingdom.

F or p er so na l u se o nl y. and France (Durand et al. 2002) have increased our awareness of emerging arbovirus patho- gens in Europe. Thus, early detection of virus activity in animals, and analysis of the ecolog- ical conditions that characterise WNV-active geographic regions would be useful to devise disease monitoring and early warning systems. The Trentino-Alto Adige region of northern Italy is located under one of the important bird migratory routes across the Alps between Africa and Europe. To assess whether or not WNV circulates in this area and the period of its major activity, we monitored WNV-specific seroconversion in sentinel chickens placed on open ground during the summer of 2005. The use of sentinel chickens is known to be a cost- effective and non-invasive alternative to the use of wildlife species for detecting WNV cir- culation (Buckley et al. 2006) and is used fre- quently throughout North America to monitor the presence of this virus. METHODS Fifty-two hand-reared 2-week-old chicks were placed in two different fenced open areas with other farm birds on May 4 until August 28, 2005. Fourteen of these chicks were lost by predation during the sampling period. Serum was collected fortnightly from each chicken; it was clarified by centrifugation and stored at �20°C. One site was located in Fiemme Valley (Tesero, altitude 997 m above sea level) a mountainous area of the Dolomites where the mean annual temperature is 7.65°C, and the to- tal annual rainfall is 688.6 mm (Fig. 1). The sec- ond site (Pietramurata, altitude 549 m above sea level) was located in the Lake Valley dis- trict, an area characterized by the presence of lakes, with a mean annual temperature during 2005 of 9.88°C and a total annual rainfall of 854.2 mm. An additional 10 chicks were placed in Cavedine, located near Pietramurata site, on June 21, 2005. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to an African strain of WNV (WN-DAK) using the 50% plaque re- duction neutralization test (PRNT50) described previously (Buckley et al. 2003, 2006). All plaque reduction tests were performed blind; the sera were numbered in Italy with no indi- cation of their identity and they were tested in Oxford, UK. The results were subsequently de- coded in Italy. The number of seroconverting sentinel chick- ens (i.e., with a titer � 1/20) was estimated at fortnightly intervals. The geometric mean anti- body titer (GMT) was calculated for PRNT50 as described in Thrusfield (2005). To confirm WNV antibody specificity, the sera of an addi- tional 34 adult chickens kept on the same farms and having similar exposure to mosquitoes and migratory birds during the years 2005 and 2006 were collected during August 2006. These sera were multi-tested using PRNT50 against the lin- eage 1 (WN-DAK) strain of WNV (Lanciotti et al. 2002) and closely related Usutu virus (USUV) and Koutango virus (KOUV). Statistical analysis To assess differences in titers among sites, we performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS Table 1 presents a summary of the PRNT50 results obtained from the 62 sentinel chickens that were monitored fortnightly on three sites of the Province of Trento during 2005. The individual volumes of serum from May 4, 2005 through June 28, 2005 were too small for analysis at a 1/10 dilution. Therefore, the data are expressed with the lowest positive titre being 1/20. However, in the older chickens the volumes of sera were slightly larger and could be titrated from 1/10 dilution. Thus, all posi- tive results, i.e., including those from 1/10 di- lution, are presented in Table 1. Of the original 52 chicks that were placed in May on the farms of Tesero and Pietramurata, 47 (90%) individ- uals seroconverted to WNV showing an anti- body titer of at least 1/20, and in many cases, the titers increased during the period of expo- sure. The GMT recorded at these sites was re- spectively 35.25 in Tesero and 31.46 in Pietra- murata. Eleven of 52 chicks that had been kept in- doors until they were 2 weeks old were already seropositive for WNV before being released RIZZOLI ET AL.412 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 3/ 04 /1 9.

However, 2 weeks later, eight of these chicks showed an antibody titer of �1/20, while nine new seroconversions (�1/20) were recorded, implying exposure to WNV. The number of seroconversions increased significantly during May and then continued to increase more gradually until the end of July (Fig. 2). The additional 10 chickens that were placed outdoors at Cavedine on June 14, 2005 sero- converted within 2 weeks from 10% (1/10) on June 21 to 100% (10/10), with titers ranging from 1/20 to 1/160. All of these sera remained positive with gradual increases in titer for the remaining period of observation and with a GMT of 32.62. In order to increase the stringency of the tests and thereby to detect stronger immune re- sponses, the positive PRNT50 samples were re- calculated using a 90% plaque reduction end- point. The Tesero samples recorded 5/26 PRNT90 positive samples with titers of 1/20 on June 29, 2005 and 8/25 positive samples on July 13, 2005 with titers ranging from 1/10 to 1/40. Prior to June 29, 2005, no samples from any of the sites recorded PRNT90 positive samples. These results appear to suggest that Tesero showed greater viral activity than Pietramu- rata. However, the comparison of the GMT us- ing PRNT50 titers did not differ statistically (F(2,271) � 1.28; p � 0.27). The more stringent tests demonstrate that, during the period of major seroconversion (May to late July), im- mune responses in some chickens were equiv- alent to those that would be expected in ani- mals that presented with clinical symptoms. However, it is known that, although chickens respond immunologically to infectious WNV, they do not succumb to disease caused by this virus (Komar 2003). Of the 34 additional sera multi-tested for West Nile virus (WN-DAK), Usutu virus (USUV), and Koutango virus, 16/34 produced positive WN virus results but only 3/34 were positive for USUV, of which two were negative for WNV. These combined observations con- firm the specificity of the test for WNV or a very closely related virus. The third serum had a high titer (1:80) against USUV, a slightly lower titer against WNV, and a low titer against KOUV. This is almost certainly an example of antigenic cross-reactivity because of the higher titer. Two sera showed low antibody titers (1/10) for KOUV, but were negative against WNV and USUV. We conclude that these tests WNV DETECTED IN NORTHERN ITALY IN SENTINEL CHICKENS 413 FIG. 1.

DISCUSSION WNV causes human epidemics and is also known to circulate amongst a wide range of wildlife species in Russia (Lvov et al. 2004) and the Czech Republic (Ernek et al. 1977, Barkonyi et al. 2005, Hubalek and Halouzka 1999). More- over, a variety of strains of the virus have been isolated several times in these countries. Ro- mania suffered a significant human epidemic outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1996 and further outbreaks in 1997 and 1998 (Savage et al. 1999, Cernescu et al. 2000). Nevertheless, de- spite these epidemics in central Europe, and al- though there have been sporadic cases of WNV infection in wildlife species, in general this virus has not caused significant human epi- demic outbreaks in western European coun- tries. Thus, WNV is not considered to present a major epidemic threat to humans in this area of Europe. Occasional cases of neurological dis- ease due to WNV have been recorded in horses in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002) and in the Ca- margue region of France (Durand et al. 2002), and serological evidence of the presence of a WNV-related virus has been obtained in many other parts of Europe (Buckley et al. 2003, Mur- gue et al. 2002). Thus, there is concern that WNV has the potential to cause human epi- demic outbreaks in Europe, but at this time, we have no clear understanding of the underlying ecological and epidemiological basis for WNV epidemicity. The data presented in this brief study are based on the plaque reduction neutralization test which is more discriminating than other serological tests following primary immuno- logical responses (Burke and Monath 2001). The results obtained by testing in parallel the sera of adult chickens, exposed for at least two subsequent years to mosquitos bites or to con- tact with migratory birds, clearly indicate that the neutralization results are highly specific and can discriminate between antibodies due to exposure to different flaviviruses which may circulate in the same geographic area. The PRNT results presented in this study therefore show clearly that WNV, or a very closely related virus, and to a lesser extent USUV, are transmitted to sentinel chickens and presumably to other outdoor animals or hu- mans in Northern Italy, despite the fact that there are no records of recognized neurologi- cal disease due to these viruses in humans, an- imals or birds. It is presumed that WNV is being introduced annually from warmer coun- tries such as Africa by migratory birds that in part overfly and, in part, reproduce in the re- gions where this study was carried out. Ac- cording to the sentinel chicken survey, efficient virus transmission between, or to chickens, ap- pears to commence in late spring and contin- ues during the summer period. Whilst the pres- ence of mosquitoes such as Aedes spp, Anopheles spp. Culex spp, Coquillettidia spp and Culiseta spp. is recognized in this part of Italy (Ferrarese 1994), the high efficiency with which the virus appears to be transmitted to the chicken pop- ulation, suggests that mechanisms additional to arthropod transmission, such as fecal and/or oral transmission (Banet-Noach et al. 2003, Ko- mar et al. 2003), could contribute significantly to transmission efficiency. In addition, non- viremic transmission which was recently demonstrated in controlled laboratory experi- ments with WNV-infected mosquitoes (Higgs WNV DETECTED IN NORTHERN ITALY IN SENTINEL CHICKENS 415 4 - May 18 - May 31 - May 14 - Jun 28 - Jun 12 - Jul 26 - Jul Date 0 10N um be r of s er oc on ve rs io ns 20 30 40 50 FIG. 2.

F or p er so na l u se o nl y. et al. 2005), might also increase the efficiency of WNV transmission. An obvious question arises from these sen- tinel experiments: Why is there no disease in animals and birds in Northern Italy? First, one possibility is that the strains of WNV that cir- culate silently in western Europe are naturally sylvatic in Africa; that is, these viruses might correspond to the lineage II clade of viruses de- fined by Lanciotti et al. (1999). Second, these sylvatic viruses are not considered to be highly virulent for mammalian species, presumably because they have evolved with vertebrate species over a long period of time in Africa. Third, the low virulence could reflect genetic resistance that has evolved in European species as the viruses have been introduced annually from Africa. Fourth, mosquito density and/or vector competence may rarely reach suffi- ciently high levels amongst human populations in northern Italy, and presumably other more northerly parts of western Europe, to effect an epidemic outbreak of WN fever or encephali- tis. It is believed that the epidemics in Roma- nia in 1996 and in Russia during the beginning of the new millenium arose largely because of the climatic conditions that ensured high mos- quito densities and high virus transmission ef- ficiency (Roehrig et al. 2002). In conclusion, this preliminary investigation indicates that WNV or a very closely related virus is introduced into northern Italy, pre- sumably annually, by migratory birds from Africa under a variety of different ecological conditions that characterise the alpine envi- ronment, ie ranging from the lower, warmer and wetter valleys to higher altitudes where the density of potential vector mosquitoes is ex- pected to be lower. The gradually increasing antibody titers and proportions of positive sen- tinel chickens through the summer months im- ply that, once introduced into a region, the virus is then able to circulate efficiently amongst the resident populations. Our obser- vations support and extend the findings of oth- ers that, although mosquitoes are known to be important vectors in disease transmission, other modes of transmission such as fecal, oral, and aerosol may also be important in the trans- mission of WNV (Nir et al. 1965, Komar et al. 2003). Discrimination between these different transmission routes could be addressed in fu- ture studies using sentinel chickens in individ- ually fenced open areas to avoid chick-to-chick infection. Clearly, we now need to understand why in most cases WNV can disperse very successfully without causing overt disease, but on other oc- casions its introduction to a region can lead to major epidemic outbreaks.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length E gene sequences obtained for 30 Brazilian SLEV strains was performed using different methods including Bayesian and relaxed molecular clock approaches. A new genetic lineage was suggested, hereafter named genotype VIII, which co-circulates with the previously described genotype V in the Brazilian Amazon region. Genotypes II and III were restricted to São Paulo state (South-east Atlantic rainforest ecosystem). The analysis also suggested the emergence of an SLEV common ancestor between 1875 and 1973 (mean of 107 years ago), giving rise to two major genetic groups: genotype II, more prevalent in the North America, and a second group comprising the other genotypes (I and III–VIII), broadly dispersed throughout the Americas, suggesting that SLEV initially emerged in South America and spread to North America. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the high genetic variability of SLEV and its geographical dispersion in Brazil and other New World countries. INTRODUCTION Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is an encephalito- genic arbovirus with a primary life cycle associated with Culex mosquitoes and wild birds (Travassos da Rosa et al., 1997; Vasconcelos et al., 1998; Reisen, 2003). Taxonom- ically, Saint Louis encephalitis virus is a recognized species of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) group, which includes other important human pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV), JEV and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (Calisher & Gould, 2003). SLEV is widely distributed throughout the western hemi- sphere from Canada to Argentina. SLEV was first isolated in 1933 during a major epidemic that occurred in St Louis, Missouri, USA, with more than 1000 encephalitis cases reported. Outbreaks or clusters of encephalitis cases associated with SLEV have been reported annually in the USA (Reisen, 2003). Usually, the fatality rate ranges from 5 to 20 % (Tsai & Mitchell, 1988), with higher mortality rates observed among the elderly (.75 years of age) (Reisen, 2003). The low number of human cases reported in tropical regions of the Americas may reflect inadequate laboratory diagnosis, circulation of less virulent virus strains and/or enzootic cycles involving mosquitoes that are not typically anthropophilic (Spense, 1980). Only three SLEV strains have been isolated from humans in Brazil. Two patients resident in Para state had clinical manifestations char- acterized by fever and jaundice (Pinheiro et al., 1981; Vasconcelos et al., 1998), whilst one from São Paulo was suspected of dengue-like disease (Rocco et al., 2005). None of them had neurological symptoms. Recently, the SLEV genome was detected by RT-PCR in four patients with clinical symptoms similar to those observed in dengue fever, as well as in two other patients clinically diagnosed as presenting with viral meningoencephalitis, in the muni- cipality of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, south-eastern Brazil (Mondini et al., 2007a, b). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the SLEV E gene sequences determined in this study are GU808530–GU808559. Details of the SLEV strains included in the phylogenetic analysis are available with the online version of this paper. Journal of General Virology (2010), 91, 2420–2427 DOI 10.1099/vir.0.019117-0 2420 019117 G 2010 SGM Printed in Great Britain Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:53:43 In Brazil, several SLEV strains have been obtained from wild birds, especially from those belonging to the family Formicariidae (Dégallier et al., 1992), and also from Culex mosquitoes. Furthermore, many strains have been isolated from Culex declarator and Culex coronator mosquitoes, both predominantly ornithophilic but also able to infect primates and considered potential SLEV vectors in the Brazilian Amazon (Travassos da Rosa et al., 1985; Hervé et al., 1986; Vasconcelos et al., 1991). Other potential vectors, including species belonging to the genera Aedes, Mansonia and Sabethes, can become infected and transmit SLEV to other vertebrate hosts. Thus, secondary cycles certainly exist on different forest levels, resulting in the participation of other animals in the cycle, including rodents and marsupials on the ground and non- human primates in the canopy (Hervé et al., 1986). Moreover, a serological survey performed on equines from the Brazilian Amazon and Pantanal areas revealed a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (50.9 %) to SLEV (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Previous phylogenetic studies based on complete nucleo- tide sequences of the envelope gene (E) (Kramer & Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003; May et al., 2008; Auguste et al., 2009; Ottendorfer et al., 2009) and the ORF (10 236 nt) (Baillie et al., 2008) of SLEV strains have revealed the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas. However, there is no consensus in terms of number of SLEV genetic lineages and sublineages. Most SLEV strains have been grouped geographically (Kramer & Chandler, 2001), suggesting that SLEV is pre- dominantly maintained in a particular area. However, some strains have occasionally been transported between areas within and outside the USA (Kramer et al., 1997; Kramer & Chandler, 2001). There is no evidence of a correlation between phylogenetic grouping (based on the nucleotide sequence of the E gene) and phenotypic characteristics (such as virulence) (Kramer et al., 1997). In those analyses, the SLEV strains from the Brazilian Amazon were classified as genotype V (subgenotypes VA and VB), whilst isolates from south-eastern Brazil (São Paulo state) were classified as genotypes II and III. In this study, we examined the molecular epidemiology of SLEV, including the genetic diversity and dispersal of SLEV, through phylogenetic analysis based on the complete nucleotide sequence of the E gene of 30 SLEV strains isolated in the Brazilian Amazon that had not previously been studied. RESULTS The nucleotide sequence divergence between groups was assessed and determined as 6.3±0.4 % (mean±SD). The mean within-group genetic divergence was estimated at 4 % ranging from 3.2 % for genotype II to 4.7 % for genotype IV, and the confidence value (CV) was determined as 5.1 %. Phylogenetic trees constructed by neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum-parsimony (MP), maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods revealed similar topologies. All methods generated trees with a similar topology; thus, we used the ML and Bayesian reconstructions, which presented higher bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability values, respectively, to represent the final topology. The phylogeny depicted all SLEV strains divided into eight phylogenetic groups: groups I–VII corresponding to previously described genotypes (Kramer & Chandler, 2001) and a distinct group, hereafter designated genotype VIII. Phylogenetic groups were determined using the association of bootstrap (.75 %), posterior probability (.0.9) and CV (5.1 %) as the criteria established for group inclusion or exclusion. Fourteen out of 37 strains (37.8 %) isolated in the Brazilian Amazon region were identified as genotype VIII, and 23 (62.2 %) as genotype V (Fig. 1). Seven strains isolated in Pará state were classified as subgenotype VIIIA. One strain isolated in Mato Grosso state was classified as subgenotype VIIIB together with six other isolates from Pará state (Fig. 1). For genotype V, nine isolates (eight from Pará state and one from Rondônia) were grouped in the VA subgenotype, whilst seven isolates from Pará were included in the VB subgenotype. To investigate the divergence time among SLEV strains in the Americas, we used a time-scaled analysis based on evolutionary rates estimated using the Bayesian coalescent method (Fig. 1). The nucleotide substitution rate for all analysed strains ranged from 3.961024 to 7.761024 substitutions per site per year (mean of 4.961024 substitutions per site per year). The time of emergence of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for SLEV in the Americas [(expressed as the 95 % highest posterior density (HPD)] was estimated to have occurred between 1875 and 1973 (mean 1898). For genotype II, a common parental virus emerged between 1898 and 1930 (mean 1920). For the group including genotypes I and III–VIII, a common virus ancestor emerged between 1893 and 1942 (mean 1915). The time of emergence for each genotype was estimated as follows: genotype I, between 1924 and 1951 (mean 1932); genotype V between 1944 and 1952 (mean 1948); genotype VIII, between 1956 and 1966 (mean 1959); genotype VI between 1946 and 1969 (mean 1949); genotype VII between 1962 and 1965 (mean 1964); genotype IV between 1962 and 1968 (mean 1966); and genotype III between 1967 and 1979 (mean 1971) (Fig. 1). DISCUSSION Previous studies on comparative phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas (Kramer & Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003; Baillie et al., 2008; May et al., 2008; Auguste et al., 2009; Ottendorfer et al., 2009), but there is disagreement among authors regarding the classification of certain strains into lineages and sublineages.

Rodrigues and others 2422 Journal of General Virology 91 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:53:43 Our comparative and chronological phylogenetic analysis carried out using full-length E gene sequences for 133 SLEV strains, 30 of them sequenced in this study, identified the presence of the seven genotypes reported by Kramer & Chandler (2001), as well as 14 strains within a new genotype, designated genotype VIII (Fig. 1). The results obtained by the molecular clock analysis suggested that SLEV is a relatively new flavivirus in comparison with other flaviviruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus (Zanotto et al., 1995, 1996; Bryant et al., 2007), as its evolutionary history was dated between 1875 and 1973 (mean 1898). The analysis conducted by Auguste et al. (2009), which included 73 SLEV strains, indicated SLEV dispersal from South America towards North America and is in agreement with the current chronological analysis of the 133 SLEVs performed in this study (Fig. 1). In fact, the current analysis suggests evolutionary events that occurred almost simultaneously in both hemispheres (North America: 77–108 years ago; South America: 72–121 years ago) through the introduction of a given progenitor (geno- type common ancestor), leading to the emergence and geographical dispersal of distinct phylogenetic lineages in North and South America along the time line. These two ancestral groups are mainly represented by: (i) genotype II, which was almost entirely restricted to North America and included the strains isolated during major SLEV epidemics in North America between 1933 and 2003; and (ii) the other genotypes I and III–VIII, which were more widely distributed and responsible for outbreaks, epizootics and/or enzootic transmission during the same period of time in various countries in South America (Argentina, Brazil and Peru), Central America (Guatemala and Panama) and the Caribbean (Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago), as well as in the USA (Fig. 1). Genotypes V and VIII were more prevalent in Brazil and, according to the analysis using the relaxed molecular clock method, these genotypes evolved from a common ancestor between 1937 and 1950, segregating with time into two distinct subgenotypes that emerged in almost the same period (Fig. 1). High Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPPs) support the designation of SLEV genotype VIII (1.0), as well as the subgenotypes VIIIA (0.97) and VIIIB (0.92). The genotype VIII phylogenetic group was also supported by its within-group genetic divergence (3.9 %), which was less than the CV (5.1 %) used as a criterion for group inclusion or exclusion (Fig. 1). Genotype VIII was restricted to the Pará state in the northern Amazon region, whilst genotype V was widely distributed in the Americas, with strains isolated in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago, which were grouped in subgenotype VA, and USA strains, which were grouped in subgenotype VB. Based on our analysis, the MRCA for subgenotype VA emerged between 1948 and 1955 (mean 1953) and is more closely related to a Trinidad and Tobago strain, following a dispersion pattern in the Brazilian Amazon from east to west in different muni- cipalities of Pará (Altamira, Belém, Faro, Itaituba, Medicilândia, Oriximiná, Santarém and Tucurui) and the Rondônia states (Jamari) (Fig. 2). The prevalence of subgenotype VA in the 1980s was higher than that observed for subgenotype VB, being subsequently detected over the time in Tucuruı́ (1990) and Medicilândia (2002) in Pará state (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the SLEV strains from Cali- fornia (1998–2001) and Texas (2002) identified as geno- type V were closely related to the strain from Medicilândia isolated in 2002 (BRA-02) (Fig. 1), suggesting an intense traffic of SLEV through the two American subcontinents, probably by migratory birds. SLEV strains identified as genotype VB were isolated in the 1960s and 1970s from wild birds and mosquitoes or sentinel animals at a surveillance site for arboviruses placed in a forested area near Belém, the capital of Pará state (Table 1, Fig. 2). The circulation of SLEV in the 1970s was associated with isolation of the BRA-78 strain from a patient resident in Belém, although epidemiological investigations in the workplace and residence of the patient revealed no evidence of extensive SLEV transmission (Pinheiro et al., 1981). The subgenotype VB was also isolated in the north-eastern and southern regions of Pará, respectively, in the municipalities of Ipixuna (1960), Itaituba (1971, 1973) and Marabá (1984) (Table 1, Fig. 2). The phylogenetic analysis suggested a broad distribution of SLEV genotype VIII in the Amazon (Fig. 2). Genotype VIII represented 41.7 % (n55) and 61.5 % (n58) of the Amazonian isolates from the 1970s (n512) and 1980s (n513), respectively. Subgenotype VIIIA was already detected in Brazil in 1964, as demonstrated by strain BRA-64B. Furthermore, strains were also detected in 1984 in different municipalities from distinct geographical Fig. 1.

In the surveillance site neighbouring Belém, the subgeno- types VA, VB, VIIIA and VIIIB were also detected. The VIIIA and VIIIB subgenotypes were identified until 1984 (Figs 1 and 2); however, it was not possible to conclude whether there is current circulation of these subgenotypes in the Brazilian Amazon due to the small numbers of SLEV strains isolated in the years following those included in the analysis. The two SLEV strains isolated in São Paulo state, south- eastern Brazil, were distinct from those from the Brazilian Amazon region, with one strain (BRA-68) identified as a member of genotype II and the other (BRA-04) a member of genotype III (Santos et al., 2006). The BRA-04 strain was isolated from a patient with clinical symptoms suggestive of dengue fever (Rocco et al., 2005) and was genetically related to SLEV strains isolated from Culex quinquefascia- tus mosquitoes during a SLEV outbreak in 2005 in Córdoba, Argentina (Diaz et al., 2006; May et al., 2008). Based on the time-scaled analysis, our results suggested that SLEV genotype II was the first to emerge in the Americas between 1898 and 1930, followed, in order, by genotypes I, VI, VIII, IV, VII, III and V within a period of 42 years between 1936 and 1978. In conclusion, this study identified a new genetic lineage of SLEV (genotype VIII) and demonstrated that genotypes V and VIII are largely distributed in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas genotypes II and III are genetic lineages that circulate in an area restricted to the south-east Atlantic Forest system (state of São Paulo).

METHODS Viral samples. Thirty low-passage-number SLEV strains were obtained from the reference arbovirus collection at the Department of Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fevers, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Brazil, isolated between 1964 and 2002 in the states of Pará (n528), Rondônia (n51) and Mato Grosso (n51) (Table 1). The viral strains were obtained primarily from infected newborn mice brains. The lyophilized strains were rehydrated and recovered after a single passage in Vero cells. RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of infected Vero cells exhibiting approximately 75 % cytopathic effect. RNA extractions were performed using the Trizol LS method (Gibco Life Sciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR. The SLEV full-length E gene was amplified by RT-PCR using three sets of primers specific to the E region (F880/B1629, F1390/C207 and F1990/B2586; Kramer & Chandler, 2001). Amplicons were purified using a PureLink Quick Gel Extraction kit (Invitrogen) and the cDNA was sequenced directly using the dideoxyribonucleo- tide chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) in an automated capillary sequencer (ABI 3130; Applied Biosystems) using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems). Amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the same primers as for the RT-PCRs. Assembly and sequence analysis. The obtained sequences were first analysed for quality and then assembled into a single contig using the SeqMan v5.0 program (LaserGene; DNAStar). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTAL_X software to determine the genetic divergence among the studied strains. The genetic divergence within and between groups was assessed using MEGA v4.0 software (Kumar et al., 2008) and used to estimate a CV to define the phylogenetic grouping. The CV was determined as described previously (Medeiros et al., 2007) as the mean of genetic divergence within and between groups based on well-established SLEV genotypes (genotypes I–VII). Viruses were grouped when the genetic divergence within a given group was less than the CV; strains were excluded from a given group if the value for the genetic divergence within the group was greater than or equal to the CV.

St Louis encephalitis virus: divergence and dispersal http://vir.sgmjournals.org 2425 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.1.116 On: Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:53:43 Phylogenetic analysis and evolution. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the entire E gene sequences obtained for the 30 Brazilian SLEV strains with sequences of homologous regions from 103 other SLEV strains (see Supplementary Table S1, available in JGV Online) available in GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the NJ (Saitou & Nei, 1987), ML and MP methods using PAUP v4.0 software (Swofford, 1999). The Modeltest v3.6 program (Posada & Crandall, 1998) was used to determine the best nucleotide substitution model to be used according to the Akaike information criteria. For the NJ method, a distance matrix was calculated using the aligned sequences using the Tamura three-parameter and gamma distribution (gamma distri- bution parameter51). For the MP method, a 4 : 1 transition : trans- version ratio was used. Bootstrap replication (2000 replicates) was applied to give confidence on phylogenetic grouping (Felsenstein, 1985). WNV strain NY99 (GenBank accession no. DQ211652) was used as an outgroup to root the trees. Phylogenetic groups were defined using the highest bootstrap or BPP values over each main node in combination with the criteria for group inclusion or exclusion using the CV as reference. The nucleotide substitution model selected by Modeltest was also used to estimate trees using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches implemented in MrBayes and BEAST (Drummond et al., 2003). In this case, the final tree presented was the maximum clade credibility tree estimated in BEAST with a chain length of 175 million, sampling every 1000. The BPP was estimated from the data obtained for 50 % of the generated consensus trees (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001). The TRACER program (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) was used to inspect whether MrBayes reached the appropriated conver- gence. Nucleotide substitution rates and the age of the MRCA were estimated for the whole dataset using models that allowed for rate variation among lineages under a relaxed (uncorrelated exponential) molecular clock (Drummond et al., 2006) performed in BEAST where tip times corresponded to the year of virus sampling (Drummond et al., 2003). Bootstrap values less than 75 % and a BPP less than 0.9 were not represented in the final tree. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Brendan Flannery for his critical review of the manuscript.

Root-2013-West Nile virus associations in wild.pdf	"BRIEF REVIEW West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis J. Jeffrey Root Received: 20 June 2012 / Accepted: 15 September 2012 / Published online: 2 December 2012 � Springer-Verlag (outside the USA) 2012 Abstract Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveil- lance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized. Introduction The first isolation of West Nile virus (WNV; family Fla- viviridae, genus Flavivirus) was documented in Omogo in the West Nile District of Uganda from an adult woman [103]. Subsequently, the virus has been described to be widely distributed in parts the Old World, such as Africa, the Middle East, Asia, southern Europe, and elsewhere [114]. During the summer of 1999, WNV was first detected in the Western Hemisphere in the northeastern U.S. [80]. The virus spread rapidly across the continental U.S. [69] and expanded its range north into Canada by 2001 [24] and southwardly into the Caribbean basin and Mexico between 2001 and 2002 [52]. The virus is thought to have reached the South American continent by 2004 [52]. Although WNV activity is strictly limited to lineage 1 viruses in the New World, lineage 2 viruses occur in various parts of the Old World [5, 78], and additional lineages have been proposed [78]. The natural enzootic cycle of WNV is thought to occur largely among birds and mosquito vectors [56]. Mammals have generally been presumed to be dead-end hosts because they typically produce short-duration viremia that is below the threshold for infecting most mosquito species [7]. For example, horses are known to be commonly exposed to WNV, which can be associated with morbidity and mortality; however, their low viremia of short duration during experimental infections suggest that they are unli- kely amplifying hosts [12]. Nonetheless, many reports have suggested that several species of wild mammals are com- monly exposed to WNV, occasionally with high associated seroprevalence rates. Some recent experimental studies have documented viremia of [ 105.0 pfu/mL in select species of mammals. This level has been commonly used as a threshold suggesting that a minimum level is required to infect select mosquito species through blood meals [51]. Overall, the general consensus on the trivial roles mammals play in the epidemiology of WNV may be due to a lack of inquiry rather than a lack of importance [66]. The objective of this paper was to provide a compre- hensive review of WNV activity in wild mammals. In J. Jeffrey Root (&) US Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center, 4101 La Porte Ave, Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA e-mail: jeff.root@aphis.usda.gov 123 Arch Virol (2013) 158:735–752 DOI 10.1007/s00705-012-1516-3 addition, the potential roles of wild mammals in the ecol- ogy of WNV are discussed. Due to space limitations, Kunjin virus and the Australian continent are not focused on in this paper. For the purposes of this review, natural exposures to WNV are defined as detections of antibodies, virus, viral RNA, or other forms of detection. When suit- able/possible, common and scientific names have been updated to reflect modern taxonomy following Mammal Species of the World [112]. As reviewed elsewhere, caution must be used when interpreting serologic results from locations where multiple group B arboviruses exist [38]. Many of the older studies cited in this paper used a single assay for antibody detection, some of which are prone to cross-react with other flaviviruses. As such, some antibody detections reviewed in this paper are presented for com- pleteness, but it is acknowledged that some of these reports could represent false positive cross-reactivity. Natural exposures of wild mammals to West Nile virus The data presented below represent a synthesis of natural exposures of wild mammals to WNV. For the sake of completeness, reports associated with captive wildlife are also presented in key situations, as zoos and similar facil- ities have been proposed as potential sentinel sites for emerging pathogens [61]. WNV in rodents WNV exposures have been detected in diverse wild rodent species from multiple regions. Rodents represent a taxo- nomic group with one of the highest number of reported species exposed. Some of the earliest observations of WNV exposures in wild mammals were obtained from rodents during the 1960s. Many of the tests used for rodent anti- body assessments, especially older accounts, are prone to cross-reactivity and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution. A summary of natural WNV exposures of rodents is presented in Table 1. Squirrels Dead and sick tree squirrels have become ubiquitous signs of WNV activity in some regions of the U.S. [39, 50, 76]. Exposures have been detected in fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) [8, 39, 50, 76, 91–93], eastern gray squirrels (Sciu- rus carolinensis) [21, 33, 39, 55, 91], western gray squir- rels (Sciurus griseus) [76], and a red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) [91]. Some of these exposures have been detected in dead or moribund squirrels, while many others have come from healthy squirrels that have developed antibodies to WNV following their exposures. High antibody prevalence rates of nearly 50 % have been reported for fox squirrels and eastern gray squirrels [91]. Additional WNV infections have been reported from ‘‘squirrels’’ in Arizona, Kansas, and Wyoming [70, 71]. However, the species identifications were not presented for these animals. Overall, WNV exposures in tree squirrels have been presented from at least thirteen states and the District of Columbia in the contiguous U.S. Additional WNV exposures from a non-tree squirrel comes from the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), in which antibodies were detected in nine specimens from Austria [102]. The reasons why tree squirrels appear to be more commonly exposed to WNV when compared to other sympatric mammal species is undetermined; however, aspects of their behavioral ecology have been suggested to increase their chance of exposure to mosquito vectors [91]. For example, the activity and feeding behavior of Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes in tree canopies in Tennessee [96] suggest potential increased exposure to tree squirrels. Tree squirrels have been proposed as useful tools for monitoring WNV activity [76, 91], as these animals pro- vide localized evidence of WNV activity [76]. However, when antibodies are used to monitor WNV activity, the age structure of populations will need to be accounted for [91], young animals will need to be utilized [33], or a longitu- dinal approach, such as mark-recapture sampling, may be required [93] to overcome bias generated by studying animals potentially exposed during previous years. Chipmunks WNV exposures have been documented in eastern chip- munks (Tamias striatus) on two occasions in New York and Maryland, USA [33, 63]. However, a multi-state study including New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio failed to detect WNV antibodies in any of the [ 30 eastern chip- munks sampled [91]. It has been suggested that limited mosquito exposures or the potential for lethal WNV infections in eastern chipmunks may account for the low seroprevalence observed in this species [33]. Due to their small size, dead chipmunks are less likely to be recovered during surveillance efforts when compared to larger tree squirrels. Rats Exposures of WNV to Old World rat species are fairly diverse, with many exposures detected in Rattus spp. For example, antibodies to WNV were detected in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and/or roof rats (R. rattus) in Pakistan, Israel, Austria, Tunisia, central Africa, and Madagascar [2, 13, 16, 19, 30, 37, 102], from R. rattus alexandrius in 736 J.

In addition, virus has been isolated from African arv- icanthis (aka grass rat; Arvicanthis niloticus) collected from a Sudan woodland vegetative zone in Nigeria [49], and exposures have been detected in the common metad (Millardia meltada), also known as the soft-furred rat, collected in Pakistan [19]. A serosurvey in Kenya detected WNV antibodies in African arvicanthis, common dasymys (Dasymys incomtus), Kaiser’s aethomys (Aethomys kai- seri), a rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sika- pusi), and a black-tailed thallomys (Thallomys nigricauda); however, sera were generally insufficient to conduct con- firmatory tests for these species [43]. In the New World, exposures have been primarily limited to Old World rat species of the genus Rattus, with antibodies detected in brown rats from Maryland and Washington DC [33], roof rats from Louisiana [21], and Rattus species from Louisiana [91]. In addition, antibody-positive hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) were sampled in Louisiana [21]. Mice Reported exposures of Old World mice to WNV are lim- ited. WNV antibody detections have been reported in the western Mediterranean mouse (Mus spretus) in Spain [14] and Morocco [15], in a field mouse (Apodemus sp.) from Austria [102], and in a long-tailed field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), Maghreb garden dormice (Eliomys munby- anus), and unidentified Mus sp. in Tunisia [13], in a northeast African spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) and an eastern spiny mouse (Acomys dimidiatus) from Egypt [1, 99], and in unidentified praomys (Praomys sp.) from central Africa [16].

The authors concluded that the small number of rodents with antibodies and the low HI titers are insignificant h Reported in original paper as Eliomys tunetae 738 J. Jeffrey Root 123 [53]. Similar to the Old World, reported WNV exposures of mice found in the New World are limited. Antibodies to WNV have been detected in Peromyscus spp. in the eastern U.S., house mice in the central and eastern U.S., and a meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) in the eastern U.S. [33, 91]. Other rodents Additional WNV exposures, mostly in the Old World, have been occasionally documented in other rodent species. These included WNV exposures in an Indian gerbil (Tatera indica) and Indian desert jird (Meriones hurrianae) from Pakistan [19], a bushy-tailed jird (Sekeetamys calurus) and a Wagner’s dipodil (Dipodillus dasyurus) from Egypt [99], a greater Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum) and Guenther’s vole (Microtus guentheri) from Israel [2], a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and ‘‘rodents’’ from Hungary [72, 73], additional bank voles from Italy and Austria [59, 102], and from a common vole (Microtus arvalis) collected in Romania [25]. In addition, WNV antibodies have been detected in the sera of common hamsters (Cricetus crice- tus) from Austria [102], and in a common gundi (Cteno- dactylus gundi) and an unidentified gerbil (Gerbillus sp.) from Tunisia [13]. Additional rodent WNV exposures were reported in a woodchuck (Marmota monax) sampled in Maryland [33] and in ‘‘rodents’’ from New York [68]. Overall, only limited testing of rodents for WNV has been conducted, particularly in the New World, when compared to birds and domestic animals. WNV in wild carnivores and mesocarnivores Detections of WNV antibodies in wild carnivores and mesocarnivores have become fairly common over the last decade in North America. Some species have been afflicted with severe disease, primarily in captive situations, fol- lowing WNV infection, while disease in other species has not been routinely reported. The potential roles of various peridomestic mesocarnivores in WNV amplification cycles have been proposed as important questions [23], likely due to the additional public-health burden these species could foster if they are reservoir competent. Further, mesopre- dators have been proposed as potentially useful sentinels for monitoring WNV activity in delineated areas [6]. A summary of natural WNV exposures of carnivores and mesocarnivores is presented in Table 2. Striped skunks The first detection of WNV exposure in a striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) was reported from Connecticut [63]. Additional exposures were reported in this species sampled in Wyoming, with a high antibody prevalence rate of 63 % [6], thereby suggesting that striped skunks are commonly exposed to WNV in this area. An additional 90 striped skunk sera tested from Arizona, California, Louisiana, and Texas did not yield evidence of WNV antibodies [6]. Canids Only limited WNV exposures have been detected in wild canids, although this may be due to lack of sampling rather than a lack of exposures. Antibodies to WNV have been detected in coyotes (Canis latrans) during two different studies in Wisconsin, with an antibody prevalence rate of 27 % during a 2003-2004 sampling period [22], 0 % during a 2004-2005 sampling period, and increasing to 10 % during a 2005-2006 sampling period [23]. An additional example of a canid exposed to WNV comes from the red fox (Vulpes vul- pes), as a single red fox was documented to be antibody positive in Wisconsin [22]. Other wild canids, such as the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), have been tested for WNV exposure but none were found to have been exposed [6]. Raccoons Raccoons (Procyon lotor) have been commonly shown to be exposed to WNV in many regions of the U.S. Feral populations in the Old World may have a similar fate. Raccoon infections with WNV were first reported from New York during 2000 [68]. Subsequently, antibody detections in raccoons were reported in 2005 from Penn- sylvania [91] and Louisiana [21]. Additional antibody detections have been documented in raccoons from Wis- consin, Louisiana, Wyoming, Maryland, Washington DC, and Iowa [6, 8, 22, 23, 33]. Bears Antibodies to WNV have been documented from a small percentage of American black bear (Ursus americanus) sera collected from New Jersey [27]. In addition, WNV antibodies have been detected in brown bear (Ursus arctos) sera collected from Croatia [62]. Virginia opossum The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is a marsu- pial and is therefore not a member of the mammalian order Carnivora. However, it is considered a North American mesocarnivore. Virginia opossums have exhibited wide- spread WNV exposures. Antibodies to WNV have been detected in this species from New York, Ohio, Pennsyl- vania, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Texas, Wyoming, Maryland, Washington DC, and Iowa [6, 8, 21–23, 33, 91]. The West Nile virus associations in wild mammals 739 123 peridomestic nature of this species in some situations may make it a useful species for monitoring WNV activity. Other carnivores Antibodies to WNV have been detected in an unidentified civet from Ethiopia [3]. This appears to be one of the first published accounts of WNV exposure in a wild carnivore. WNV in other wild mammalian species Several additional wild mammalian species have shown evidence of WNV exposure. Some of these represent a single example or a few examples of exposures in a par- ticular taxonomic group. A summary of natural WNV exposures in these species is presented in Tables 3, 4, 5. Chiropterans Reports of WNV infections in chiropterans have been widely documented in the New and Old Worlds. Evidence of WNV exposure has been reported in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) from New York and Illinois [11, 55, 63], in the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in New York, Maryland, and New Jersey [33, 55, 63, 81], a northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) sampled in New Jersey [81], and in Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasilien- sis) collected in Louisiana [20]. In the Old World, anti- bodies were detected in Egyptian rousettes (Rousettus aegyptiacus) from Israel and Uganda [2, 101], unidentified rousette(s) (Rousettus sp.) from central Africa [16], mala- gasy flying foxes (Pteropus rufus) from Madagascar [30], Angolan soft-furred fruit bats (Lissonycteris angolensis) collected in Kenya [101], dusky pipistrelles (Pipistrellus hesperidus) from Tunisia [13], and unidentified free-tailed bats (Tadarida sp.) from central Africa [16]. Antibodies to WNV were described from three additional bat species in Uganda, which included little free-tailed bats (Chaerephon pumilus), Angola free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus), and a single African straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) [98, 101]. Further, WNV was isolated from a Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultii) in India [79]. Additional WNV exposure accounts comes from unidentified ‘‘bats’’ Table 2 Natural exposures of wild and zoo members of the order Carnivora to West Nile virus * = animal living in a zoo or captive outdoor animal facility a Reported in original paper as Panthera uncia b Scientific names were not listed in the original document.

Jeffrey Root 123 in New York, Wisconsin, India, Egypt, central Africa, and Ethiopia [3, 16, 46, 68, 70, 106]. The antibody detection in four of 48 unidentified bats from Egypt [106] appears to be one of the first published accounts of WNV exposure in a wild mammal. Soricomorphs The literature on WNV in soricomorphs is scant. However, antibodies were detected in Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) from India [47], white-toothed house shrews (Crocidura russula) in Spain [14], and a Zaphir’s shrew (Crocidura zaphiri) in Ethiopia [3]. Several African giant shrews (Crocidura olivieri), described in the original paper as C. occidentalis, had antibodies reactive with WNV; however, sera were generally insufficient to conduct con- firmatory tests on this species [43]. Additional accounts of WNV antibodies in unidentified shrews (Crocidura sp.) were described in central Africa [16]. Antibodies reactive with WNV in a non-shrew member of the order Sorico- morpha, the Roman mole (Talpa romana), have been reported from Italy [59]. Other workers have unsuccess- fully attempted to detect WNV antibodies in shrew sera from the New World [91]. Lagomorphs Detections of WNV antibodies have been published for lagomorph species, primarily in the Old World, with detections occurring in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in France [58] and presumably in Austria (e.g., Oryctolagus sp.) [102]. WNV antibodies have been reported in European hares (Lepus syriacus), presumably now considered to be Lepus europaeus, from Israel [2] and from the Czech Republic [44, 45]. An unidentified rabbit and hare yielded evidence of WNV antibodies in Greece [54], and WNV infections were confirmed in three unidentified rabbits from New York [68]. In addition, a black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) in California tested positive for WNV [76]. Artiodactylids West Nile virus activity has been detected in a variety of artiodactylids. In the U.S., WNV exposures have been reported in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in many regions, with antibodies detected in New Jersey and Iowa [28, 95], and viral RNA detected in Georgia from a three-year-old male with a history of signs of disease, such Table 3 Natural exposures of bats to West Nile virus a Reported in original paper as Russettus aegypticus [2] b Reported in original paper as Rousettus leschenaulti c Reported in original paper as Tadarida pumila and Tadarida condylura d Reported in original paper as Pipistrellus kuhli.

Thus, deer have been proposed as a useful serosurveillance animal for monitoring WNV activity [95]. A greater number of artiodactylid species with WNV exposures have been reported from the Old World. For example, WNV antibodies have been detected in European roe (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and red sheep (Ovis aries) hunted in Moravia, Czech Republic [44, 45]. In addition, a dated account of antibodies in an unidentified ‘‘antelope’’ in central Africa was published over four decades ago [16]. Antibodies have been detected in wild boar/feral swine (Sus scrofa) in both hemispheres. These exposures were documented in Florida, Georgia, and Texas in the U.S. [32], and in Moravia in the Czech Republic [36, 44, 45]. Perrissodactylaids Antibodies to WNV have been detected in sera from feral horses (Equus caballus) from Nevada during the last dec- ade, with nearly 1,400 horses sampled during the multi- year study period [31]. A single animal was antibody positive during 2004, but none were positive during 2005-2006 [31]. This trend changed during the latter part of the decade of collection, as during 2008 and 2009, antibody prevalence rates were 19 and 7.2 %, respectively [31]. Nonhuman primates Published accounts of wild nonhuman primate exposures to WNV are uncommon and have been primarily associated with Madagascar. Antibodies were detected in a Milne-Edward’s Table 4 Natural exposures of nonhuman primates to West Nile virus Common name Scientific name Detection type Location Reference Ring-tailed lemur Lemur catta Antibodies Antibodies NY, USA Madagascar [61]* [30, 104] Milne-Edward’s sportive lemur Lepilemur edwardsi Antibodies Madagascar [30, 89] Brown lemur Eulemur fulvusa Antibodies Madagascar [30] Weasel lemur Lepilemur mustelinusb Antibodies Madagascar [30] Verreaux’s sifaka Propithecus verreauxi Antibodies Madagascar [30] Coquerel’s sifaka Propithecus coquereli Antibodies Madagascar [17] Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus Virus isolation, viral RNA, antibodies Toronto, Canada [74]* Baboon Papio cynocephalus anubisc Antibodies Toronto, Canada [74]* Papio spp. Antibodies LA, USA [87]* Japanese macaque Macaca fuscata Antibodies Toronto, Canada [74]* Rhesus monkey Macaca mulatta Antibodies LA, USA [87]* Southern pig-tailed macaque Macaca nemestrina Antibodies Antibodies LA, USA LA, USA [87]* [42]* Common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes Antibodies Antibodies Congo Central Africa [75] [16]** Unidentified monkey Cercopithecus sp.

VANELLA Instituto de Virolog@a, CÃ³rdoba,Argentina, and the BelÃ©mVirus Laboratory, BelÃ©m,Brazil* slaughterhouse. Also included in the study were a small number of human sera collected in 1961 and 1962 at three sitesâ€”La Gallareta, ParanÃ¡ and Corrientesâ€”on the ParanÃ¡River in the Litoral region of northeastern Argentina. MATERIALS AND METHODS The human donors, all apparently healthy, were of both sexes and ranged in age from 4 to 69 years. Wild mammals were generally caught alive in traps and wild birds in mist nets, but occasionally mammals and birds were caught by hand or shot. Bats, rodents, marsupials and wild birds were bled from the heart, domestic birds from the wing vein, cattle, horses and goats from the jugular vein, and rabbits from the marginal ear vein. At the slaughterhouse, animals were bled after death. Bird bloods were collected in heparinized syringes. After separation, all speci mens were stored at â€”15Â°Cuntil tested. Table 2 lists the 24 arboviruses used in this study, their strain numbers and passage levels in newborn mice. All strains were isolated in Brazil: the WEE strain in Rio de Janeiro,2 Itaporanga in SÃ£oPaulo State3 and the rest in the Amazon region by the BelÃ©mVirus Laboratory. BE Ar 7272 virus has been shown by Whitman4 to differ slightly from prototype Cache Valley virus in antigenic properties, but for convenience it will be referred to in this paper as â€œCacheValley.â€• Hernagglutinating antigens were prepared basically by the methods of Clarke and Ca.sals,5 and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were done in plastic plates by a microtechnique de scribed by one of the authors.6 Sera were cx tracted twice with acetone prior to testing. Antigen titers were corrected to 4 units, and serum HI levels of 1:20 or greater on this basis were considered positive. Titers of HI positive sera were determined using 2-fold dilutions. In neutralization (N) tests, infected newborn mouse brain was used as virus source for Bus suquara, Cache Valley and Turlock viruses, and viremic sera of newborn mice for group A and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses. Sera were Epizootics of equine encephalomyelitis, recur ring at intervals of several years, have been described in Argentina since 1919. Some of these are known to have included CÃ³rdoba Province in central Argentina, and during the most recent epizootic, in 1958, the viruses of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)' and western equine enceph alitis (WEE) were isolated in this provrnce from horses. Since the vectors and reservoirs of these viruses in CÃ³rdobaare unknown, and the possible presence of other arboviruses has never been ex plored, a serosurvey by hemagglutination-inhibi tion and neutralization tests was undertaken among human residents and domestic and wild mammals @ndbirds. CÃ³rdoba Province is located in the southern temperate zone, between 29@and 35Â°south lati tude and 62Â°and 66Â°west longitude. The annual median temperature ranges from 17Â°Cin the southeastern portion to 20Â°Cin the northwest. The rainfall pattern is one of wet summers and dry winters; the annual median precipitation is lowest, 200 mm, in the hill area of the northwest and rises to 800 mm in the fertile plains of the southeast. Between June 1962 and June 1963, various localities representative of different ecological zones in the province were sampled (Fig. 1). Table 1 lists the numbers of serum specimens collected by type and locality. Human serum specimens were collected from the rural popula tions at Chancam, Pins, Pocho and Medanito in the northwest; Calera in the foothills along the Rio Primero ; Oncativo and Marcos Ju@rez. Blood specimens from non-human vertebrates (mammals and birds) were collected at Calera; Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming; and Manfredi, the center of an agricul tural grazing zone. In addition, wild birds were captured on a hill near Piquillmn and cattle from various parts of the province were bled at a S The BelÃ©m Virus Laboratory is maintained jointly by the FundaÃ§aoServiÃ§oE8pecial de Sat@de Ptiblica and The Rockefeller Foundation. This study was supported in part by The Rockefeller Foundation. 1073 1074 SABArrINI, SHOPE AND VANELLA test. This single positive was from a 7-year-old boy at Medanito. Three HI negative sera from other Medanith residents (aged 5, 8 and 31 years) failed to protect against 100 LD5, of EEE virus. While there was a greater incidence of group A HI antibody among the sera from mammals and birds, the number of positives was still small. Excluding the results at Manfredi where horses had a history of vaccination with EEE and WEE vaccines, only 34 sera reacted with one or more antigens. These sera came from horses, chickens, cattle and wild birds. In the case of EEE virus, three of 41 sera from unvaccinated horses at Colonia Tirolesa reacted in HI test, two at a titer of 1:20 and one at 1:80. All three sera neutralized at least 10,000 LD@ of virus, while three HI negative horse sera failed to protect against 100 LD@. Only one cattle serum was positive for EEE in both HI test (1 :40) and N test (320 LD@). Three HI negative cattle sera neutralized 800, 200 and 100 LD@.; however, since nonspecific neutralization of EEE virus by cattle sera has been reported,7 these results are not considered conclusive. Table 3 gives the details for the six sera that were positive in HI and/or N test for WEE or AiiM, viruses closely related.8 Horse serum No. 3 is considered positive for WEE with an liii munological cross-reaction with Aura, but the reactions may be due to a double infection. Serum No. 4, from a Furnar-lus rufus, perhaps represents infection with AiiM, although the low dosage used in the N test leaves this a question. The five HI negative sera (two horse, three chicken) included in these N tests failed to neutralize the dosages used. Two of 63 sera from chickens at Colonia Tiro lesa reacted with Mayaro antigen at a titer of 1:20, and one of these neutralized at least 160 LD@of virus. The second HI positive serum was negative in N test, as was the only HI negative serum tested. The other sera HI positive for group A viruses reacted in dilutions of 1:20 or 1:40 and were uniformly negative in N test. Eighteen of these sera reacted with only one antigen: EEE, one Columbina, one Zenaidura and one chicken ; Una, three ZOnOtriCJ&ia,two Zenaidura, one M@thrus bo.dius, one Columbina, one Spinus mageilanieus and one Glaucidium brasilianum; and Pixuna, one Columbina, two cattle and three chickens.

The serum-virus mixtures were incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°Cbefore inoculation into newborn mice. Cache Valley virus was in oculated intracerebrally and all other viruses intraperitoneally. RESULTS All sera were initially screened in HI tests with each antigen, except in the case of Itaporanga where only 50 sera were tested, all from human donors.

Finally, one M. badius, one M. bonariensis and one Pitangus reacted with three antigensâ€”EEE, IJna and Pixuna. In the N test with Una virus, an HI negative serum from a Speotyto cunicularia, the only bird of this species tested, protected five out of six mice inoculated with 320 LD@oof virus. Although Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus has been isolated in Argentina (as cited by Bettinotti and Aguirre'), no serum reacted with Mucambo virus, which is closely related to VEE.@ Group B viruses. Table 4 shows the numbers of sera that reacted with SLE antigen in HI test. Titers of 1 : 160 or higher were seen. All of the human sera that were HI positive for group B were positive for SLE; some of them also reacted with IlhÃ©usor Busauquara antigen or both, but none reacted with yellow fever antigen. The SLE positive sera from mammals and birds also showed broad group B reactivity. In all cases, however, titers for SLE were equal to or greater than those for other group B antigens. Fifty-four of these SLE positives were exam ined in N test with SLE virus only, and 38 neu trali.sed 50 or more LD.o. Of 20 sera HI negative for group B, four neutralized 50 LD@oof SLE virus. Sera positive for SLE in both tests came from human donors in all localities surveyed except Calera and from horses, goats, cattle, chickens, turkeys, ducks and wild birds (Mob thr'us badius, Chboroceryle, Furnarius, Zenaidura and Columbina). Eight sera from chickens and wild birds (M. badius, Columbmnaand Zonotrichia) reacted only with Bussuquara antigen in HI test and were negative in N test against 100 LD@oof virus. Of five HI negative sera tested with Buseuquara in N test, one chicken serum from Colonia Tirolesa was protective. Bunyamwera group viruses. Forty-one of 87 sera from horses reacted in HI test with Cache Valley antigen, 17 at dilutions of 1 :80 or higher. Three of the positive horse sera which had titers of 1:640, 1:160 and 1:80 with Cache Valley also reacted with Guaroa antigen at titers of 1:20 and 1:40. Twelve other seraâ€”sixhuman, two mule, one goat and three cattleâ€”inhibited Cache Valley antigen at dilutions no higher than 1 :80. Table 5 shows locality and titer for the six positive human sera.

Five were again negative but the sixth, from a horse on the same farm at Colonia Tirolesa as the HI positive horse, protected five of six mice inoculated. Other groUp8. Twelve sera reacted with Cara pani, Guam@, Icoaraci, BE H 22511 (Candiri@) or Tacaiuma antigen (Table 7). N testing was not done with these viruses. No serum reacted with Oriboca, Murutucu, Cati@,BE An 46852 (Anhanga) or Itaporanga antigen. DISCUSSION Unexpectedly, little reactivity with EEE and WEE viruses was encountered in this survey. Both HI and neutralizing substance for EEE virus was demonstrated in only five sera (one human, three horse, one cattle) and for WEE in only three sera, all from horses. The other HI positive reactions with these viruses occurred at low titers and are considered nonspecific, a! though they may represent response to a group A agent not included in the study. The greatest numbers of sera reacted with SLE and Cache Valley viruses. These two viruses accounted for all the positive reactions in human sera from the Litoral region. Sera positive for SLE in both HI and N tests came from human donors in all localities except Calera and from horses, cattle, goats, and wild and domestic birds. Added to the serological evidence of SLE activity among residents of Tucum@n, Mendoza and Buenos Aires obtained by Mettler et ob.,â€•' these results indicate a wide dispersal of SLE neutralizing substance in Argentina. Assuming specificity of the neutralization and a short life span of some of the animals involved, these results may also indicate recent virus activity. The excellent correlation of HI and N test positive reactions with Cache Valley virus sug gest.s that this agent or one closely related has been active in CÃ³rdoba Province, involving horses and to a lesser degree man and goats. Of the different ecological zones sampled, Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming, had the highest rate of positivity as well S Viruses with names in parentheses are not yet formally described.

Horses and chickens sampled here accounted for six of the N test positives for EEE and WEE viruses, the only reactors with Turlock virus, and the sole N test positive for Mayaro virus. All horses studied at this location were at least 5 years old and thus could have been infected during the 195S equine encephalomyelitis epizootic or earlier. The fact that no birds were N test l)ositive for EEE and WEE suggests that these viruses may not have 1078 MH4!171N1, 5UO@ hND VAN@I@A been active recently, but lacking sera from younger horse. this point cannot be confirmed, Several domestic and wild birds had HI or neutrallalng substance for Aura, IJna and Pixuna viruses, These results may indicate the presence of one or more additional group A agents In CtSrdobaProvince; on the other hand, since sera were not inactivated, the results may represent the effect of nonspecific, heat-labile neutralizing substance. SUMMARY Serum specimens from human beings (159) and domestic and wild mammals and birds (884) were collected in CÃ´rdoba Province, Argentina, during 1962-1963 and tested in hemagglutina tion-inhibition (HI) and neutralization (N) tests with 24 arboviruses representing groups A, B, C, GuamÃ¡, Bunyamwera, Turlock and Phieboto mus fever plus one ungrouped agent. Included in the study were 54 human sera collected in the Litoral region of northeastern Argentina in 1961 and 1962. There was a high incidence of HI and N test reactors with BE Ar 7272, a Cache Valley-like agent, among human beings, horses and goats, and with St. Louis encephalitis virus among human beings, wild and domestic birds, horses, cattle and goats. A few sera neutralized eastern or western encephalitis, Turlock, Aura, Mayaro or Una virus. Of the different localities sampled, Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming, had the highest rate of positivity and the greatest variety of antibody.

Scherret-2001-The relationships between West N.pdf	"697Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 Emerging Infectious Diseases West Nile Virus Kunjin (KUN) and West Nile (WN) viruses belong to the Japanese encephalitis (JE) antigenic complex of the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (1). The Flavivirus genus comprises >70 antigenically related, positive-stranded RNA viruses (2,3). KUN and WN viruses are maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving mosquito vectors and bird reservoir hosts, with humans and horses believed to be incidental hosts (4,5). Clinical symptoms most commonly associated with infection with KUN and WN viruses include febrile illness or mild encephalitis. WN virus has been associated with fatal cases of acute meningoenceph- alitis and fulminant hepatitis (6). Early cross-neutralization studies with polyclonal antisera raised to single strains of WN and KUN viruses revealed that these viruses shared a close relationship but were antigenically distinct (7-9). This close relationship was also shown genetically by Coia et al. (10), who compared the sequence of the MRM61C KUN isolate with that of a Ugandan strain of WN (WNFCG) (11-13) and showed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity between the two viruses was 82% and 93%, respectively, in the coding region of the genome. Although genetic studies have shown that KUN virus exists in Australia as a single topotype with <2% nucleotide divergence (14,15), Berthet et al. (16) demonstrat- ed that WN viruses were divided into two lineages. Although these comparisons demonstrated a close relationship between the two viruses, further sequence information is needed from additional isolates of both viruses to fully establish their phylogenetic association within the genus. This report describes the results of sequence analyses of 31 Australian KUN isolates; a KUN isolate from Sarawak, Malaysia; and 28 WN isolates from Africa, India, Europe, and New York (Tables 1 and 2). These virus isolates had all been identified as WN or KUN virus by traditional antigenic means. The Koutango (KOU) isolate was also included in this study, as it belongs to the JE serogroup and is closely related to the KUN/ WN group of viruses (9,17). Materials and Methods Virus and Cell Culture Virus strains sequenced in this study are listed with their sources of isolation in Table 1. African green monkey (Vero) cells were grown at 37°C in M199 (Gibco, New York) with 20 mM HEPES (Gibco) and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for growth or 2% FBS for maintenance. Viruses were cultured in Vero cells by inoculating cell monolayers with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Infected cell culture supernatants were harvested when >70% of the cells exhibited cytopathic effect. Infected supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 x g at 4°C for 15 min, and aliquots were stored at -70°C. A line of Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells was cultured in M199 without HEPES and supplemented with FBS for growth or maintenance, as described. The cells were incubated at 28°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Sequencing A single-step RT-PCR procedure (22) was performed on each virus isolate.

However, genetic and antigenic studies on isolates of these two viruses indicate that the relationship between them is more complex. To better define this relationship, we performed sequence analyses on 32 isolates of KUN virus and 28 isolates of WN virus from different geographic areas, including a WN isolate from the recent outbreak in New York. Sequence comparisons showed that the KUN virus isolates from Australia were tightly grouped but that the WN virus isolates exhibited substantial divergence and could be differentiated into four distinct groups. KUN virus isolates from Australia were antigenically homologous and distinct from the WN isolates and a Malaysian KUN virus. Our results suggest that KUN and WN viruses comprise a group of closely related viruses that can be differentiated into subgroups on the basis of genetic and antigenic analyses. 698Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 West Nile Virus Table 1.

Primer KUN5276 was used with primer KUN4778 (ATA ATG ACA AGC GGG CTG ACC C) for the remaining isolates. The region of the virus genome encompassing the terminus of the nonstructural protein, NS5 and the 5' end of the 3' untranslated region (3’UTR), was amplified by using the previously published universal flavivirus PCR primers EMF1 and VD8 (23). Both strands of the PCR product were then sequenced on a 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Internation- al [ABI], Foster City, CA, USA) by using the same primer pair. The two sequences derived from each PCR product were initially aligned by using the program SeqEd (ABI) and a consensus sequence determined. The consensus sequences were then aligned by using the program Clustal W (24), and results were further analyzed by using phylogenetic programs in Bionavigator (http://www.bionavigator.com). Percentage nucleotide similarity was calculated by the Old Distance (GCG) program, and bootstrap confidence levels were calculated with 1,000 replicates by using the Consense program (25). Sequences determined in this study have been deposited in GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) (Table 1). Additional sequences included in this analysis are listed in Table 2. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Antigenic profiles of each isolate were compared by using a panel of anti-KUN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (26,27) and anti-WN MAbs (28,29) in ELISA as described (26). All MAbs were produced to the E protein except for 3.1112G, which was specific for the NS1 protein. Results Genetic Analysis In accordance with previous reports (16,18,21), the phylogenetic trees generated from both E gene and NS5/ 3'UTR sequences grouped most of the isolates into two major lineages (Figures 1 and 2). Australian KUN isolates and WN isolates from North, West, and central Africa; southern and eastern Europe; India; the Middle East; and New York constituted lineage I. Lineage II comprised WN isolates from West, central, and East Africa and Madagascar. Genetic lineage was not significantly associated with date or source of isolation, with most isolates of both lineages coming from human, mosquito, and avian sources between 1950 and 1990. However, as noted, all viruses isolated during outbreaks of human or avian disease in the last decade belonged to lineage I. Lineage I viruses grouped together with an average sequence identity of 80% (E gene) and 77% (NS5/3'UTR), while the viruses of lineage II contained a single cluster with an average identity of 82% and 83%, respectively. The lineage I viruses were further separated into three clusters: the Australian KUN isolates; the Indian WN viruses; and WN isolates from Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The divergence observed between lineage I and lineage II viruses was in the range of 16.5% to 30.8% and 19% to 36.5% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. High bootstrap confidence levels (100%) for the sequences of the NS5/3'UTR also support the separation of the Table 2.

The clustering of the Indian WN group in lineage I based on sequences in the E gene, however, was at a lower bootstrap confidence level (63%). The sequence of the virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502- 66, grouped outside the two lineages described. Similarly, the KOU virus, which was 72%-73% identical to KUN MP502-66, did not group with either lineage. The range of percentage divergence between KUN MP502-66 and KOU viruses with the lineage I and lineage II viruses (Table 3) shows that these two isolates display similar divergence from all other isolates in this study, supporting their grouping outside the two main lineages. The viruses of lineage I group together in three tight clusters. The first of these includes the Australian KUN viruses, which were 94% identical when sequences of the E gene were compared and 90% when the sequences of the NS5/ 3'UTR were compared. High bootstrap confidence levels (100% for sequences from the E gene and 99% for sequences from the NS5/3’UTR) separated the Australian KUN viruses from the other isolates. However, extremely low bootstrap confidence levels were observed for most of the branches between the Australian KUN viruses in both dendrograms, which also suggests that these viruses are closely related and cannot be definitively separated from each other. The Indian viruses also cluster together, with a sequence identity of 97% and 98% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. The WN isolates in the remaining cluster of lineage I are 90% and 97% identical, respectively, for the regions sequenced. When compared with the Australian KUN isolates, this cluster, which includes the 1999 New York isolate, shared a sequence identity of 89% for the E gene and Figure 1.

Similarly, when the sequences of the Australian KUN isolates were compared with those of the WN Indian viruses, they were 80% identical for the E gene and 77% identical for the NS5/3'UTR. In comparison, the two clusters of WN viruses in lineage I and the WN isolates in lineage II shared an average sequence identity of only 78% and 71% for the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. These results demonstrate that the sequences of some WN isolates are more closely related to the Australian KUN viruses than to other WN isolates. The high degree of nucleotide sequence homology within clusters is consistent with the observed similarity of the amino acid sequences. The most notable variation in amino acid sequence in this study appears around the potential glycosylation site at amino acid 154 of the E protein (Figure 3). The Australian KUN viruses generally contain either the glycosylation motif NYS at this position or the sequence NYF, which abolishes glycosylation of the E protein. In contrast, the KUN virus SH183 has a 154N→ K substitution, which also ablates the potential for glycosylation at this site. In comparison with the KUN prototype, the amino acids 159 (T→ I, T→ V, or T→ Q) and 162 (A→ T) of all the WN isolates in this study contain an amino acid substitution. The KUN isolate P1553 also differs from the KUN prototype at amino acid 159 (T→ I). Two aberrant isolates, 63134Ent280 and WNFCG, incur a deletion of four amino acids (154 through 157), which also abolishes the glycosylation site. Our results concur with those of Berthet et al. (16), who suggested the presence of signature motifs within the E gene that support the segregation of WN viruses into two lineages. These signature residues include the amino acid substitu- tions from lineage I→ II as follows: 172A→ S, 205T→ S, and 210T→ S. The amino acid substitution 208T→ A holds true in general; however, two of the Indian isolates (lineage I) have K at this position and WNFCG (lineage II) has E. Of particular note is the substitution at amino acid 199. The Australian KUN isolates (199S) share the same amino acid as the lineage II WN viruses, while the lineage I viruses contain an N residue at this position. We have also identified an additional three signature motifs (I→ II) at amino acids 128R→ W, 129T→ I, and 131L→ Q. When we attempted to place the Malaysian KUN isolate within either lineage by using these signature motifs, the residues at 128, 129, 131, 172, and 208 were similar to those of lineage I viruses, but the residues at Figure 3. Amino acid alignment of the region surrounding the potential glycosylation site of the E protein (shown in bold). KUN viruses not shown display the identical amino acid sequence as the prototype or the isolate OR205, depending on the glycosylation status of the virus. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. 702Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 West Nile Virus Figure 4. Amino acid alignment of the distal region of the NS5 protein. The KUN viruses not shown display a similar amino acid sequence to the prototype, except for a few minor point mutations not found within the signature motifs. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. 205 and 210 were consistent with those of lineage II viruses. Residue 199 (D) was unlike any of the other viruses. The KOU isolate displayed more similarities with the lineage II WN viruses (residues 131, 172, 199, and 210) when signature motifs were compared. Residues 129 and 208 differed from viruses of both lineages. We have identified signature motifs within the NS5 protein that correlate with the separation of the two lineages. Substitutions between lineages I→ II include 860A→ T, 869Q→ H, 878I→ V (except for the isolate MgAn798, which has 878I→ L), and 899L→ V (except for the isolate ArNa1047, which has 899L→ I) (Figure 4). At amino acid 877, the lineage I WN viruses are separated again from the lineage II WN viruses with an A→ S substitution; however, the KUN isolates (including MP502-66 from Malaysia) have the same motif as the lineage II WN viruses (877S). The amino acid substitution at 903 separates the Indian WN viruses (903S) from the WN and KUN viruses of both lineages (903T), instead grouping them with the Malaysian isolate and the KOU virus. Once again, the signature motifs cannot be used to classify the Malaysian isolate and KOU virus into either lineage. Nucleotide sequences in the 3'UTR of the viruses included in this study had a highly variable region in both length and nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the open reading frame stop codon (Figure 5). Deletions as well as point mutations were observed in this region, which varied from 38 (MgAn798) to 129 (ArNa1047) nt in length. The Australian KUN viruses displayed only point mutations when compared with the KUN prototype, except for the isolate P1553, which contained a 7-nt insertion, consistent with the WN viruses of lineage I. The long deletion in the nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of the WN prototype virus, WNFCG (53 nt), has been described (31); it is also present in the sequences of another two lineage II WN viruses analyzed in this study, Sarafend (53 nt) and MgAn798 (65 nt). The rest of the 3'UTR for these viruses was found to be highly conserved. Antigenic Analysis The MAb 10A1, produced to the KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted specifically with the Australian KUN isolates in ELISA and did not react with the KUN isolate from Malaysia (MP502-66) nor with KOU virus or any of the lineage I or lineage II WN viruses (Table 4). The MAb 546 (29), produced to the WN strain Eg101, reacted with all the lineage I and lineage II WN isolates except WN-Sarafend; it did not react with the KOU, KUN, or Malaysian viruses. The MAbs 2B2, produced to the KUN isolate MRM 16 (27), and 2B4, produced to the WN isolate H442 (28), reacted with all the isolates in the study, while the MAbs 3.67G and 3.91D, again produced to the KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all the isolates except WN-Sarafend. The MAb 3.1112G, produced to the NS1 protein of KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all isolates except KOU. The Mab binding patterns (Table 4) clearly digress and fail to differentiate KUN and WN isolates into two distinct groups. Instead, they define five distinct antigenic groups: Australian KUN viruses, Malaysian KUN virus, lineage I and lineage II WN viruses, WN-Sarafend, and KOU virus. Conclusion The results of the phylogenic analysis in this report clearly illustrate that the KUN, WN, and KOU viruses make up a closely related group of viruses, which can be further subdivided into several subgroups on the basis of genetic and antigenic data. Previous phylogenic studies have also shown that KUN and WN viruses share a close relationship (16- 18,21). This report however, further defines this relationship by using a comprehensive panel of both viruses. Also included in this study were several anomalous isolates, including an isolate from Southeast Asia (MP502-66), a laboratory-adapted WN strain of uncertain passage history and origin (Sarafend), and a flavivirus from West Africa (KOU), which has been shown to be closely related to the KUN/WN group of viruses. The region sequenced in the E gene spans a glycosylation site that, although highly conserved among viruses of the JE antigenic subgroup, is absent from many KUN and WN isolates (16,26; Scherret JH, Khromykh AA, Mackenzie JS, Hall RA, unpub. data). While glycosylation at this site has been associated with neuroinvasiveness of WN isolates in mice (32,33), the biological significance of E protein glycosylation is still unclear. Indeed, sequence analysis of the E gene of WN viruses responsible for fatal outbreaks of encephalitis in Romania (Rom 96) and New York (NY99) showed that only the latter contained a potential glycosylation site, casting doubt on the importance of E protein glycosylation in viral pathogenesis. However, our studies and those of others have shown that limited passage of WN and KUN viruses in some cell types can alter the glycosylation status of the E protein and that analysis of passaged viral isolates should be interpreted with caution 703Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 Emerging Infectious Diseases West Nile Virus Figure 5. Nucleotide sequence alignment of the 3'UTR (untranslated region) proximal to the open reading frame stop codon (shown in bold) showing distinctive insertions or deletions. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. (33; Scherret JH, Khromykh AA, Mackenzie JS, Hall RA, unpub. data). The 3'UTR of flaviviruses ranges in length from 400 nt to 600 nt and is thought to play a crucial role in the initiation and regula- tion of viral translation, replica- tion, and assembly. It includes a potential stable secondary RNA structure at its terminus (2,34-38), and upstream it contains several domains that appear to be con- served among mosquito-borne fla- viviruses (2,39, 40). Men et al. (41) have suggested that deletions in the distal 80 nt to 90 nt would most likely lead to disruption of the stem-loop and loss of viability. In contrast, the region sequenced in this study contains highly variable regions suitable for genetic classi- fication and analysis of the relationships among viruses, which had been subjected to deletions or insertions or both during evolution (17). Phylogenetic trees con- structed from sequence data from both regions identified two major lineages, consistent with previous reports (16,18,21). These two lineages did not separate the KUN isolates from the WN isolates; rather, they emphasized the close link between KUN and WN viruses of lineage I. Nevertheless, within lineage I, the Australian KUN isolates formed a tight cluster with an average nucleotide divergence of 6% for the E gene and 10% for the NS5/3'UTR. In con- trast, the WN isolates were spread between the two lineages in three clusters, with a divergence of up to 30.6% for sequences of the E gene and 28.3% for sequences of the NS5/3'UTR. Signature motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences of the E and NS5 proteins also support the separation of the viruses into two lineages. The virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502-66, and the African virus, KOU, pose a conundrum as to their relationship with the WN and KUN group of viruses. Statistical support for clustering with either of the WN lineages was poor, suggesting that they represent two single-isolate lineages. Although our previous findings suggested that the Malaysian KUN isolate may represent an evolutionary link between the KUN and WN viruses (17), the lack of sequence identity between KUN MP502-66 and the KUN/WN group of viruses in our study suggests that these viruses have evolved separately from a common ancestor.

The WN-specific MAb used in this study, 546, could not distinguish subgroups within the WN group of viruses; however, Besselaar and Blackburn (28) and Damle et al. (42) have differentiated Indian WN isolates from lineage I South African strains by using MAbs, consistent with the earlier studies of Hammam et al. (43,44). These findings support our sequence data, which show tight clustering of the Indian isolates on a separate branch from other WN isolates in the phylogenetic trees (Figures 1 and 2). Additional MAbs to the E protein of WN viruses may be required to differentiate between lineage I and lineage II viruses. The unique binding pattern of anti-E MAbs to the Sarafend WN isolate is difficult to explain in light of the E gene sequencing results and amino acid alignments, which show that this virus is similar to other lineage II viruses. However, Sarafend also differs from other WN viruses in the way that it buds from the cell membrane of infected cells (45). Sequencing of the entire prM and E genes of this virus may identify the basis for structural differences in the envelope heterodimer that account for the loss of MAb binding sites and unusual virion maturation. Phylogenetic analyses enable more precise determina- tion of the relationships among similar viruses and consequently aid in identifying the origin of unknown viruses in subsequent outbreaks. The importance of defining the relationship between the KUN and WN viruses was emphasized during the 1999 outbreak of viral encephalitis in New York City (46,47). Until recently, WN and KUN had been classified as distinct virus types in the Flavivirus genus. However, the latest report by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (25) recognized that KUN and WN should not be classified as two separate species and designated KUN as a subtype of WN. Our results suggest that this definition requires further consideration. The species should perhaps be further subdivided into at least six subtypes on the basis of the clusters of viruses displayed in the phylogenetic trees. Subtypes would then include lineage II WN group, Indian WN group, Australian KUN group, lineage I WN group, Malaysian group, and KOU group. Indeed, the assessment of viruses from each subgroup for transmissibility by the major mosquito vectors of each geographic region and relative virulence and amplification in primate, equine, and avian species will provide valuable information on the likelihood and possible consequences of the spread of these viruses to new geographic regions. Additional studies of cross-protection between subgroups by natural infection or immunization with vaccines derived from these viruses and the specificity and sensitivity of serologic and molecular assays for each subgroup in monitoring and diagnostic applications will be useful in defining control strategies.

The proportion of USUV-positive individuals among the investigated dead birds decreased dramatically after 2004. To test the hypothesis that establishment of herd immunity might be responsible, serological examinations of susceptible wild birds were performed. Blood samples of 442 wild birds of 55 species were collected in 4 consecutive years (2003–2006). In addition, 86 individuals from a birds of prey rehabilitation centre were bled before, at the peak, and after the 2005 USUV transmission season in order to identify titre dynamics and seroconversions. The haemagglutination inhibition test was used for screening and the plaque reduction neutralization test for confirmation. While in the years 2003 and 2004 the proportion of seropositive wild birds was <10%, the percentage of seroreactors raised to >50% in 2005 and 2006. At the birds of prey centre, almost three quarters of the owls and raptors exhibited antibodies before the 2005 transmission season; this percentage dropped to less than half at the peak of USUV transmission and raised again to almost two thirds after the transmission season. * Corresponding author.

Keywords: Usutu virus; USUV; Serology; Wild birds; Herd immunity 1. Introduction Usutu virus (USUV), a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic group within the mosquito-borne cluster of the genus Flavivirus (Kuno et al., 1998) was isolated for the first time from mosquitoes (Culex univittatus) in South Africa in 1959 and named after a river in Swaziland. Although the virus had been detected several times in different mosquito and bird species in Africa, it had never been associated with clinical disease in birds or mammals and was therefore widely scientifically ignored. In summer 2001, however, USUVemerged unexpectedly in central Europe and was responsible for an episode of mortality among Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) and great grey owls (Strix nebulosa) in and around Vienna, Austria (Weissenböck et al., 2002). In the following years the same virus strain continued to kill birds in eastern Austria (Weissenböck et al., 2003b; Chvala et al., 2007). This observation showed that USUV had managed to overwinter and had been able to establish an efficient local bird–mosquito transmission cycle (Weissenböck et al., 2003a). Meanwhile, USUV-associated bird mortality has been registered in other central European countries like Hungary (Bakonyi et al., unpublished data), Switzer- land (ProMED-mail) and Italy (Dorrestein et al., 2007). Surveillance data of USUV-associated bird deaths in Austria indicated that seasons of massive USUV-associated bird losses (2001–2003) were followed by seasons with significant decline of USUV-linked avian mortality (2004–2006) (Chvala et al., 2007). In addition to climatic reasons (the summers of 2004 and 2005 had unusually low average temperatures in Austria, http://www.zamg.ac.at) or decreased virulence of the circulating virus another possible explanation for this phenomenon would be a progressive seroconversion in the Austrian wild bird population. As it has to be expected that USUV will continue to expand its area of activity during the next years, data on seroprevalence and potential herd immunity in the European area affected first, i.e. eastern Austria, might be useful for other scientists and wildlife conserva- tionists having to deal with this phenomenon in the future. The aims of the present study were first to evaluate the proportion of USUV antibody positives among wild birds in Austria and to record changes during the course of time. Second, we intended a longitudinal serological study with three blood collection time- points from the same individuals during one transmission season in order to determine the dynamics of change in antibody titre to USUV in naturally infected birds. For this part of the study an owl and raptor rehabilitation centre situated within the USUV-endemic area in eastern Austria was chosen because (i) some owl species (great grey owl, Strix nebulosa, Tengmalm’s owl, Aegolius funereus) easily acquired USUV infection and also succumbed to it, (ii) birds of prey and owls were found to be frequently affected by the related West Nile virus (WNV) in North America (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Gancz et al., 2004; Wünschmann et al., 2004) and (iii) because the centre offered a large collection of wild birds in an open mosquito-accessible environment with the opportunity of repeated blood collections of the same birds, something not easily done with wild birds. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sera for seroprevalence study Bird sera were collected in 4 consecutive years, between August 2003 and May 2006. As the transmission season of USUV is most likely restricted http://www.zamg.ac.at/ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237381545_Emergence_of_Usutu_virus_an_African_Mosquito-Borne_Flavivirus_of_the_Japanese_Encephalitis_Virus_Group?el=1_x_8&enrichId=rgreq-fb9ea98f-521d-4cc1-b70b-ad6d828d1b9f&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzU5NzIxNjM7QVM6OTk0NDM4MjMwODc2MjhAMTQwMDcyMDY2MzYyMg== T. Meister et al. / Veterinary Microbiology 127 (2008) 237–248 239 to the months July to September, the data of the 2006 sera reflect viral exposure which had happened up to the 2005 transmission season. In total, sera of 442 birds were included. A total of 113 sera were collected in 2003 (between August and December), 109 sera in 2004 (January to October), 197 sera in 2005 (March to October), and finally, 23 sera were collected in the first 5 months of 2006. As it significantly influences the interpretation of the results, a possible exposure in the previous year(s) was especially considered for the 2005 and 2006 sera. The sources of sera were (i) wild birds captured in mist nets or other trapping devices especially for the purpose of USUV serosurveillance (2003: 14; 2004: 27; 2005: 91; 2006: 23), (ii) sick or injured birds brought to the bird clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, for treatment (2003: 28; 2004: 2; 2005: 45), (iii) birds from the above mentioned owl and raptor rehabilita- tion centre (2003: 28; 2005: 38), and (iv) dead birds submitted for necropsy (2003: 43; 2004: 80; 2005: 23). The sera originated from 55 different species of birds. The huge majority of the birds were from USUV- endemic areas in Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgen- land. Only seven birds were from areas where USUV activity has not been found so far. 2.2. Longitudinal serosurvey in captive birds of prey All birds originated from a birds of prey rehabilitation centre which is located in the village Haringsee (488110N, 168460E) in the geographic area Marchfeld in Lower Austria. The entire area is 11,000 m2 in size. There are 70 separate aviaries covering a total of 3000 m2. The birds were separated according to species, and aviaries with birds of the same species were located in close proximity to each other. The station mainly provides medical care and shelter for injured bird foundlings and confiscated animals, and information for the interested public. USUV activity has been recognized in the area since 2003 with the virus found in dead blackbirds and in mosquitoes (Chvala et al., 2007). Blood samples were collected from 86 birds belonging to 9 species: 6 species of the family Strigidae: 8 eagle owls (Bubo bubo), 18 barn owls (Tyto alba), 14 tawny owls (Strix aluco), 4 little owls (Athene noctua), 5 long-eared owls (Asio otus), 1 Ural owl (Strix uralensis), 2 accipitrid species: 20 common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and 4 marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus), and 1 falcon species, namely 12 common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). From each bird three blood samples were taken at approximately 2-month intervals during 2005: the first blood samples prior to any anticipated USUV activity (May 25), the second sample on August 29 at the time when in the previous years USUV activity had reached its peak, and the final sample was taken October 17, 2005, when, according to the experiences from the previous years, USUV activity should have ceased and antibodies due to recent exposure should have developed. All birds were after hatch-year birds (older than 1 year), except for one Ural owl, which was a hatch-year fledgling. None of the birds showed clinical signs during the surveillance period. For USUV antibody assays 0.2–0.5 ml of blood was drawn from the cutaneous ulnar vein. The blood was transferred into heparin–lithium tubes (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) and centrifuged at 2000 � g for 15 min. The plasma was separated from the clot and stored at�20 8C until use. In order to rule out test variabilities, all three blood collections of the birds of prey rehabilitation centre were tested in one investigation and carried out and read by the same investigator. 2.3. Serological tests The majority of the bird sera obtained for the seroprevalence study were examined by the haemag- glutination inhibition test (HIT). Whenever possible, HIT positives were confirmed by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). However, due to the small quantity of some sera, either this confirmation could not be performed or it was decided to use the PRNT only. All serum samples of the longitudinal study were analysed by HIT for initial screening. Positive samples (titre �1:20) were also tested by PRNT to evaluate the specificity of the HIT. To rule out a possible cross-reaction of the tests with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and WNV a number of randomly selected USUV-positive sera (TBEV: 55; WNV: 49) were also tested with serological test systems established for detection of antibodies to these viruses. T. Meister et al. / Veterinary Microbiology 127 (2008) 237–248240 2.4. HIT for USUV and TBEV antibodies The standard HIT was performed as previously described by Clarke and Casals (1958) and as adapted for USUV by Chvala et al. (2005). In brief, non- specific inhibitors and natural haemagglutinins were removed by kaolin treatment and absorption with goose erythrocytes, respectively. Serial dilutions of kaolin-treated bird sera were mixed with eight haemagglutinating (HA) units of USUV strain Vienna 2001-blackbird or TBEV strain KEM1 antigen (Molnar, 1982), respectively. Tests were performed in U-shaped microtitre plates. The HIT titre was determined as the highest serum dilution that caused complete inhibition of erythrocyte agglutination. Sera with a titre of 1:20 and higher were considered positive. 2.5. PRNT for USUV and WNV antibodies The PRNT method for USUVand WNV antibodies was performed as described by de Madrid and Porterfield (1974), adopted to a microtechnique (Hubálek et al., 1979). The sera were inactivated at 56 8C for 30 min prior to testing. The PRNTs were run in microtitre plates with flat-bottomed wells. For USUV the above mentioned virus strain Vienna-2001 blackbird (Bako- nyi et al., 2004) and porcine kidney (PK) cells, and for WNV the WNV topotype strain Eg-101 and the pig kidney embryo cell line SPEV was used. Twofold serum dilutions were made in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), or in case of WNV in L-15 medium; 30 ml of diluted sera were mixed with 30 ml of virus suspension containing 100 plaque-forming units of the virus and incubated for 60 min at 37 8C. Then 60 ml of cell suspension in MEM with 3% foetal calf serum (in case of WNV L-15 medium with 2% foetal calf serum) was added to each well and incubated at 37 8C for 4 h. Thereafter 120 ml of a carboxy-methyl cellulose overlay was added to each well and incubated at 37 8C for 3 days (5 days in case of WNV). The fluid was removed and 150 ml of the colouring naphtol blue black solution was added for 40 min at room temperature. The PRNT titre was determined as the highest serum dilution with a 90% reduction of the number of plaques. Sera with a titre of at least 1:20 were considered positive. The specificity of this assay for antibodies to the viruses tested (i.e. USUV and WNV) had been validated by using WNV- and USUV- positive test sera. Cross-reactivity was minimal and only occurred in sera with high titres to one of the viruses to a titre of at least four dilution steps less than the homolog virus. 2.6. RT-PCR for detection of viraemia At the assumed peak of USUV activity (August), we also took blood samples from 32 larger birds (8 eagle owls, 20 buzzards, and 4 marsh harriers) for determination of viraemia. From these birds, blood was drawn from the ulnar vein into EDTA-treated tubes (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany), centrifuged at 6700 � g for 5 min, and the plasma was saved for serological studies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from the buffy coat using erythrocyte lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAwas extracted from the PBMCs using the QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and RT-PCRs were performed in a continuous one-step RT-PCR system employing USUV-specific primer pairs (Bakonyi et al., 2004; Weissenböck et al., 2004). 3. Results 3.1. Antibodies to USUV are found in an increasing proportion of wild birds between 2003 and 2006 Of the 222 birds tested in 2003 and 2004, 19 (8.5%) were positive for USUV by HIT. The titres ranged from 1:20 to 1:1280, with a geometrical mean titre of 51.8. All positives except one were confirmed by PRNT. Four of the positive birds were necropsy cases with an acute USUV infection. Among the 19 examined owls 6 (31.6%) were positive. The USUV positive sera were also tested by HIT for antibodies to TBEV. One serum (with an USUV titre of 1:1280) showed a positive reaction (1:80). All other sera were TBEV antibody negative. In 2005 and early 2006 a total of 220 sera was tested by HIT (150) and/or PRNT (157). In 87 cases a comparative evaluation of both tests could be performed.

Of the sick or dead birds examined 29 had an acute USUV infection with characteristic lesions and presence of virus in a number of tissues. Out of these birds only four were serologically positive. An interesting aspect of this study were the serological data of the 78 examined juvenile birds (Table 2). Forty-two (54.5%) of them were serologi- cally USUV antibody positive. Among them were five Ural owls whose antibody titres were 1:20 (1), 1:40 (2), and 1:80 (2). The adult females that produced these six nestlings had titres of 1:320 and 1:2560, respectively. The mother of the other juveniles was unknown. 3.2. Captive birds of prey show a high proportion of USUV antibody positives and considerable HIT titre dynamics during one transmission season In May 2005, 63 (73.3%) out of 86 birds exhibited HIT antibodies to USUV (titres �1:20). The titres ranged from 1:20 to 1:640, with the majority (69.8%) having a titre of 1:80 or lower. In August 2005, the number of seropositives declined to 39 (45.3%), the majority of which (56.4%) had low titres of 1:20 or 1:40. In October 2005, 56 (65.1%) were serologi- cally positive, with a higher proportion of medium and high titres (almost 60.7% with titres �1:80) compared to the previous two timepoints (Figs. 2 and 3). A total of 143 sera, which showed a HIT titre of least 1:20 were tested by PRNT for confirmation. 85.3% of the PRNT titres were in accordance with the HIT results. Sixty-two of the sera sampled in May were tested by PRNT. Of these, 25 showed a lower titre compared to HIT, four HIT positives were T.

Of the sera taken in August 34 were tested by PRNT. In 10 of the samples the PRNT titre was lower than the HIT titre. Two sera were negative by PRNT and 10 were cytotoxic. Of the October samples, 47 were tested by PRNT. Twenty-five sera had a lower PRNT titre compared to HIT. Five sera were negative and six were cytotoxic. 3.3. Low titre haemagglutinating antibodies to TBEV and neutralizing antibodies to WNV are present in a few birds A portion of USUV antibody positive sera from the third bleeding time were also tested by HIT for TBEV antibodies. Only 7 of 55 exhibited a low-range titre of 1:20 and 1:40, respectively. Forty-nine USUV antibody positive birds were tested by PRNT for WNV antibodies. Of 19 birds from the first bleeding time, 15 were negative, 1 kestrel showed a titre of 1:40, and 2 marsh harriers and 1 barn owl had titres of 1:20. Of the 11 tested birds of the second bleeding time, 7 were negative, 7 birds exhibited titres of 1:20 (common buzzard, Ural owl) and 2 kestrels had titres of 1:80 and 1:160, respectively. In October, the third bleeding, 19 birds were tested, 12 of which were negative; 5 had titres of 1:20, and 2, both kestrels, showed titres of 1:80 and 1:160, respectively. 3.4. No evidence of viraemia in the sampled birds at the peak of the transmission period USUV nucleic acid sequences were not detected in any of the examined PBMC samples by RT-PCR. 4. Discussion Since its first documented emergence in central Europe in 2001, USUV has been associated with rising avian mortality in the affected areas which was followed by a rapid decline of USUV-associated deaths by 2004 until present. A major aim of the study was to discern, whether an increasing number of seroreactors in the wild bird population might have contributed to this phenomenon. The data point towards a low USUV antibody prevalence in samples from 2003 to 2004, and T. Meister et al. / Veterinary Microbiology 127 (2008) 237–248244 Fig. 2. Histogram depicting the percentage of captive birds of prey with certain HIT antibody titres at the different timepoints of sampling. a clearly increased antibody prevalence in samples taken in 2005 and 2006. This change is not likely to be due to biased sample selection. Especially two subpopulations of examined birds – blackbirds and owls – originated from comparable habitats during the entire investigation period. In the cases in which comparative investigations of sera were carried out by HITand PRNT the majority of the HIT titres were confirmed by PRNT. Generally the PRNT titres were lower. Although the HIT is not considered to be highly specific, it proved useful as initial screening test in the present study. Possible Fig. 3. Histogram depicting the HI titre dynamics in the birds of prey dur individuals the geometric mean titre (GMT), and the minimum and maxi species demonstrate the values at the three sampling timepoints. cross-reactions or false positive reactions did not occur on a grand scale. The only other flavivirus known to be enzootic in Austria is TBEV. The most likely explanation for the few seroreactors to TBEV in the used HIT is cross-reactivity with USUV, as the TBEV titres were generally 8–16 times lower than those to USUV. HIT cross-reactivity between these two distantly related flaviviruses has also been previously noticed (Casals and Brown, 1954; de Madrid and Porterfield, 1974; Stiasny et al., 2006). Also cross-reactivity of USUV with WNV including associated lineages (e.g. Rabensburg virus (RabV) (Bakonyi et al., 2005)) is very likely. Using the less specific HIT, distinction of USUV- and WNV-titres might have been difficult or impossible. Therefore, the more specific PRNT was used in the search for WNV antibodies. The WNV serological data of a randomly chosen subset of samples showed several reactors, the majority of which had a low titre. These low titres are explainable by cross-reactivity to USUV, as all these cases had high USUV titres. The few birds with a moderate or high titre to WNV (e.g. common kestrel) could represent WNV- (or RabV-) infected animals, because the locality, where RabV was isolated, is situated very closely to the USUV study site (Hubálek et al., 1998). As the vast majority of these birds had ing timecourse. For each species which comprised more than seven mum titres are shown in columns.

Meister et al. / Veterinary Microbiology 127 (2008) 237–248 245 high haemagglutinating and moderate neutralizing antibody titres to USUV, cross-reactivity of WNV antibodies in the USUV assays seem rather unlikely. Thus, these kestrels might represent double infections with USUV and a representative of one of the WNV lineages. The presence of a few seroreactors to WNV is not surprising and is in line with previous seroepidemiological studies from comparable geo- graphical regions (Hubálek and Halouzka, 1999; Hubálek et al., 2005). The serological data indicate that species do not differ in the likelihood to acquire USUV infection. However, there seem to be great differences with respect to the expression of clinical symptoms: while certain species, like blackbirds, great grey owls and obviously house sparrows – as recently shown in Switzerland (Steinmetz et al., 2007) – succumb in high numbers to the infection, other species never exhibited significant USUV-associated mortality. A small number of seropositive birds, especially among those captured in 2005, were long distance migrants, i.e. birds with wintering habitats in sub- Saharan Africa. Adult birds of this group could well have acquired USUV antibodies in Africa. However, the vast majority of these birds were identified as juveniles, i.e. they had hatched in Austria several weeks or months prior to sampling, and provided that maternally transferred antibodies do not last until several months of age, they most likely have been exposed to the virus in Austria. Data concerning persistence of maternally transferred antibodies in wild birds are scarce (Müller et al., 2004; Hahn et al., 2006); thus it cannot be definitely excluded that some of these antibodies have their origin in Africa. The few seropositive juvenile birds for which the mother was known were five Ural owl nestlings with an age of 62 days at sampling. The USUV antibody levels of these birds were markedly lower than those of their mothers. As sampling in these nestlings took place before the transmission season the results suggest that they might have acquired antibodies through passive transmission and that detectable amounts of passively transferred USUVantibodies are detectable up to 2 months. In contrast, Gibbs et al. (2005) found maternal WNV antibodies in rock pigeons only up to 30 days after hatching. Alternatively, it cannot be ruled out that the juvenile Ural owls were exposed to one of the alternative transmission routes (see below), which are not necessarily linked with mosquito activity. While in 2003 the proportion of USUV-positives among dead birds collected during a surveillance program was more than 50%, this percentage dropped to 5% and less in 2004 and 2005 (Chvala et al., 2007). One possible explanation for such a phenomenon could be establishment of herd immunity resulting in an increasing number of birds born with passive immunity under the protection of which active immunity can develop in the case of exposure. Although the serological data of the 2004 birds did not yet suggest such a phenomenon, the closer inspection of the 2005 data shows that more than a third of the samples were taken before the transmission season and thus indicate titres acquired in the previous year(s) or through maternal antibodies in hatchlings. In fact, 60% of this s"

SEYMOUR,t P. H. PERALTA, ANDG. G. MONTGOMERY Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, Panama 5, Republic ofPanamd, and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, P.O. Box 2072, Balboa, Republic of Panama Abstract. Plasmas of sloths and other Central Panamanian wild vertebrates were tested for plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibodies against four flaviviruses and one alpha virus. Forty percent of 97 two-toed sloths, Choloepus hoffmanni, and 8% of 168 three-toed sloths, Brady/ms variegatus, were specifically positive against St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. The prevalence of antibody against SLE virus was considerably higher in sloths than in any other group of wild vertebrates tested, including birds, and was found mainly in adult sloths. Specific PRN antibody against yellow fever (YF) virus was found only in monkeys. A high prevalence of PRN antibody against Ihhcus and Mayaro viruses was detected in agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, and against Mayaro virus in howler monkeys, Alouatta villosa. No plasma was specifically positive against Bussuquara virus. The results are interpreted as evidence that sloths are probably not important hosts in jungle YF cycles, but may be sig nificant amplifying hosts in tropical SLE virus cycles. Tree sloths are New World arboreal mammals related to armadillos and anteaters. They occur from Honduras to Argentina. The two existing genera include Bradypus, the three-toed sloths, and Choloepus, the two-toed sloths. Although they share the same arboreal habitat and many con vergent anatomical features, the behavioral and anatomical differences between the two genera are clear enough to place them in separate families. â€˜@2 Sloths arc difficult or impossible to see when cam ouflaged in their forest canopy habitat, but they are nevertheless among the most abundant mam mals of the Neotropical forest.@5 Both genera arc characterized by bow body temperature and met abobic rate,6 and are highly evolved for a vege tanian@ Choloepus commonly survive in captivity for over 10 years,7 8 and probably both genera are bonghived in nature.

Interest in sloths as hosts of flaviviruses initially centered on the search for alternate hosts in New World jungle yellow fever (YF) cycles, which are usually considered to involve monkeys and forest canopy mosquitoes.9 10In early experimental work, Colombian two-toed sloths Choloepus didactylus showed little potential as YF amplifying hosts.9 In 1974, P. A. Webb and K. M. Johnson of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory repeated this obser vation with the Panamanian species Choloepus hoffmanni ; however, they also showed that some Panamanian Bradypus variegatus sustained re markabby bong experimental YF viremias of un usually high titer, with no apparent ill effects.â€• The hypothesis that sloths are natural amphi fying hosts of YF virus was tested by field studies in Panama in 1974â€”76,during and after a wave of jungle YF. These and other concurrent field studies also included observations on related fla viviruses, among them St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, a human pathogen which is transmitted by mosquitoes among wild birds in most of North 12 In the tropics, SLE virus causes spo radic human illness, but its natural cycle is poorly 13 As with YF virus, inoculation of sloths with SLE virus produces prolonged vire mias of high@ Field studies of flavivirus in fections of sloths were therefore a test of the role of these animals in tropical cycles of SLE virus as well as YF virus.

At El Llano-CantI and Cenro Azul, howler monkeys and other mammals, apart from sloths, were shot. Mammals which were shot or which were cap tuned by ISPA were bled by cardiac puncture. Otherwise, sloths were bled from the brachial vein; rodents, bats and marsupials from the netroonbital sinus, and binds from the external jugular vein. In the field, whole hepaninized blood was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 2 hours of collection. Plasma was aseptically separated from hepanin ized blood either by centnifugation on by overnight settling, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen until transfer to electric freezers. Whole blood was stored at â€”60Â°C,and plasma at â€”20Â°C. Virus isolation attempts Heparinized whole blood (0. 1 ml) was inoculated onto tube cultures of Vero cells, which were main tamed at 35Â°Cand observed for 14 days. Neutralization tests Test viruses included the four sylvatic flavivi ruses known to occur in Panama: YF virus (French neutrotropic strain); SLE virus, stnain Buena Vis ta-7 , isolated from Panamanian mosquitoes in 1956; Bussuquana (BSQ) virus, strain GA-7, from Panamanian mosquitoes captured in 196 1; and Il heus (ILH) virus, strain Guat-245 , isolated in 1956 from Guatemalan mosquitoes. Mayano (MAY) vi rus, an alphavirus, was included as an antigen to control for non-specific plaque reduction, since it is antigenically distinct from the four flaviviruses; it was also included because its natural transmis sion cycle is thought to be similar to that of Neo tropical jungle YF virus. We used MAY strain Pan Ar 443 isolated in 1974 from Panamanian mosquitoes. Plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) tests were basically performed as described@ Briefly, plasmas were screened 1:8 against 40â€”250 (generally 50â€”100)plaque forming units (pfu) of challenge virus. Guinea pig serum at a final con centration of 1:60 was incorporated in the virus plasma mixture as a source of fresh serum factor. The mixtures were incubated at 4Â°Covernight be fore inoculation onto 2 cm2 Vero cell monolayens. A second overlay including neutral red followed 2 on 3 days after the initial overlay, which varied in composition for each virus. To enhance plaque clarity, Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium re placed the original basic nutrient medium in ILH virus tests; gum tnagacanth was used in various combinations with either aganose or agar in fla vivinus overlays. Plasmas reducing plaque counts by at beast 80% were retested in serial dilutions; 90% plaque ne duction by plasma diluted 1:16 was considered positive. Plasmas positive against any one flavi virus were subsequently titrated against all four flavivinuses with approximately equal test virus doses, for comparison of PRN titers. Low plasma quantities reduced the number of screening anti gens in tests of some animals. RESULTS Virus isolation attempts No flaviviruses were isolated from 45 Bradypus and 14 Choloepus. Other viruses isolated from these animals are described elsewhere. 15 Antibody titers and test specificity Ninety percent plaque reduction serum titers of 1:8 were considered negative because they wene not reproducible. Also, in other di'5 titers of 1:8 have been associated with low level inhibition of two or more unrelated viruses, suggesting broad spectrum non-specific activity. Ninety percent ne duction by plasmas diluted 1:16 was therefore considered positive, but most positive titers were at beast as high as 1:64. The frequency distribution of sloth antibody PRN titers against SLE virus are shown in Table 1, and are representative of positive reactions seen in this study against other togaviruses and in other vertebrates. A possible problem of cross-reactions between the four senobogically rebated flaviviruses was re solved by experimental demonstration of the spec ificity of sloth antibodies against SLE@ and by the infrequency of multiple reactions and con fusing titers in this study. In multiple positives, differences in titer as little as 4- on 8-fold occurred so rarely as to be insignificant, and in these cases, antibody was considered specific against the an tigen of higher titer for simplicity. Sloth plasmas were never positive against more than two of the four test flaviviruses.

Of 14 multiple flavivirus reactions involving sloths pos itive against SLE virus, 12 consisted of only a 1:8 reaction against another flavivirus, with the SLE virus titer higher by at beast 16-fold (Table 1). Only two sloth plasmas were considered to be pos itive against both SLE and another flavivirus. However the titers were 4- and 8-fold respectively higher against SLE virus than the other agent (ILH virus). The specificity of PRN reactions was as clear in most cases involving other flaviviruses and forest vertebrates as it was for SLE virus and sloths. No multiple positives were seen in three sloth plasmas positive against ILH virus and two anteaters and a bird positive against SLE virus. Of 12 monkeys positive against YF virus (titers 1:32â€”1:512, mc dian 1:128), eleven did not react with any other flavivirus even at a 1:8 plasma dilution. The twelfth monkey reacted at 1:128 against YF virus and 1:64 against SLE virus, and probably was infected by both agents. Three of four ILH virus antibody-positive plas mas from agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) were multiple flavivirus positives. Although reactions against ILH virus were always strongest (1:128- 1:1,024), titers against BSQ virus in three plasmas were only 2-, 4-, and 16-fold lower than against the corresponding ILH titers. Reactions against YF virus were 8- to 64-fold bower than those against ILH virus in two agouti phasmas. The inclusion of MAY virus, an ahphavirus, in the battery of test antigens proved useful in con trolling for non-specific plaque inhibition. The number of double alpha- and flavivirus positive plasmas was not greater than that expected by chance double infections. Yellowfever virus Only primates reacted specifically against YF virus (Table 2). Of 14 howler monkeys, A. villosa, from MajÃ©,only five juveniles did not have PRN antibody against YF virus; these five animals were born after the 1974 sylvatic YF wave had already passed through MajÃ©.Other MajÃ©monkeys spe cifically inhibiting YF virus antigen include two marmosets, Saguinus geoffroyi, and one night monkey Aotus trivirgatus. YF antibody was not detected in plasmas from 33 adult Bradypus, 16 adult Choloepus or any other non-primate species collected at MajÃ©4â€”26months after active YF transmission there. At El Llano-CartI, another forest locality which had suffered a sylvatic YF wave within 6 months previous to collection of plasmas, 9/15 adult howler monkey plasmas were positive against YF virus, in contrast with none of 10 adult Bradypus and none of three adult Choloepus sloths.

Although birds are gener ally considered to be the natural amplifying hosts of SLE virus in North America, only one tropical kingbird, Tyrannus melancholicus, was senoposi tive out of 75 birds of 39 species from MajÃ©tested. Specific antibody against SLE virus is wide spread in Panamanian sloths. A survey of sloths from five areas of central Panama showed that SLE virus infections arc common in both sloths species in Aguacate, Chihibre and Cerro Azul, as well as MajÃ©(Table 3, Fig. 1). Antibody against SLE virus was more prevalent in Choloepus than in Bradypus sloths in all positive localities.

The other was a radio-marked in fant Choloepus at Cerro Azub; it developed spe cHic PRN antibody against SLE virus between 17 September 1974, when its plasma titer was <1:8, and 6 November, when the titer was 1:32. Its mother also showed a significant rise in SLE an tibody titer during this period, from 1:8 to 1:32. Plasmas were tested in parallel and were uniform by negative against the other three flaviviruses. The baby was still attached to the mother, which was not lactating at either capture. No other se roconversions against SLE virus or any other fla vivirus were observed in other radiomarked sloths or sentinel rhesus monkeys at Cerno Azul.

Three of eight agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, from MajÃ© were specifically positive against ILH virus; and a fourth reacted to high titer against both ILH and BSQ viruses (Table 2). Bussuquara virus The only plasmas positive against BSQ virus were also positive to higher titer against another flavivirus. Mayaro virus The only species collected at MajÃ©with detect abbe neutralizing antibody against this virus were agoutis, D. punctata, and howler monkeys A. vil losa (Table 2). The median positive titer was 1:128 (range 1:32â€”1:512).AtAguacate, none of 14 Bradypus or 15 Choloepus was positive against Mayaro virus. DISCUSSION Interpretation of these results is facilitated by the paucity of flavivirus cross-reactions. Positive tests were usually monospecific in all species cx cept agoutis, and in the few cases of multiple pos itives, titers were almost always clearly higher against one particular flavivirus than against the other three. The rarity of hetenologous flavivirus reactions in sloths experimentally infected with SLE virus'4 fits well with these field data. Our results support the working hypothesis that New World sylvatic YF virus is a monkey virus. No evidence was found to suggest alternate hosts. 860 SEYMOUR, PERALTA, AND MONTGOMERY Prolonged non-fatal experimental YF viremias of high titer in B. variegatus have been uniformly followed by the development of neutralizing an tibody,1' but no neutralizing antibodies were de tected in adult Bradypus from two areas recently affected by sylvatic YF. Therefore, it is logical to infer that if any Bradypus sloths were naturally infected, their viremias were not long nor of high titer, and that this species did not amplify the transmission of YF virus. On the other hand, our results indicate a high prevalence of natural SLE virus infection in sloths of both species. The vertebrate hosts in tropical SLE cycles are not well understood. Previous iso lations from tropical vertebrates include strains from birds, an opposum, armadillos, two rodent species and a three-toed sloth,20 and from mites combed from a rice rat.2' At MajÃ©,specific anti body against SLE virus was found more frequent ly in sloths than in any other species or group of vertebrates tested. By itself, this observation sug gests that sloth antibody is useful as the best index of the past occurrence of SLE virus in a given area. However, in combination with the demon stration of high prolonged SLE viremias in both sloth species,'4 the serological evidence of natural infection suggests that sloths are important natu ral hosts of SLE virus. Their remarkable abun dance in tropical forests is little recognized but is epidemiologically important. Their density on Barro Colorado Island in Panama has been esti mated at 8.5 Bradypus and 1. 1 Choloepus pen hectare,1 and our unpublished data using identical techniques at Cerro Azul indicate similar densities and proportions. The lack of antibody against SLE virus in young animals may be interpreted as evidence that sloths are infected very infrequently, and gradually ac cumulate a high percentage of positives in a pop ulation only because of their long life span and slow population turnover. However, lack of an tibody in young animals may also be interpreted as evidence that SLE virus had not been active in the areas studied for 2 years or more. Little is known of the epidemiology of Neotropical SLE virus, and it may follow the pattern of intermit tent waves or wandering foci as classically seen for Neotnopical YF virus.22 In this case, dense sloths populations would be important sources of SLE virus. The recent isolation of SLE virus by Dr. F. P. Pinheiro from a Brazilian Bradypus tn dactylus is interesting in this respect.2Â° The observations of antibody against ILH and MAY viruses in agoutis D. punctata are intnigu ing but difficult to interpret. Antibody against MAY virus in howler monkeys agrees with pre vious observations on the ecology of this virus.23 The high titers and lack of double positives at a frequency higher than predicted by chance mdi cate that the results are specific. ILH virus has previously been isolated from binds in Panama.24 A final intriguing point found in these field re sults is the apparently nearly simultaneous SLE virus infections of the radio-marked Choloepus mother-baby pair. Either they were both infected by mosquito(es), or one infected the other with SLE virus by contact or aerosol, as observed for a baby Bnadypus and its experimentally infected mother. â€˜@ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Victor Herrera, George Bar nett, and Ruben Vflchez for their expertise and endurance in field work; to Magaly Ojeda, to John Walsh and the International Society for the Pro tection of Animals, and to Dr. Pedro Galindo and the staff of the Gorgas Laboratory Bayano Field Station, for the collection of blood samples from MajÃ©;to Julio Cisnenos and Eduardo Miranda, for their laboratory skills; to Dr. Thomas P.

To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belong- ing to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCR–positive bat species are considered abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats. To our knowledge, this study is the first study conducted in southeastern Mexico to identify DENV-2 in bats by a widely accepted RT-PCR protocol. The role that bats play on DENV’s ecology remains undetermined. Dengue fever is an important public health concern in the tropics,1–4 and ecological and epidemiological studies are needed to assess the role of bats and other mammals in a possible sylvatic maintenance cycle.5 Dengue viruses (DENVs) comprise four antigenically distinct but genetically related serotypes of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family).1 DENVs are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause one of the most common infectious diseases in humans in tropical regions.2 Their transmission includes an urban endemic/epidemic cycle between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans as the reservoir host and a sylvatic enzootic cycle between non-human primates and arboreal mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.3 The urban cycle is well-documented in the Neo- tropics, with four serotypes reported in urban areas,1–4 whereas the sylvatic cycle has been shown in West Africa and peninsu- lar Malaysia.5 Thus far, the sylvatic cycle has not been described in the Neotropics. However, in Bolivia, DENV sero- conversions among the indigenous Ayoreo people were found in a remote area where Ae. aegypti, the primary vector, was absent.6 This finding suggests a possible sylvatic cycle involving a different mosquito species or cross-reaction with antibodies to another flavivirus. In French Guiana, all four DENV sero- types have been identified by molecular methods in 92 wild mammals (bats, rodents, and marsupials) in all settings investi- gated: periurban, rural, and sparsely populated areas.7 This finding suggests that primarily urban DENV strains could infect wildlife in non-urban forested areas.7 The role of wildlife in DENV transmission remains unknown. Bats are important reservoirs of many viruses, such as rabies viruses, Nipah viruses, and coronaviruses.8–12 Flaviviridae are the second most frequently reported viral family in the order Chiroptera (13% frequency; second only to rhabdoviruses)9; however, their role in the dynamics of DENVs remains poorly understood. DENV have been reported in large frugivorous bats (Pteropus genus) in Australia.13 More recently, polymer- ase chain reaction (PCR) and antigen detection (direct immuno- fluorescent assay) of DENV were described in bats from DENV-endemic islands in China.14 Seroconversion in bats (DENV-1, -2, and -3) has been reported in urban areas in Costa Rica and Ecuador.15 Bats captured during a dengue fever outbreak along the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of Mexico were found to beDENV-seropositive (enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay [ELISA]), have DENV NS1 protein, and be positive on reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR for DENV-2.16 Molecular evidence of DENV-1, -2, and -3 in bats from French Guiana was reported, including a phylogenetic sequence from a Carollia perspicillata bat consistent with DENV-1.7 Qualita- tive detection of the NS1 antigen of DENVs in bat serum samples and plaque reduction neutralization tests has been reported in bats from southeasternMexico from disturbed sites near human settlements in Campeche (S. Cabrera-Romo and others, unpublished data) and Mérida,17 which is the largest city in the Yucatan Peninsula. In this study, samples were collected from bats trapped in two biosphere reserves located in southeastern Mexico. High bat diversity and large tracts of continuous forest characterize these areas. Additionally, DENV-1, -2, and -4 have been reported in human populations. The aim of this study was to show the presence of DENV serotypes in bats within the biosphere reserves and adjacent areas with anthropogenic changes using RT-PCR. Bats were collected in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (Chiapas; 16 °9¢46² N, 90 °41¢18² W) and Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (Campeche; 18°26¢1² N, 89°36¢61² W) from two landscape types categorized as undis- turbed forest (UD), comprised of primary forest with no human disturbance, and disturbed forest (D), defined as a transitional zone between primary forest and agricultural/ livestock areas or human settlements. In both regions, the sites were located at least 20 km from significant human populations where dengue has been reported (Xpujil in Campeche State and Benemérito de la Américas in Chiapas State). Bats were *Address correspondence to Jesús Sotomayor-Bonilla, Universidad 3000, Colonia Ciudad Universitaria, México, Distrito Federal, Mexico 03310.

Each site was sampled three times between November of 2010 and August of 2011. Field guides were used for the taxonomic species identification of all bats captured.18 In total, 146 bats were euthanized following the Guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists for the Use of Wild Mammals in Research19 with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Subcommittee of the Veterinary Fac- ulty of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. One hun- dred forty-six spleen specimens were collected and preserved in liquid nitrogen, and RNA from all samples was extracted using TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was carried out for DENV (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) as described previously using highly specific and sensitive primers.20 The DENV-positive control strains used in the RT-PCR for DENVs (D1/AO/XX/1988 Angola, D2/CR/ 13538/2007 Limón, D3/CR/14532/2007 Corredores, and D4/ DM/814669/1981 Dominica) were donated by the Dengue Reference Center, Instituto Costarricense de Investigación y Enseñanza en Nutrición y Salud (INCIENSA; Costa Rica). Nuclease-free water was used as a negative control. RT-PCR products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with Gel Red (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). Pos- itive and negative controls resulted as expected. Samples from 16 bat species were analyzed. Six DENV-2– positive bats were detected (prevalence of 4.1%; 95% confi- dence interval ± 3.22) (Table 1). In Calakmul, four bats were PCR-positive: two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus. Two bats, G. soricina and A. jamaicensis, were captured in the UD sites, and two bats, G. soricina and A. lituratus, were captured in a D site. In Montes Azules, two A. lituratus were positive to DENV-2: one bat from a UD site and one bat from a D site. These three bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) are considered highly abundant bat species in the Mexican Neo- tropics,21–23 coinciding with the relative abundance found in this study (A. lituratus: 179 [22%]; G. soricina: 118 [14.5%]; and A. jamaicensis: 111 [13.6%]). No significant difference was detected comparing the presence of DENV-2 and the type of site (UD and D) using a test of equal or given propor- tions in R24 (c2 = 0.1738, degrees of freedom = 1, P = 0.6768). This preliminary study provides additional evidence of DENV exposure in Neotropical bats.7,15–17 Unfortunately, because of sample degradation, we could not amplify a differ- ent region of the viral genome for phylogenetic analysis from the positive samples. Although DENV infection was sero- logically recognized in 26 bats of the same three species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) from Merida City,17 this detection is the first detection of the DENV-2 genome by molecular diagnostic methods in bats from south- eastern Mexico. DENV-1, -2, and -3 have been reported in bats from French Guiana by RT-PCR, where DENV was found in A. planirostris and C. perspicillata.7 Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, DENV-2 was identified in Myotis nigricans, Carollia sowelli, andA. jamaicensis.16 However, this detection is the first molecular detection of the DENV-2 genome in A. lituratus and G. soricina. Old World DENV-2 strains diverged relatively recently and spread to the Neotropics by human carriers and the transpor- tation of infected monkeys and mosquitoes.5 The encroach- ment of human settlements and agricultural areas on UD areas could promote new interactions among DENV vectors and potential hosts, increasing the possible development of sylvatic DENV.5 Large-scale research of anthropogenic change and pathogen evolution using an epidemiologic framework is vital to develop comprehensive policies across public health, economic development, and conservation biology.5 This study adds additional evidence for the presence of DENV-2 in three bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina). However, the extent to which bats are involved in DENV transmission and their ability to act as competent hosts remain undetermined. Because these species are the three most abundant species in the region, we may be seeing random spillover into dead-end hosts. Understanding the ecology of DENV in bats is important before implicating bats as a threat to public health. Sylvatic DENV in any species could evolve from biological interactions between wild reser- voirs and sylvatic vectors.5,7 Lastly, it may arise from socio- economic factors, such as human encroachment into natural areas in locations where medical and health services are absent.25 Future investigations of DENV in Neotropical bats and other potential wild reservoirs will improve the under- standing of the ecological dynamics of these viruses in nature.

Emergence and establishment of Usutu virus infection in wild and captive avian species in and around Zurich, Switzerland-Genomic and pathologic comparison to other central European outbreaks Abstract In late summer 2006 considerable mortality in wild and captive Passeriformes and Strigiformes was observed in Zurich, Switzerland. All animals were found in a range of 2km(2). Observed clinical signs involved depression, ruffled plumage, incoordination, seizures and peracute death. Nutritional status was generally moderate to poor in wild birds, and variable in captive animals. Necropsy showed marked splenomegaly, a mild hepatomegaly, and pulmonary hyperemia in most animals. Histopathologic lesions were very discrete and consisted mainly of neuronal necrosis, leucocytolysis in and around the brain blood vessels, and miliary liver necrosis.

All animals were found in a range of 2 km2. Observed clinical signs involved depression, ruffled plumage, incoordination, seizures and peracute death. Nutritional status was generally moderate to poor in wild birds, and variable in captive animals. Necropsy showed marked splenomegaly, a mild hepatomegaly, and pulmonary hyperemia in most animals. Histopathologic lesions were very discrete and consisted mainly of neuronal necrosis, leucocytolysis in and around the brain blood vessels, and miliary liver necrosis. The diagnosis of an Usutu virus (USUV) infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Partial nucleotide sequence comparisons revealed >99% identity between the viruses that emerged in Zurich in 2006, in Vienna in 2001, and in Budapest in 2005. Since 2008 a significant lower mortality was observed in wild Passeriformes, but USUV infection was confirmed for the first time beyond Zurich city limits.

Key words: USUV, Passeriformes, Strigiformes, Switzerland, herd immunity, house sparrow, blackbirds, ectoparasites STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 4 INTRODUCTION Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which was first isolated from Culex naevei in South Africa in 1959 (Williams et al. 1964). Within the first documented emergence of USUV outside Africa, it caused fatalities in birds, especially in wild blackbirds (Turdus merula) and captive great grey owls (Strix nebulosa) in the region of Vienna, Austria, between 2001 and 2005 (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Weissenböck et al. 2003, Chvala et al. 2004). Subsequently the virus spread to Hungary (Bakonyi et al. 2007) and Italy (Manarolla et al. 2010), and caused outbreaks in free and captive wild bird populations. Although closely related to important human pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, human disease unequivocally caused by USUV has not been reported previously; although USUV was isolated from a patient with fever and rash in Africa (Digoutte and Adam 2007), and viral RNA was detected in a patient with rash in Austria (Weissenbock et al. 2007). Recent reports, however, described a neuroinvasive USUV infection in a patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Pecorari et al. 2009), and another neuroinvasive case in a patient who received an orthotropic liver transplant (Cavrini et al. 2009). Both cases occurred in Italy, in late summer, 2009. Pathogenicity of USUV in avian species varies. While domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) (Chvala et al. 2005) and domestic geese (Anser anser f. domestica) (Chvala et al. 2006) seem to be resistant to USUV infection, especially blackbirds and owls were severely affected in the Austrian outbreak (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Weissenböck et al. 2003). Pathologic alterations consisted of macroscopic enlarged liver and spleen, and histological of necrotizing hepatitis, myocardial degeneration, and neuronal necrosis (Weissenböck et al. 2003). Complete genome analysis and comparisons of the reference strain of the South Africa USUV and the Austrian isolates exhibited 97% nucleotide and 99% amino acid identity (Bakonyi et al. 2004). STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 5 From the end of July through mid September 2006, considerable, acute mortality in wild and captive Passeriformes and Strigiformes was observed around Zurich Zoo, Switzerland. Investigations determined Usutu virus as the causative agent. Since then the virus caused a significant mortality in captive Strigiformes during late summer month every year. In view of the spread of USUV through Central Europe, the aims of the present study were (i) to describe clinical and pathological findings in affected avian species on the basis of the situation in Switzerland, and (ii) to compare pathological alterations, the genomic structure and the disease epidemiology in Switzerland to the Austrian emergence. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical History From the end of July through mid-September 2006 a considerable mortality in wild and captive Passeriformes and Strigiformes was observed around Zurich Zoo, Switzerland. All animals were found within a range of 2 km2. Blood was collected in six captive Strigiformes from the right jugular vein for haematology and blood chemistry one to two days before death. The samples were analyzed within six hours at a clinical laboratory (Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich). Cloacal swabs were collected from dead and sick birds to test for avian influenza. Swabs were placed in Viral Culturette™ tubes (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, USA) and were analyzed within 24 hours of collection according to described procedures at the Reference Laboratory, Institute for Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zürich (Dalessi et al. 2007). Blood was assayed for Newcastle Disease Virus antibodies using an haemagglutination-inhibition test (Wunderwald and Hoop 2002). STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 6 Due to the results of the pathological and virological analysis and an epidemiological evaluation, all Strigiformes at Zurich Zoo born or acquired after October 2006 were housed indoors from July to September every year. Again from mid August to the end of September 2007, an increased number of dying wild Passeriformes were observed in the vincinity of Zurich Zoo. Found carcasses in moderate to good postmortem condition were send for necropsy and further virological analysis. In addition, one blackbird which was found dead 15 km outside the zoo grounds was included in the study because the animal was observed showing clinical signs (incoordination) indicating USUV infection before death. While in 2008 no suspicious USUV-associated avian case was detected at Zurich Zoo, in 2009, between July and September, captive Strigiformes and wild Passeriformes died either acutely or were seen with neurological disturbances at Zurich Zoo. After the recognition of the increased mortality in Strigiformes remaining animals were treated for ectoparasites and transferred to indoor housing until end of September. Climatic factors were measured at the weather station Zürich Fluntern, of the Swiss Weather Service and included: monthly mean air temperature in centigrade and monthly sum of rainfall from January 2000 until December 2009. Climatic factors during the last ten years were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). It was assumed that data from each sample were normally distributed and that each sample had the same variance, the latter were tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Hartley Fmax-Test, respectively. Pathology Necropsies were performed either at the Institute of Animal Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland or the Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland between 6 h to 48 h after the animal’s death. STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 7 Tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for histopathology or immunohistochemistry and, in addition, frozen tissue samples (brain and parenchymal organs) were stored at -40°C for further investigations. After embedding in paraffin wax, 4-!m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Besides all affected wild birds and captive Strigiformes, all birds were involved in the histopathological study that died within the collection of Zurich Zoo during July and September of each year. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 4-!m paraffin wax section as described previously (Chvala et al. 2004). The avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique (Weissenböck et al. 1998) and a mouse West-Nile virus (WNV) antiserum were used to identify flavivirus-infected birds. Positive controls consisted of brain sections of WNV-infected and USUV-infected birds, in which the diagnosis had been confirmed by in-situ hybridization (ISH) and sequencing of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification product. In-situ hybridization was used to identify the presence and distribution of USUV-specific nucleotide sequences according the previously described technique (Chvala et al. 2004). Positive controls consisted of brain sections of USUV-infected birds, in which the diagnosis had been confirmed by sequencing of an RT-PCR amplification product. Negative controls consisted of brain sections of WNV-infected birds. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and genomic analysis Bird organ samples (mainly brain, but occasionally also spleen, liver, kidney, gut, heart or lung) were homogenized in ceramic mortars with sterile quartz sand and suspended (approx. 50 w/v%) in DEPC-treated distilled water. The suspensions were centrifuged at 4,300 ""g for 10 minutes and viral RNA was extracted from 140 !l of the supernatants using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCRs were STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 8 performed on the sample RNAs using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each 25 µl reaction mixture contained 5 µl of 5 "" buffer (final MgCl2 concentration 2.5 mM), 0.4 mM of dNTP, 10 U RNasin! RNase Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.8 !M of the appropriate forward and reverse primers, 1 µl of enzyme mix (containing reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase) and 2.5 µl of template RNA. The oligonucleotide primer pairs Usu 1155f-1600r, Usu 1537f-2505r, Usu 2328f-3145r, Usu 9170f-9704r, WNV 9031f- 10091r, and WNV 10090f-10807r (Bakonyi et al. 2004) were used for the detection of WNV RNA in the sample materials. Following reverse transcription (30 min at 50°C and 15 min at 95°C), reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 repetitive cycles of polymerase chain reaction (40 s at 94°C, 50 s at 57°C, and 1 min at 72°C). Reactions were completed by incubation at 72°C for 10 minutes, and 10 !l of the samples were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel. Ethidium-bromide stained gels were visualized under UV light. The nucleotide sequences of selected amplification products were determined by fluorescence- based direct sequencing method; the sequences were aligned to the complete genome sequences of the USUV strains SAAR-1776, Vienna-2001-blackbird, and Budapest-2005-blackbird (Bakonyi et al. 2004). Sequences of the reference strains are deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers AY453411, AY453412 and EF206350. RESULTS Clinical History Between July 25th and September 20th, 2006 a total of 113 birds (24 captive and 89 wild birds) died acutely at Zurich Zoo, Switzerland and post mortems including further examinations were STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 9 performed. Most animals were found dead (n = 94) or were euthanized (19) in extremis during this time. Most affect species were from the order of Passeriformes (91) and Strigiformes (10) (Table 1). The observed clinical signs in wild Passeriformes involved depression, ruffled plumage, incoordination, seizures, and peracute death. Hematology and blood chemistry values were within reference ranges (ISIS 2002) in five Strigiformes. One pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum passerinum) had a mild leucocytosis ( ??) compared to reference values (ISIS 2002). All animals were found in a range of 2km2. Though information of state veterinarians and several press announcements were released, no other abnormal die off of wild or captive Passeriformes or Strigiformes in Switzerland was observed. The following year, from mid August to the end of September, a total of 44 wild Passeriformes were found dead on Zoo grounds. In addition four captive Strigiformes were euthanized due to injuries and severe dyspnea during this time. Three Strigiformes and found carcasses of wild birds, in moderate to good post-mortem condition (20), were suspicious for USUV infection at necropsy (Table 1). Neurological signs in wild or captive birds at Zurich Zoo were not observed in autumn 2007. But one blackbird was observed with incoordination 15 km outside the zoo grounds. The bird died during transport by a private person to the veterinary clinic. While in 2008 neither Zurich Zoo nor the University of Zurich found a suspicious case of USUV infection in any captive or wild avian species, in August 2009 three acute deaths suspicious for USUV infection occurred in captive Strigiformes at Zurich Zoo. As a consequence, all remaining captive Strigiformes were again treated for ectoparasites and transferred to indoor housing units. No obvious die off in wild avian species was observed. Climatic conditions were not significant different between seasons and years over the last ten years (p >.0.05), although a slight increase in average temperature and decrease in rainfall was observed (Figure 1). STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 10 Pathology In total, 149 animals were examined histopathologically, consisting of birds from the orders of Passeriformes (74), Strigiformes (21), Anseriformes (27), Ciconiiformes (6), Galliformes (11), Piciformes (1), Psittacidae (1), Coraciformes (2), Trogoniformes (1) and Phoenicopteriformes (5). Examined birds were in acceptable to good post-mortem condition. Forty nine percent (73) of investigated animals had typical pathological lesions for USUV infections described previously (Weissenböck et al. 2002). The nutritional status was generally moderate to poor in wild birds, and poor to good in captive animals. Necropsy revealed a marked splenomegaly, a slightly swollen liver, and hyperemic lungs in most animals (Figure 2). While all affected wild birds (61) were within the order of Passeriformes, confirmed USUV infections in captive birds (12) were found exclusively in the order of Strigiformes. None of the other orders showed typical lesions indicative for USUV infection. Histopathologic lesions were very discrete and consisted mainly of neuronal necrosis, leucocytolysis in and around the brain blood vessels, and miliary necroses in the liver. Additionally, scattered cellular necrosis associated with minimal inflammatory reaction was frequently observed in heart muscle tissue, and rarely in kidneys and spleen (Figure 3). No avian influenza or Newcastle disease virus was found in any bird. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and genomic analyzes The diagnosis ‘USUV infection’ was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR with WNV specific primers and ISH with a WNV-specific probe were negative in all analyzed samples. All USUV positive animals were within the order of Passeriformes and Strigiformes. STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 11 The nucleotide (nt.) sequences of selected amplification products were determined and compared to the Austrian (blackbird 2001), Hungarian (blackbird 2005) and South-African (SAAR 1776) strains’ sequences. Within the E protein coding region (between nt. positions 1175 and 2490) the nucleotide sequence of the Zurich 2006 virus differed in one nucleotide from the other three investigated sequences. (At nt. position 1524 of the complete USUV genomes a T is found, which was substituted to C in the Zurich strain.) In the NS5 protein coding region (between nt. positions 9170-9704) two substitutions were identified: at nt. position 9549 the Austrian and Hungarian strains contain T, while the South-African and Swiss (2006) viruses have C in this locus. In position 9669 the Zurich (2006) viruses nucleotide T differed from the other three sequences (C). The third investigated genome section was the partial NS5 and 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR), between nt. positions 10128 and 10736. In position 10289 the Swiss viruses from 2006 and 2009 contain T, while the other three viruses have C. In position 10311 the Vienna 2001 contains A, the other investigated viruses contain G. In position 10374 the Zurich 2009 virus contains C, while the others (including Zurich 2006) have T. All these substitutions are transitions and none of them changed the putative amino acid sequence of the precursor polypeptide (Table 2). DISCUSSION The current study documents the spread and maintenance of USUV in Central Europe. It appears that this mosquito-borne flavivirus, which had never been observed outside tropical and subtropical Africa until the Austrian outbreak in 2001 (Weissenböck et al. 2003), is affecting the native avian populations of Central Europe. Comparisons of pathologic alterations revealed similar lesions between the Austrian, Hungarian, Italian and the Swiss USUV emergence. Supported by partial nucleotide sequence analysis with >99% identity between the viruses which STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 12 emerged in Zurich in 2006, in Vienna in 2001, in Budapest in 2005, and in Milan 2006 it is suspected that a particular strain of USUV is spreading in central Europe. The major clinical and pathological findings were comparable in all Central European locations. Clinical symptoms are rarely described in previous studies due to the fast disease process. Affected birds with confirmed USUV infection showed similar unspecific clinical signs with neurological disturbances suspicious for an encephalitis shortly before death. Nevertheless, animals must have suffered from the disease for several days, because most animals were in a compromised nutritional status when found at a time when food resources for wild Passeriformes seem unlimited in affected locations. Therefore, neurological sings and / or sudden death with pathological findings such as hepato- and splenomegaly, neuronal necrosis, and necrotic changes in liver and heart are indicative to consider USUV infection. Often, however, not all of the lesions mentioned above are present and diagnosis requires confirmation by the demonstration of USUV, either by conventional or molecular virological methods or by the detection of viral signals within tissue sections. In particular, ISH with a USUV-specific probe is an excellent confirmatory tool as it has been already proven in previous studies (Chvala et al. 2004). With regard to lesions and viral distribution in tissues, the findings largely corresponded to those in birds in the previous USUV outbreaks (Bakonyi et al. 2004, Chvala et al. 2004). Minor differences were observed in affected species. While in the Austrian outbreak more blackbirds were dying of USUV infection, house sparrows were the most affected species in the Swiss emergence. However, in general it seems that USUV infections are a great concern in Passeriformes and Strigiformes while previous studies have shown that USUV is of limited pathogenity in the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) and geese (Anser anser f. domestica) (Chvala et al. 2005, Chvala et al. 2006). If captive, exotic Passeriformes are as sensible to USUV STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 13 as the domestic house sparrow is unknown, especially since most of these exotic birds were housed indoors with less contact to the transmitting vectors. Current USUV outbreaks seem to be strongly limited on selective locations in Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Switzerland (Dorrestein et al. 2007, Manarolla et al. 2009). Furthermore, a serological study suggests exposure of wild, nonmigratory birds in the United Kingdom to this virus as well (Buckley et al. 2003, Buckley et al. 2006). Recently specific RNA sequences of another USUV strain were detected in a pool of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, which were collected in Spain; however, USUV-associated avian mortality was not reported in the country (Busquets et al. 2008). It appears that zoological facilities have an important role in the detection of USUV infection. Similarly to the Austrian and Italian USUV outbreak (Weissenböck et al. 2002), the emergence of USUV in Switzerland was first recognized in a zoological facility. Zoological facilities with their intensive health surveillance program and personnel trained to observe animals for clinical signs of disease have proven to be of major importance in the early detection of emerging diseases, including spongiform encephalopathies and West Nile virus (Kirkwood and Cunningham 1994, Steele et al. 2000). Vulnerable collections, a wide variety of species from different habitats, and the preventative health management can be an exceptional combination for animal health surveillance as well as for early detection of emerging diseases and zoonoses. In addition, avian carcasses seem to disappear quickly in the wild. In the Austrian outbreak most birds were mainly found in urban areas in Vienna, in gardens or parks, rather than in the natural environment. Similar in Italy, USUV infections were only diagnosed within the collection of a private owl breeder (Manarolla et al. 2009). In Switzerland, almost all affected birds were found within Zurich zoo. It seems reasonable that USUV is also present outside these well defined grounds, but local wildlife, e.g. red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and domestic predators, e.g. cat (Felis STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 14 catus), will probably use the affected dead birds as an easy food source and carcasses remain undetected. Various theories are discussed for the emergence of USUV in the different locations in Europe. Whether a virulent USUV strain was introduced either via importation of infected birds, by migratory birds, or increased international travel activities and thus by importation of infective vectors, remains hypothetic. It seems rather unlikely that the virus was introduced by migratory birds every year. Comparison of the sequences of the European and the South African USUV strains revealed that with 95% amino acid identity there was sufficient differences in specific amino acid substitutions to conclude that these viruses have evolved independently (Weissenböck et al. 2002), while the Central European strains seem to be closely related to each other and share 99% amino acid identity. It appears reasonable to assume that the USUV has been introduced to the region of Vienna from Africa once, and has established an efficient transmission cycle between local bird and mosquito species since then (Meister et al. 2008). In recent years the USUV is now slowly radiating to neighbouring federal states and countries. It seems that the strains present in Switzerland, Italy, Hungary, and Austria, however, are highly pathogenic and affected areas are extending after some years of rest. The current climatic conditions in Europe, with unusual mild winters, might be of special epidemiologic interest if the virus might accelerate its spread though Europe causing higher avian mortalities in the future. How the virus strain is spreading through Europe or even has been introduced to Europe is, however, still unknown. Remarkably, since USUV appeared in Europe the virus was always found around larger western cities with major international trade activities and important airports. If the introduction of this exotic virus to the different locations was facilitated by human travel activity or by animal trade, or whether disease surveillance in these areas is simply superior (as discussed above), needs to be determined. STEINMETZ ET AL. – USUTU VIRUS SPREADS IN CENTRAL EUROPE 15 In current European locations with USUV activity, avian mortality decreased within a year. In addition, it seems that the preventative health plan for the captive Strigiformes protected the remaining collection and additions from acute disease and reduced mortalities until 2009, when the Strigiforme collection was again housed outdoors during late summer months as before in 2006. It seems important to find out how a safe USUV immunity can be established in a limited number of captive Strigiformes - especially since mortalities in free-ranging Passeriformes were reduced significantly over the years since 2006. The reason remains currently unknown. However, experience from the well documented Austrian USUV outbreak (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Weissenböck et al. 2003, Chvala et al. 2004, Chvala et al. 2007) indicates that virus and avian host immune system adapt well to each other and a high degree of overall immunity in the affected populations of susceptible host species (“flock immunity”) seems to develop over time. As a result, the infections are clinically inapparent and avian mortality and pathological changes do not usually occur in previously exposed individuals (Endy and Nisalak 2002, Malkinson et al. 2002, Buckley et al. 2003). Therefore, indoor housing seems to prevent captive animals from acute USUV-associated death, but also might prevent the development of flock immunity in threatened species. Experience from the Swiss outbreak suggest to house young of the year and additions indoors during the first two seasons of USUV activity. The following years a regular treatment against ectoparasites might help to reduce virus transmittance below the minimal virus concentration and minimal exposure might induce protective immunity against virulent infections in a range of bird species. A vaccination is currently unavailable and the idea that another flavivirus vaccine, like the West-Nile-Virus vaccine, induces a cross protection against USUV seems rather unlikely, especially since the established equine WNV vaccine resulted in variable protection in various bird species (Johnso"
Suss-2007-Tickborne encephalitis in naturally.pdf	"Dispatches.indd Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 905 Tickborne Encephalitis in Naturally Exposed Monkey (Macaca sylvanus) Jochen Süss,* Ellen Gelpi,*† Christine Klaus,* Audrey Bagon,* Elisabeth M. Liebler-Tenorio,* Herbert Budka,*† Bernhard Stark,*‡ Werner Müller,*§ and Helmut Hotzel* We describe tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in a monkey (Macaca sylvanus) after natural exposure in an area at risk for TBE. TBE virus was present in the brain and could be identifi ed as closely related to the European subtype, strain Neudoerfl . Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a zoonotic disease caused by TBE virus (TBEV), a fl avivirus. There are 3 subtypes of TBEV, the European subtype, transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes ricinus, and the Far Eastern and Siberian subtypes. Except in Austria, where mass vaccina- tion campaigns were organized, the incidence of TBE in humans has increased in the past 30 years in all European countries with regions with risk for the disease. The aver- age increase of TBE in 10 European countries was 311% from 1974–1983 to 1994–2003 (1,2). In Germany TBE in- cidence has increased enormously during recent years. Most TBE group viruses use rodents as maintenance and amplifying hosts. TBE is predominately reported in hu- mans, seldom in dogs and horses, and is as yet unknown in monkeys.The clinical progress of TBE is typically biphasic. In humans, a nonspecifi c infl uenzalike illness develops as the fi rst phase of illness 7-14 days after they are bitten by a TBEV-positive tick. A second phase, with central nervous system involvement, develops in ≈30% of patients. Initial signs and symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, and radiculitis. The case-fatality rate is 1%–2% in central Eu- rope and 20%–40% in Siberia and the Far East. The Study On July 14, 2006, staggering paresis of the hind legs, incoordination, and intermittent opisthotonos developed in a female barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus). No nystag- mus was present. The monkey, born April 27, 2005, was from a group of ≈200 animals living in 3 social groups. The animals were kept in a large, outdoor enclosure of a monkey park situated in a TBE-risk area in southern Ger- many. Four days after the onset of clinical signs, the animal became comatose and was euthanized. Blood was collected before euthanasia, and serum was prepared. At necropsy, no macroscopic lesions were observed. The brain was removed and immediately frozen on dry ice and sectioned in 2-cm slices. Alternating slices were placed in 3.5% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C. After 48 h, rep- resentative areas, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, were embedded in paraffi n. Sections (3–5 μm) were cut from each block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for standard histopathologic evalua- tion. For immunohistochemical detection of TBEV antigens, a noncommercial rabbit polyclonal hyperimmune serum (di- lution 1:1,000) was used as described previously (3). Histologic examination of the brain tissue could be satisfactorily performed despite moderate artifacts caused by freezing (Figure, Panel A). Moderate perivascular in- fl ammatory cuffs and slight diffuse infi ltration of brain pa- renchyma by mononuclear cells were observed in almost all brain areas, including basal ganglia and cerebellum (Figure, Panel B). In addition, slight mononuclear infl am- matory infi ltrates were present in the meninges. Microglial nodules were not detected. Immunohistochemical testing demonstrated several anti-TBEV immunoreactive neurons and processes, mainly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex (Figure, Panel B), and to a lesser extent in pyrami- dal neurons of the temporal cortex. Single neuronophagias were also observed. From the frozen material, 10 samples of brain tissue were selected for PCR analysis, including cerebrum, cer- ebellum, and brain stem (Table). Viral RNA was extracted from brain tissue with RNeasy Kit and from cerebrospinal fl uid with QIAamp Viral Kit (both from QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The brain tissue was homogenized by bead- milling (Retsch, Haan, Germany) with 3-mm stainless steel beads in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer, and the QIAshredder sys- tem (QIAGEN) was used to improve homogenization. A modifi ed nested reverse transcription–PCR (nRT-PCR) was conducted with primer pairs Pp1, Pm1 (reverse transcrip- tion and fi rst PCR), and Pp2, Pm2 (nested PCR) (4). Am- plifi cation was done in a 50-μL reaction volume containing 10 μL 5× buffer, 2 μL deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (10 mmol/L), 2 μL enzyme mix (all from QIAGEN), 2 μL RNase inhibitor (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), 1.25 μL primers Pp1 and Pm1 (20 pmol/μL; Jena-Bioscience, Jena, Germany), 27.5 μL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)–treated water, and 4 μL RNA extract. The reaction was performed in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) thermal cycler for 30 min at 60°C for RT and 15 min at 95°C for denaturation as the initial step, followed by 40 cycles of PCR with 30 s *Friedrich-Loeffl er-Institute, Jena, Germany; †Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; ‡Affenberg Salem, Bodensee, Germany; and §Labor ALOMED, Radolfzell, Germany DISPATCHES 906 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 at 94°C, 30 s at 66°C, and 1 min at 72°C. Final extension was 10 min at 72°C. The second amplifi cation reaction was carried out with 4 μL of amplifi cation product in a 50-μL reaction (25 μL Taq PCR Master Mix [QIAGEN], 1.25 μL of each primer Pp2 and Pm2 [20 pmol/μL], and 18.5 μL DEPC-treated wa- ter). After a denaturation step of 2 min at 95°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C and 30 s at 65°C were performed, followed by 10 min at 72°C. PCR products (178 bp) were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and ethid- ium bromide staining. Bands were cut out, and DNA was extracted by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIA- GEN). DNA sequencing was conducted by cycle sequenc- ing, using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplifi cation primers Pp2 and Pm2 were also used as sequencing primers. Nucleotide sequences were determined on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Six of the10 brain samples were positive and CSF was negative for TBEV by nRT-PCR (Table). The sequences of these 6 PCR products (178 bp) differed by only 1 nt from that of strain Neudoerfl , the prototype strain of the Euro- pean virus subtype. The serum was tested for whole specifi c TBE antibod- ies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and IgM) by ELISA (5). Solid- phase bound antigen and antigen conjugate were from a commercially available test kit (Immunozym FSME, Pro- gen, Heidelberg, Germany). As standards, negative and positive test serum samples were used, and the following limit values were defi ned: <5 U/L, negative; 5–7 U/L, bor- der line; 9–14 U/L, weakly positive; >14 U/L, positive; and >50 U/L, strongly positive. The serum of the macaque de- scribed in this paper was positive for specifi c TBE antibod- ies (24 U/L) Conclusions Experimental infections of macaques with TBEV and related fl aviviruses (Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Powas- san virus) have been reported (6–8), but natural infections with TBE virus have not been reported previously. In our case, clinical signs, neuropathologic fi ndings, and immuno- histochemical detection of TBEV antigen in neurons and of TBEV by nRT-PCR indicate that the macaque succumbed to natural TBEV infection.

Tickborne Encephalitis in Naturally Exposed Monkey Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 907 nodular pattern of lesions in the brain was not observed, the distribution of viral antigens was comparable to that observed in fatal human TBEV infection with a short clini- cal course. The TBEV was characterized as closely related to the European prototype strain Neudoerfl , which suggests that the infection was acquired locally by infected ticks. This fact is surprising because macaques generally quickly remove ticks during social grooming. The monkey park where the animal became infected is situated in southern Germany, close to the Bodensee (Bodenseekreis). This area, fl anked on the west by an area at high risk for TBE (Kreis Konstanz), is also at risk for TBE. From 1999 to 2006, a total of 29 autochthonous clini- cal cases of TBE in humans were reported in the Bodens- eekreis and 35 in the Kreis Konstanz (Hellenbrand W., pers. comm.); 19% of unvaccinated forestry workers in the Bodenseekreis and 15% in the Kreis Konstanz were sero- positive for TBEV (9). The prevalence of TBEV in ticks was 1.2%–2.3% in the Bodenseekreis (10). Retrospective analyses of anamnestic data from the affected monkey park show that TBE may have appeared sporadically in macaques in the past. A monkey died in September 1995 and another in May 2006, and TBEV anti- gen was subsequently detected in brain tissue from the fi rst animal and antibodies to TBEV were detected in both ani- mals (12 U/L and 46 U/L, respectively, by ELISA). These 2 cases have not been systematically evaluated. Clinical signs of encephalitis were observed in another animal in 1999, but it seroconverted (42 U/L, ELISA test) and re- covered after 2 months. Thus, TBE should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of encephalitis in mon- keys kept outdoors in areas at risk for TBE. Further sero- epidemiologic studies are planned to determine the status of TBEV infection among animals in this German monkey park. Vaccination against TBEV should be an option to protect other macaques in the group. Acknowledgments We are grateful to Angela Dramburg and Sabine Lied for skillful technical assistance.

It is also important n the Far East and in other parts of Asia. Vaccination can effec- ively prevent TBE. Protective vaccination is indicated for persons nhabiting or visiting TBE areas who have an increased risk of tick ites. For this purpose, it is necessary to know where TBE virus ccurs, where vectors are a potential hazard, and where as a con- equence autochthonous TBE cases have been registered. Unlike yme borreliosis endemic regions, TBE risk areas are distributed in a atchwork pattern, sometimes the situation remains stable, some- imes changes occur due to altered climatic conditions or other actors. This review is an update of an earlier one on the same topic Süss, 2003). The principal vectors of TBE virus (TBEV) are the hard ticks Ixodes icinus and I. persulcatus. I. ricinus has the primary role as a vec- or of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus of TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib which epresent different subtypes of TBEV.

In China, TBEV has been isolated from H. concinna and I. ovatus. Zoonotic tick-borne diseases are an increasing health burden in Europe, and there is speculation that this is partly due to cli- mate changes affecting vector biology and pathogen transmission (Gray et al., 2009). Currently, individual aspects of tick activity (Gray, 2008) and distribution (Danielová et al., 2008) as well as the distribution of risk areas (Danielová et al., 2010) suggest an influ- ence of the climate. The remarkably high host seeking activity of I. ricinus in Berlin, Germany, in the winter 2006/07 was probably due to a very mild winter (Dautel et al., 2008), and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers might change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the later part of the year (Gray, 2008). However, the nature and significance of climate change effects on the components of TBEV ecology have not yet been fully determined. It has been reported that ticks (I. ricinus) and TBEV reach higher altitudes in the mountains, higher than in former years between 1970 and 1980 (Danielová et al., 2006; Materna et al., 2008; Daniel et al., 2008a; Holzmann et al., 2009), and spread north in Sweden (Lindgren et al., 2000; Lindgren and Jaenson, 2006; Eisen, 2008), Norway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Finland (Jääskeläinen et al., 2006), Germany (Hemmer et al., 2005; Süss et al., 2008a) and west in Austria (Holzmann et al., 2009).

However, there are authors who dispute the influence of cli- ate change on TBE risk areas based on the current state of nowledge (Korenberg, 2009) or hold other factors (political and ociological changes and human behaviour which influenced the ick bite exposure of humans, vaccination acceptance) responsible or the increase (or decrease) in TBE incidence (and/or distribu- ion) (Randolph, 2008; Šumilo et al., 2007, 2008a,b; Süss et al., 008b). Randolph and Rogers (2000) predicted that the expected ummer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture might pro- ressively drive the distribution of TBEV (Ixodes ticks) into higher atitude and higher-altitude regions through the 2020s, 2050s, and 080s. When previously undescribed risk areas are detected, it is often ard to decide whether these areas had already existed previously nd remained undetected due to the absence of humans or whether hey have developed recently. Risk areas can be very large, but hey can also be extremely small and contain special TBEV variants Kupča et al., 2010). The epidemiological knowledge of TBE should be updated from ime to time to provide a solid basis for recommendations with egard to protective vaccination. For an understanding of the eco-epidemiology of TBEV, some asic facts about the biology and ecology of the virus are first pre- ented. BE virus classification Taxonomically, TBE viruses belong to the tick-borne viruses ithin the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae (Fauquet et al., 005). Most members of this virus genus are arthropod-borne. The osquito-borne virus group of the genus Flavivirus includes medi- ally important viruses such as Yellow fever virus, the 4 serotypes f Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. he group of tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprises 12 virus pecies divided into 2 groups, mammalian and seabird group. In he mammalian group, TBEV, but also the louping ill virus and the owassan virus (POWV) as well as the closely related deer tick virus ause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. The Kyasanur for- st disease virus and the closely related Alkhurma virus as well as he Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus, which have also been classi- ed into this group, cause severe haemorrhagic disease in humans. one of the other members of the virus group affecting mammals, uch as the Kadam virus and the Royal farm virus, cause human iseases and neither do the members of the sea bird virus group Hubálek and Halouzka, 1996; Süss and Schrader, 2004; Gould and olomon, 2008). TBEV occurs in 3 subtypes, the European virus (previously CEE irus, Central European encephalitis virus, TBEV-Eu), the Far East- rn virus (previously RSSE virus, TBEV-Fe), and the Siberian virus previously west Siberian virus, TBEV-Sib). TBEV-Eu is closely asso- iated with I. ricinus and TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib with I. persulcatus. ccording to Ecker et al. (1999), variation in amino acids within subtype is up to 2% and between subtypes 5–6% (Lindquist and apalahti, 2008). All data gathered so far indicate that immunization of persons n clinical trials with a vaccine based on the European subtype virus strains Neudoerfl or K23) showed cross-protection against he other 2 subtypes (Holzmann et al., 1992; Hayasaka et al., 2001; akashima et al., 2001). TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe, borne by I. persulcatus ticks, are mono- hyletic (Tonteri et al., 2011). The diversity of the 2 TBEV species arried by I. persulcatus is much higher than for TBEV-Eu and has robably been evolving for thousands of years, whereas TBEV-Eu Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 3 strains in I. ricinus are very similar, do not show clear geographic clustering (i.e. strains within a given region do not form genetic groups) and occur in most TBE-endemic countries (Kuno et al., 1998; Haglund et al., 2003; Han et al., 2005; Jääskeläinen et al., 2006; Grard et al., 2007; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008). Recently, Jääskeläinen et al. (2010a) isolated TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe strains from I. persulcatus collected in the Republics of Karelia and Buryatia, respectively. TBEV-Eu, louping ill virus, and other flaviviruses transmitted mainly by I. ricinus are closely related to each other. Inexact diag- nostics for these closely related viruses can cause problems insofar as apparent detections of TBEV may really be detection of louping ill virus. This could be the case, for example, in Denmark and Norway where louping ill virus and TBEV cocirculate. I. ricinus occurs in large parts of Europe. It extends as far as Turkey, northern Iran, and the Caucasus in the southeast. I. persul- catus occurs in eastern Europe, Siberia and as far east as Japan and China. There is an overlapping zone of I. ricinus with I. persulcatus from the northern Baltics to the Urals. The western border of the I. persulcatus distribution runs through Latvia. Only I. ricinus occurs west of this border, while both tick species occur east of it. Other transition zones can be found in eastern Estonia, Karelia (Russia), and the St. Petersburg area. Sequences of the TBEV-Eu subtype have been found in Latvian I. ricinus and those of TBEV-Sib in Latvian I. persulcatus (Süss et al., 2002). Such a boundary also exists at the border between Finland and Russia with I. persulcatus occurring on the Russian side. With the exception of one tick engorged on a migratory bird in Sweden (Jaenson et al., 1994), I. persulcatus has never been detected in west- ern or northern Europe until Jääskeläinen et al. (2006) detected I. persulcatus and the Siberian virus subtype in the Kokkola region in western Finland, 300 km south of the Arctic Circle, which was the first finding of the TBEV-Sib in northern Europe. Recently, Jääskeläinen et al. (2010b, 2011) identified a new TBE endemic focus in Simo, Finnish Lapland, and an unusual combi- nation of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus ticks in an area without any evidence of the occurrence of both Ixodes tick species or any cocir- culation of different TBEV subtypes. In the TBEV-endemic areas in Russia, the 3 subtypes persist at varying prevalences in ticks in individual geographic areas. Based on the E-glycoprotein sequences, the Far Eastern subtype predom- inates in the Far East (approximately 70%) along with the Siberian subtype. In Central Russia, 90% of the isolates can be classified as TBEV-Sib, the other isolates belonging to the TBEV-Fe group. In addition, a small number of isolates of the TBEV-Eu could be detected in I. persulcatus (Karan et al., 2010). In western Russia, TBEV-Sib is predominant, followed in decreasing order by TBEV- Fe and TBEV-Eu (Karan et al., 2010). For several regions in Russia (e.g. Yekaterinburg and Kemerovo) it is suspected that within the period from 1939 to 2009, TBEV-Fe has been replaced gradually by TBEV-Sib. In 1999, a large number of fatal cases of TBE characterized by an unusual haemorrhagic syndrome were identified in the Novosibirsk region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TBEV variants clustered with TBEV-Fe, but not with TBEV-Sib, and that they also differed from the already known Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus (Ternovoi et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the number of characterized TBEV strains and isolates is very low. As an example, only a few isolates have been obtained and fully identified in Germany so far, but all these sub- strains of TBEV-Eu (Salem, Amberg) showed the highest homology with the prototype strain Neudoerfl. The other 2 TBEV subtypes have not been detected at all (Süss et al., 2008a; Kupča et al., 2010). For Asia, with the exception of Japan, only a few strain char- acterizations are available. Thus, TBEV-Fe is predominant in China where it was isolated from the cerebral tissue of patients as well 4 orne D a c b e b f e e s n t e m u t r B b i w i b ( s c t t T I f T v r ( t s w p a l S r s m c t V c T t i ( T t J. Süss / Ticks and Tick-b s from ticks (Lu et al., 2008). In Japan, the Hokkaido isolate was learly classified as TBEV-Fe (Takashima et al., 2001). Surprisingly, TBEV sequences clustering with TBEV-Eu have een found in wild rodents (Apodemus agrarius) in South Korea (Kim t al., 2008; Yun et al., 2009). In I. ricinus in Europe, TBEV prevalence in unfed ticks varies etween 0.1 and 5% and increases during the tick development rom stage to stage. Higher virus prevalences have been recorded in ngorged ticks removed from humans (Bormane et al., 2004; Süss t al., 2004) and also in unfed ticks in certain regions of the Baltic tates (Latvia, Bormane et al., 2004). One hypothesis for this phe- omenon could be the virus replication in cells of host blood in the ick during and after the blood meal, but there is no experimental vidence of this yet. Bormane et al. (2004) reported that the annual ean infection rate with TBEV from 1993 to 2002 in field-collected nfed I. ricinus adults varied between 1.7 and 26.6%. In general, TBEV prevalences in I. persulcatus seem to be higher han in I. ricinus. Bormane et al. (2004) detected TBEV prevalence ates between 0 and 37.3% in adult I. persulcatus. iology of TBE virus transmission TBEV circulates within a ‘parasitic triangle’ of interactions etween virus, vector ticks, and tick hosts and is able to persist n a given habitat over long periods of time (Nuttall, 1999). The occurrence of vector ticks and suitable vertebrates on hich ticks can become infected are crucial for virus existence n a given area. The following mechanisms of virus transmission etween ticks occur: (i) feeding/cofeeding (Labuda et al., 1993a,b), ii) transovarial transmission, and perhaps (iii) sexual transmis- ion. Cofeeding transmission is especially effective, and the virus an be transmitted through this mechanism from a feeding vector ick to cofeeding ticks even on immune hosts, while transovarial ransmission is considerably less efficient. ransmission hosts I. ricinus feeds on many species of mammals, birds, and reptiles. n contrast, the number of transmission hosts for TBEV classified so ar is low. The host species that sustain the transmission cycle of BEV are partly determined by the host preference of the involved ector tick(s). A given reservoir host for TBEV must fulfil numerous equirements when infected. The outcome of human infection depends on the virus tropism e.g. the neurotropism), the virus subtype and its pathogenic poten- ial, on the immune status of the host, its age, and its genetic usceptibility to infection. During the infection process, virus fusion ith the host cell membrane is an essential and highly complex rocess. Membrane fusion by the TBEV is triggered by the mildly cidic pH of the endosome and is mediated through the enve- ope glycoprotein E, a class II viral fusion protein (Rey et al., 1995; tiasny et al., 2002). During the viraemic phase, many extraneu- al tissues are infected (Monath and Heinz, 1996). Haematogenic pread allows different organs to be infected (spleen, liver, bone arrow) (Haglund and Günther, 2003). During this phase of the linical course in patients, the virus crosses the blood–brain barrier o invade the central nervous system (CNS) (Dumpis et al., 1999). iral replication in the CNS causes lysis of cells, inflammation, and ellular dysfunction (Dumpis et al., 1999; Maximova et al., 2009). he neuropathogenesis of TBE is a complex of interactions between he TBEV and a number of host factors that trigger the susceptibil- ty to infection and the capacity for an effective antiviral response Ružek et al., 2009; Maximova et al., 2009). Encephalitis during a BEV infection has an immunopathological basis. There is a tendency for the 3 developmental stages of I. ricinus o feed on different kinds of host. Larvae feed on animals of all iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 sizes, nymphs mainly on medium-sized to large hosts, and adults are limited to medium-sized and large hosts. There is much over- lap between the hosts of larvae and nymphs. Certain small mammal species act as the main transmission hosts, in that they are able to transmit the virus via viraemia to feeding ticks and also by cofeed- ing. The rodents Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, and Myodes spp. are important as reservoir hosts for TBEV-Eu in Europe, A. agrar- ius and A. peninsula for TBEV-Sib in Siberia, and Myodes rufocanus and Microtus arvalis for TBEV-Fe in the Far East. Waldenström et al. (2007) found that some ticks attached to birds in Sweden carried TBEV. However, the TBEV prevalence in such ticks was over than the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, detected with com- parable methodologies, and little is known about the capability of birds of functioning as reservoirs of TBEV (Waldenström et al., 2007). TBEV infections may be amplified to significant levels as a result of the aggregated questing and feeding behaviour of the vector tick larvae (Labuda et al., 1993a). At the end of the blood meal, the larva detaches from the host, moults, and develops into a virus-infected nymph that can in turn transmit the virus to its host. Since most transmission hosts are not suitable for the adult stage to feed on, larvae and nymphs are of special importance for TBEV transmission. The development of I. ricinus from one generation to the next (egg to egg) can take as long as 2–6 years, but averages 3 years (Gray, 1991) and within this long time period, the virus can persist in the various tick stages and can also be transmitted. Even if the virus can infect a particular animal and replicate and disseminate in this host, this does not mean that the host is effective in transmitting the virus to feeding ticks. The viraemia of TBEV-infected goats, for example, is generally very short and of low intensity but this differs from animal to animal. Also, the time course of the shedding of the virus in goat milk is very short, between 2 and 8 days (Balogh et al., 2011). Cofeeding transmission Transmission between cofeeding ticks can occur in the absence of systemic viraemia in the host. If different developmental stages of I. ricinus feed in close proximity to each other, for example, on the ear of a mouse, the virus is, as a rule, transmitted directly from infected ticks to other (co-)feeding ticks. As the virus is transmit- ted directly, this mechanism is also very effective if the host has already developed neutralizing antibodies (Labuda et al., 1993a,b, 1997). According to the present state of knowledge and based on very sophisticated data, ecoepidemiologically cofeeding transmis- sion seems to be more common than viraemic transmission of TBEV. Labuda et al. (1996) revealed viral antigen in both migratory Langerhans cells and neutrophils. Also, migratory macrophages were shown to produce infectious virus. According to these results, the skin site of tick feeding is an important focus of viral replication early after TBEV transmission. Alimentary transmission The main route of TBEV infection of humans is a tick bite; much more rarely, the infection was transmitted by the alimentary route involving dairy products from livestock. Large domestic animals such as goats, sheep, and cattle are potential hosts for I. ricinus and may become infected by TBEV in endemic areas. These animals are viraemic over a very short period only and, as a rule, do not any show clinical symptoms. However, goats and sheep, more rarely cattle, are of special importance for the so-called alimentary acquired TBE. During the viraemic stage, the virus is excreted in milk and can be ingested orally by con- sumption of non-pasteurized milk or cheese produced from raw milk.

J. Süss / Ticks and Tick- n humans (e.g. in connection with holidays on a farm) may be he consequence. The clinical course of alimentary TBE is usually ore often biphasic than that of TBE induced by tick bite, in which nly 20–30% of the patients show a 2nd phase in the course of dis- ase. TBE in humans caused by virus-infected milk has increased ver the past decades in Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rus- ia, Albania, Austria, Czech Republic, and Hungary (Blaškovič, 1954; an Tongeren, 1955; Gresíková, 1958a,b; Levkovich and Pogodina, 958; Gresíková and Řeháček, 1959; Nosek et al., 1967; Gresíková t al., 1975; Kohl et al., 1996; Matuszczyk et al., 1997; Labuda et al., 002; Kerbo et al., 2005; Leutloff et al., 2006; Balogh et al., 2009; olzmann et al., 2009; Kříž et al., 2009). Clinical cases of alimentary BE have not been reported from Germany and Switzerland during he last few decades. In addition to transmission by tick bites and alimentary trans- ission, other routes of transmission have been described, e.g. aboratory infections (Avšič-Županc et al., 1995), blood transfusions Wahlberg et al., 1989), slaughtering of a viraemic goat (Kräusler, 981), and transmission from a viraemic mother to her baby by reast milk (Vaisviliene, 1997). oinfections It has been known for a long time that Ixodes species can arry several different pathogens at the same time, which they an also transmit to the host, e.g. TBEV, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu ato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia spp. It has also been hown that not only can simultaneous pathogen transmission dur- ng the blood meal occur, but that the host can also develop imultaneous clinical infections caused by different pathogens. Dif- erent pathogens in the same tick do not usually interfere with each ther, because they usually occupy certain different organs, tis- ues, or even cell structures that serve as specific ecological niches pathogens may be (i) mainly extracellular, (ii) mainly intracellular, nd (iii) both extra- and intracellular]. An overview of some of the ssues arising from mixed infections transmitted by ixodid ticks has een provided by Korenberg (2004). hanges in TBE epidemiology since 1990 Over the past decades, TBE has become a growing public health oncern in Europe and other parts of the world (Süss, 2003, 2008; unze and ISW-TBE, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010). TBEV is endemic in areas extending from central and Eastern urope to Siberia and parts of Asia. More and more TBEV endemic reas are being detected, especially in Asia, and therefore a large umber of new data must be expected. TBEV occurs in central Europe, the Baltic and Scandinavian ountries, and the Russian Federation. There are low-risk areas, or example, in Finland and Norway, with a trend towards both n expansion of risk areas and an increase in incidence. New oci have emerged in Denmark (Fomsgaard et al., 2009), Finland Jääskeläinen et al., 2010b, 2011), Sweden (Burenhult et al., 2002), orway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Austria (Walder et al., 2008), ermany (Süss et al., 2008b), and Switzerland (Krech, 2002). Table 1 summarizes the number of human TBE cases from 990 to 2009 in European countries with reliable epidemiologi- al information. TBE is notifiable in 15 of these countries. Over the ast 20 years, a total of 169,937 clinical cases of TBE have been egistered in Europe and Russia, with morbidity being subject to ather extreme fluctuations between countries and over time. In the eriod of observation, morbidity was highest in 1996 with 12,733 eported cases and lowest in 2008 with 5352 cases. There have een no known autochthonous cases in Belgium, Portugal, Spain, K, Ireland, or the Netherlands.

Fig. 1a shows the number of human TBE cases in Europe from 990 to 2009, Fig. 1b without the Russian cases, and Fig. 1c the umber of TBE cases in Russia alone. Surprisingly, the overall incidence of TBE in 7 countries in urope increased to a very high level in 2006 (Daniel et al., 008b). The exact reasons for these fluctuations are not fully under- tood. In view of their short-term nature, a direct influence of limate change and vaccination coverage appears unlikely. The xplanation of Randolph et al. (2008), who analyzed data from 8 ountries (Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Poland, ithuania, Estonia, Latvia), involves human behavioural responses o weather favourable for outdoor recreational activities, includ- ng mushroom and berry harvesting, differentially influenced by ational cultural practices and economic constraints. Daniel et al. iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 (2008a) comes to the conclusion that the epidemiological situa- tion of TBE in the Czech Republic in 2006 was obviously affected by 2 main factors – persisting host-seeking activity of I. ricinus in the autumn and increased tick-bite risk in the mushroom picking season. In 2009, increases in TBE incidence outside the range (±1 standard deviation) over recent 5 years were seen in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland; higher numbers, but not statistically sig- nificant occurred in the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Slovenia; slightly higher numbers than usual (apart from 2005 to 2006) were reported from Germany. Based on preliminary data, in Europe registered 7226 human cases of TBE in 2009 – 3721 (51.5%) of these in Russia alone. In 2008, 5352 cases had been registered in Europe – 2817 (52.6%) of them in Russia. In some central European countries (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Switzerland), the number of human TBE cases increased during the last 2 decades. The increase in TBE inci- dence shows a mean of 892 annual cases from 1990 to 1999 and a mean of 1382 annual cases from 2000 to 2009. Key epidemiological concepts Unfortunately, country data are not fully comparable because, even though many countries with mandatory notification use a case definition based on clinical and laboratory data, these defi- nitions vary between countries. Other endemic countries such as Switzerland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Norway do not have a formal case definition at all. Epidemiological data would be comparable more directly if, at least at the European level, endemic countries were to use a common TBE case definition and a com- mon definition of what should be considered an endemic area. To get developments in this direction underway, a European working group has developed a definition for both of these concepts (Süss et al., 2010). Endemic area definition An area endemic for TBEV is defined as an area with proven TBEV circulation between ticks and vertebrate hosts as determined by the detection of TBEV or the confirmation of autochthonous infections in animals or humans in the past 20 years. The development of a natural TBE focus depends on a variety of factors, including the pop- ulation dynamics of vector ticks and there hosts and the presence of susceptible host species. However, the reason for the patchy distribution of TBE is not quite clear. Korenberg (2009) summarizes a large number of pos- sible factors influencing the manifestation of a natural TBE focus, including virus prevalence in ticks, vector occurrence, and host activity as well as socio-economic and climate changes. Endemic areas of TBEV can only be characterized exactly, if all direct (virus isolation from ticks and small rodents) and indirect (serological detection of TBEV in animals, autochthonous human cases) specific virus detections within a complex natural focus were analyzed (Leutloff et al., 2006; Klaus et al., 2009; Holzmann et al., 2009). Klaus et al. (2010a) demonstrated this using as an example the natural focus of Salem, district Bodenseekreis, Germany. In this area, TBEV was detected due to the occurrence of autochthonous clinical TBE cases in humans. In 2006, a clinical TBE case in a monkey (Macaca sylvanus) of the Salem monkey park was confirmed, the TBEV strain Salem (substrain of Neudoerfl prototype virus) was isolated from the brain of this animal and retrospective analysis of anamnestic data from monkeys showed that TBE may already have appeared sporadically in macaques in the past (Süss et al., 2007). To characterize this endemic area further, the sero- borne p a s l f t a e a 2 i 1 R t t v i ( a d c d a h e 2 d a i t e 2 T c ( ( b r b a b e s p t ( i J.

Sheep of a migratory flock in the direct urroundings of the monkey enclosure showed a TBEV seropreva- ence of 9.0% (neutralization assay). However, no TBEV-RNA was ound in (a small number of) ticks collected in this area. In conclusion, the seroprevalence in free-ranging animals and he prevalence of TBEV in hosts can, together with human and nimal clinical TBE cases, provide further information on the eco- pidemiological situation and help describe the TBE risk in a defined rea, especially if the TBEV prevalence in ticks is low (Klaus et al., 010a,b). Within its geographic range, the virus is not equally distributed; nstead, it tends to occur "

To determine the vertebrate host of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, virus isolation was performed using spleens from small mammals captured in the area. Two virus strains were isolated, one strain from Apodemus speciosus and another from Clethrionomys rufocanus. Virus isolates were inoc- ulated onto baby hamster kidney cell monolayers and antigen slides were prepared for an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay. Two isolates were identified as TBE viruses by monoclonal antibody reactions. To specify the TBE- endemic area in Hokkaido, rodent, horse, and dog sera collected from 1992 to 1997 were tested for neutralization antibody against TBE virus previously isolated from a dog. The positive cases were distributed in four districts in the southern part of Hokkaido. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is one of the most important flaviviruses causing severe illness in humans. Two subtypes of TBE virus, the European subtype and the Far Eastern subtype have been distinguished based upon clinical features and antigenic and genetic characteristics.1–6 Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus of the Far Eastern subtype causes severe disease in humans with a mortality that can reach 50% in some outbreaks.7 Disease associated with the European subtype is less severe and mortality is usually less than 5%.7 Tick-borne encephalitis is currently endemic over a wide area that covers Europe and northern Asia. Several thousand human cases are recorded annually.8 Persistence of TBE virus in nature relies on transmission cycles determined by interactions among the viruses, their vector ticks, and their vertebrate hosts. Primary tick vectors that play a crucial role in maintaining the transmission cycle of TBE virus have been identified: Ixodes persuleatus for Far Eastern TBE virus9 and I. ricinus for European TBE virus.9 The most important vertebrate hosts for TBE virus are rodents having the highest population densities within an endemic focus (generally Apodemus, Clethrionomys, or Mi- crotus species).9 In Japan, a TBE case had not been reported until a severe encephalitis case in 1993 was diagnosed as TBE in Hokkai- do.10 Serologic examination of paired serum specimens of the patient showed an increase in the neutralizing antibody titer to RSSE virus.10 Three virus isolates were obtained in 1995 from the blood of sentinel dogs kept in the study area where the case occurred.10 Sequence analysis of the envelope protein gene identified the isolate as being of the same sub- type as the RSSE virus.10 In another study in 1996 in the same area, two virus isolates were obtained from 600 I. ova- tus ticks collected from vegetation by flagging.11 These re- sults provide evidence that TBE is endemic in some areas of Japan. This report describes the results of further epizo- otiologic study of TBE in Hokkaido, Japan. Serologic sur- veys of small mammals and isolation of viruses were con- ducted to speculate on the possible vertebrate hosts of TBE virus in the study area where the human case occurred. The serologic surveys were expanded using dog and horse sera collected from other districts of Hokkaido to determine the prevalence of TBE virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study site. Hokkaido is divided into 14 administrative districts in which surveys were performed (Figure1). At the town of Kamiiso in the Oshima district, a woman living in the countryside contracted severe viral encephalitis in 1993 and was later serologically diagnosed as having TBE.10 In the following studies in 1995 and 1996, several strains of TBE virus were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs10 and I. ovatus ticks.11 Animal and sample collection. Small mammals, mainly wild rodents, were captured in Sherman (H. B. Sherman, Deland, FL) box traps with oatmeal as bait in the case study area at Kamiiso in grass and shrub areas within forests bor- dering on pastures. In October 1995 and 1996, 169 small mammals were captured in two nights of trapping. The small mammal trapped were Clethrionomys rufocanus, Apodemus aregenteus, A. speciosus, Rattus norvegicus, Sorex ungui- culatus, and Sorex sp. Animals were bled after being killed with an overdose of ether and their spleens were removed. Sera from the blood was frozen at 2408C until the neutral- ization assay. Spleens were frozen immediately by placing them in a cooling box with dry ice and were later kept at 2808C until virus isolation trials. In 1992, horse sera were collected from 700 animals: 50 samples from at least five farms in each district. The horses were apparently healthy and consisted mostly of draught breeds. Sera were kept at 2408C until assayed. From 1994 to 1997, sera was obtained from 193 dogs in eight districts (at least five different locales in one district). Serum was collected from dogs that roamed freely in farming areas. Ticks were collected from rodents and dogs, but not from horses. Virus isolation was attempted from adult ticks (mostly I. ovatus) obtained from dogs with negative results.11 Ticks (larvae and nymphs) from rodents were not subjected to virus isolation because they were pro- cessed for species identification. Cells and viruses. The baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cell line was grown at 378C in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM; Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Ja- pan) containing 4% fetal calf serum (FCS). The viruses used were TBE virus Oshima strain (Oshima-U5-10 isolated from a dog),10 Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (strain JaGAr-01),12 RSSE (strain Sofjin), and Langat virus (strain TP-21).

Oshima, JaGAr-01, Sofjin and TP-21 viruses underwent three, . 20, five, and 10 intracerebral passages in suckling mice, respectively. The viruses were propagated in one-day- old suckling mice by intracerebral inoculation. Moribund mice were killed and their brains were homogenized into a 10% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.7, containing 10% FCS (10% FCS-PBS) and frozen until used. The BHK cell monolayers were infected with the 10% virus suspensions and culture fluids were collected on days 3–5 and frozen as working virus stocks. Virus isolation and identification. Rodent spleen was triturated in 2 ml of 10% FCS-PBS with a mortar and pestle. The suspensions were centrifuged at 2,500 3 g for 5 min and the supernatants were removed for inoculation into mice. One-day-old suckling mice (ICR) were inoculated intracra- nially with the supernatant. Ten baby mice from one litter were used for one sample and each received 20 ml of su- pernatant. The mice were observed for 14 days, and mori- bund or dead mice were removed, killed (the moribund ones), and kept frozen at 2808C. The brains were removed from the mice and made into 10% suspensions in 10% FCS- PBS. The BHK-21 cell monolayers formed in 50-ml plastic culture bottles were inoculated with the brain suspensions and incubated at 378C until cytopathic effects appeared, usu- ally on days 4–5. The inoculated monolayers were trypsin- ized, dispersed into MEM with 4% FCS, and seeded onto 24-well glass slides. After a 4-hr incubation in a CO2 incu- bator, the cells were fixed with cold acetone for 20 min and stored at 2808C as antigen slides. For the serologic identification of the virus isolates, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay was per- formed using the antigen slides prepared and monoclonal antibodies provided by Dr. Franz X. Heinz (Institute of Vi- rology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). These mono- clonal antibodies were prepared against the European sub- type TBE virus and their reaction patterns to various flavi- viruses have been reported.13–16 Briefly, genus-specific mono- clonal antibody 6E2 reacts with most flaviviruses, group-specific monoclonal antibody 2E7 reacts with the vi- ruses of the TBE group, and subtype-specific monoclonal antibody 7G7 reacts with viruses of the European and Far Eastern subtypes, but not with Langat virus and louping ill virus. The antigen slides were incubated with monoclonal antibodies for 1 hr at 378C and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) three times. The slides were then overlaid with fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated antibody to mouse IgG (1:800; Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). After incubation for 1 hr at 378C and washing with PBS, the plates were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The IFA titer was deter- mined as the highest dilution of the antibody showing a pos- itive fluorescent reaction. Neutralization test. Neutralization testing of animal sera followed the method described previously.17 Briefly, BHK cell monolayers were formed in 96-well, flat-bottom plates (Falcon 3072; Becton Dickinson Laboratories, Oxnard, CA). The test sera were diluted serially in two-fold steps from 1: 20 to 1:640 in a 96-well plate. Each serum dilution was then combined with an equal volume (80 ml) of the virus, adjusted to give a final count of approximately 50 focus-forming units per well. The virus strains used were Oshima-U5-10 and JE JaGAr-01. The serum-virus mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 378C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, 50 ml of each mixture was transferred to the wells of 96-well plates containing a monolayer of BHK-21 cells. The plates were incubated for 90 min at 378C to allow virus adsorption. After removing the mixture, the cells were covered with MEM containing 4% FCS and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose so- dium. After incubation for 38 hr at 378C, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and fixed with absolute methanol at room temperature for 20 min. Focus staining was done by the peroxidase-anti-per- oxidase (PAP) procedure as described previously.17 Fixed BHK cells were treated consecutively with mouse anti-Lan- gat immune ascites (1:500), goat anti-mouse IgG serum (1: 200), and mouse PAP complex (1:4000; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Each incubation lasted 60 min and was 289ISOLATION OF TBE VIRUS FROM RODENTS IN JAPAN TABLE 2 Identification of virus isolates by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)* MAb specificities IFA antibody titer to JEV Langat RSSEV Oshima A-1 Oshima C-1 Genus-reactive 6E2 .6,400 6,400 6,400 6,400 6,400 Group-specific 2E7 ,100 .6,400 6,400 .6,400 .6,400 Subtype-specific 7G7 ,100 ,100 6,400 1,600 1,600 * JEV 5 Japanese encephalitis virus; RSSEV 5 Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. followed by three washings with PBS. In the final step of the PAP procedure, the color reaction was developed with a substrate solution consisting of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 0.3 mg/ml of 3-39-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in PBS. The neutralizing antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that reduced the number of foci to 50% or less of the control value. A titer . 1:20 was considered positive. The TBE-specific antibody was defined as the titer to Langat or Oshima-U5-10 viruses . four-fold the titer of JE virus. RESULTS Epidemiologic survey of small mammals. Small mam- mals were captured in the study area (Figure 1) in 1995 and 1996. Antibody surveys and virus isolation were conducted to determine possible vertebrate hosts. In 1995, 44 small mammals were captured. Tick-borne encephalitis–specific antibody was detected in two of 11 A. speciosus, three of 16 C. rufocanus, one of 11 A. aregenteus, and one of four R. norvegicus (Table 1). In 1996, 125 small mammals were examined. Among them, two of 13 A. speciosus, 11 of 79 C. rufocanus, and one R. norvegicus had TBE-specific an- tibody. All sera with TBE-specific antibody had neutralizing antibody titers . 1:40 to Oshima-U5-10 virus and , 1:20 to JE virus. Virus isolation was performed using spleens from all an- imals and two virus strains were isolated (Table 1). One strain was from an A. speciosus captured in 1995. This an- imal had a positive neutralization antibody titer of 1:40. An- other strain was isolated from a C. rufocanus rodent captured in 1996 that had a positive neutralization antibody titer of 1: 80. Identification of the virus isolates. Virus isolates desig- nated as Oshima-A-1 and Oshima-C-1 from A. speciosus and C. rufocanus, respectively, were inoculated onto BHK cell monolayers. The IFA slides were prepared and titers of the monoclonal antibodies were determined (Table 2). Genus- specific 6E2, group-specific 2E7, and subtype-specific 7G7 monoclonal antibodies showed high titers to Oshima-A-1, Oshima-C-1, and RSSE viruses. Two isolates were identified as TBE virus. Seroepizootiologic surveillance using horse and dog sera in Hokkaido. To specify the extent of the TBE endemic area in Hokkaido, horse and dog sera collected from 1992 to 1997 were examined for neutralizing antibody to TBE virus strain Oshima-U5-10 previously isolated from a dog in 1995 and th JE virus (strain JaGAr-01). Tick-borne enceph- alitis–specific antibody was detected in three of 700 horse sera (Table 3). Of 193 dog sera, 18 sera had TBE specific antibody (Table 3). All sera with TBE-specific antibody had neutralizing antibody titers . 1:40 to Oshima-U5-10 virus and , 1:20 to JE virus. The TBE antibody-positive areas found from horse and dog serology are indicated in Figure 1. The antibody-positive areas were distributed in four dis- tricts, including that of the human case in the southern part of Hokkaido. DISCUSSION This study was undertaken to obtain information about possible vertebrate hosts of TBE virus in the area where a TBE patient resided and the extent of TBE virus distribution in Hokkaido. The reason for targeting the rodent, dog, and horse was that the suspected vector tick,11 I. ovatus, is a three host tick that feeds sequentially on small mammals such as rodents at the larval and nymphal stages, and on large ani- mals such as dogs and horses at the adult stage.18 Survey results suggest that rodents such as C. rufocanus and A. speciosus act as the vetebrate hosts of TBE virus in the endemic area. Antibody-positive A. speciosus were de- tected in 1995 (2 of 11) and in 1996 (2 of 13), and antibody- positive C. rufocanus were detected in 1995 (3 of 16) and 1996 (11 of 79). The TBE virus strains were isolated from 290 TAKEDA AND OTHERS A. speciosus and C. rufocanus. It has been shown that var- ious Apodemus, Clethrionomys, or Microtus species are im- portant as maintenance hosts for TBE virus of European and Far-Eastern subtypes.9,19 In our previous report, two TBE viruses were isolated from 600 I. ovatus (minimum infection rate 5 0.33%) col- lected in the study area11 where the TBE human case oc- curred.10 This indicates that I. ovatus was the vector tick of TBE virus in the area. Thus, I. ovatus ticks and rodents (C. rufocanus and A. speciosus) may be important elements in the transmission cycle of TBE virus in the area. The viruses isolated from rodents were identified as TBE virus from the IFA antigenic analysis with monoclonal an- tibodies. Our previous study identified the virus isolated from the dogs in 1995 as TBE virus Far Eastern (RSSE) subtype by nucleotide sequencing data of the envelope pro- tein gene, which showed 95.7% identity.10 Our preliminary study shows that the isolates from rodents showed a high degree of similarity in nucleotide sequences of the envelope protein gene with those of the dog isolate (99.5% identity) and RSSE subtype Sofijin strain (95.3% identity). Therefore, the isolates from the rodents in the present study may also belong to the TBE virus Far Eastern subtype. In the serologic survey, neutralization tests were per- formed using the TBE virus Oshima-U5-10 strain isolated from a dog in 1995. In Hokkaido, JE virus has been known to be endemic for three years as indicated by serologic sur- vey of domestic animals.20 Therefore, neutralization titers of the sera were also measured for JE virus. The positive sera for TBE neutralizing antibody had negative antibody titers (, 1:20) for JE virus, which showed that the neutralization assay system was reliable for detecting TBE virus–infected individuals. When this assay system was used to test horse and dog sera, endemic foci were found in four districts. These results provide evidence that TBE foci are distributed not only in the area where a human TBE case occurred, but also in other areas in southern Hokkaido. These findings may be of great importance because the range of I. ovatus extends into the densely populated main island of Honshu.18,21 Discrepancies in the serologic survey results in the Osh- ima district were evident between horses (0 of 50) and dogs (16 of 21). This may be due to the intensive collection of dog sera in the area where the TBE patient was found, whereas horse sera were collected from other areas because no farms with horses were present in the area in which the patient with TBE was found. The positive horse sera were detected in samples collected in 1992. The TBE patient was observed in 1993.10 Subse- quently, evidence of virus was detected by virus isolations (from ticks11 and rodents) and a seroepizootiologic survey (in rodents and dogs) in this study. It is apparent that TBE virus has been endemic in some areas of Hokkaido for at least five years (from 1992 to 1997). The information em- phasizes the need for preventive measures for emerging TBE in Hokkaido. Acknowledgment: We thank Dr. Franz X.

Tavares-Neto-2004-Serologic survey for yellow.pdf	"Sem título-4 1 ARTIGO/ARTICLERevista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 Pesquisa de anticorpos contra arbovírus e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela em uma amostra da população de Rio Branco, antes e três meses após a vacina 17D Serologic survey for yellow fever and other arboviruses among inhabitants of Rio Branco, Brazil, before and three months after receiving the yellow fever 17D vaccine José Tavares-Neto 1, Juliano Freitas-Carvalho 1, Márcio Roberto Teixeira Nunes 2, Grace Rocha 3, Sueli Guerreiro Rodrigues 2, Edilândio Damasceno 2, Recleides Darub 3, Sebastião Viana 3 e Pedro Fernando da Costa Vasconcelos 2 RESUMO Em amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), foi pesquisada a freqüência de portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus, mais prevalentes na região amazônica, e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela, antes e após a imunização com a vacina 17D. Das 390 pessoas incluídas na primeira fase do estudo (agosto de 1999), somente 190 compareceram em janeiro de 2000, três meses após a aplicação da vacina 17D (outubro de 1999). Nas amostras da primeira fase, as freqüências de soropositivos (IH) para os vírus estudados foram: 17D (27,2%); Dengue-1 (0,3%); Dengue-2 (4,1%); Dengue-3 (0%); Dengue-4 (0%), entre outros 8 vírus. Nas amostras séricas de janeiro (2000), a soroconversão para o 17D foi de 89,7% (130/145) e 3,2% (6/ 190) passaram a ter anticorpos contra o sorotipo 3 (DEN-3). Em conclusão, por conta da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal e de soroconversão há redução significativa do risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela na cidade de Rio Branco, apesar de não ser desprezível a possibilidade de uma nova epidemia de dengue, pelo DEN-3, a semelhança da registrada em 2000 e 2001 pelos sorotipos 1 e 2.

ABSTRACT During a yellow fever vaccination campaign among residents of Rio Branco (Acre State), the frequency of HI antibodies to the most prevalent arboviruses in the Amazon region and to yellow fever virus was determined before and three months after immunization with YF 17D vaccine. From 390 inhabitants included in the first phase of serologic survey (August 1999), only 190 provided a second serum sample, after the use of 17D vaccine (January 2000). Among first phase samples, the frequency of HI antibodies was: 17D (27.2%); Ilheus (5.9%); Mayaro (5.4%); Caraparu (4.9%); Dengue-2 (4.1%); Oropouche (2.3%); and Dengue-1 (0.3%). In the second study phase, the serologic conversion to YF reached 89.7% among previously negative persons. Serologic conversions were also observed to Ilheus (6.2%); Dengue-3 (3.2%); Mayaro (1.1%); and Oropouche (1.1%) viruses. In conclusion, considering the high YF antibody rate after vaccination, the risk of urban yellow fever seems insignificant, although the lower prevalence of HI antibodies to dengue viruses, is of concern and inhabitants are under high risk of dengue outbreaks, especially to DEN-3 recently introduced in Brazil, as was observed in 2000 and 2001 with DEN-1 and DEN-2.

Não obstante, na população do Estado do Acre há uma lacuna no conhecimento sobre a soroepidemiologia dos arbovírus e o impacto na Saúde Pública17, apesar das condições epidemiológicas favoráveis à circulação de arbovírus em decorrência das extensas áreas de florestas tropicais nativas e da grande biodiversidade. Nessa região do Brasil, os estudos arbovirológicos ficaram restritos às investigações iniciais sobre a Febre Negra de Lábrea6 e de tentativas de isolamento viral em animais (aves, répteis e mosquitos) coletados no município de Sena Madureira7 8. Mais recentemente, em janeiro de 2001, ocorreu a incidência máxima da epidemia de dengue pelos sorotipos 1 e 2 (DEN-1 e DEN-2) nas cidades do Vale do Rio Acre, especialmente na capital do Estado (Rio Branco). Isto, após o registro crescente de casos de dengue ao longo do segundo semestre de 20004. Anteriormente, em novembro de 1999, houve registro dos primeiros casos de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija, vizinha às cidades acreanas de Brasiléia e Epitaciolância4. Essa situação do Estado do Acre motivou o presente estudo soroepidemiológico sobre os principais arbovírus descritos na região amazônica, em uma amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco, antes (agosto de 1999) da vacinação em massa contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (17D) em 10 de outubro de 1999 e da ocorrência da epidemia de dengue em 2000/2001. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS No primeiro dia da Campanha Estadual de Vacinação contra o vírus da hepatite B (VHB), em 14 de agosto de 1999, foram selecionadas 394 pessoas residentes na área urbana da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), com 2 ou mais anos de idade, entre aquelas que compareceram a um dos 212 Postos de Vacinação (temporários) da cidade. Em cada Posto de Vacinação foi selecionada de uma a duas pessoas para coleta da amostra sangüínea e levantamento de informações demográficas e sobre a vacinação prévia contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela, após conhecer os objetivos da pesquisa e assinar o termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido. A primeira pessoa selecionada era aquela da fila para vacinação que estava sendo atendida (ainda na fase de preenchimento dos dados pessoais), quando da chegada da equipe da pesquisa ao Posto de Vacinação. Nos Postos de Vacinação com mais de 30 pessoas na fila, foi selecionada a outra pessoa subseqüente na fila, desde que não-membro da família da primeira. Quando houve recusa de alguma pessoa (no total de dois casos), foi incluída a pessoa seguinte na fila para vacinação2. Em seguida ao preenchimento do questionário, foram coletados de 8 a 10ml de sangue venoso sem anticoagulante. Em seguida, as amostras sangüíneas foram centrifugadas e estocadas (-20o C) no LACEN- AC, onde foram conservadas até o envio para o Laboratório de Arbovírus do Instituto Evandro Chagas (Belém, PA), para a pesquisa de anticorpos inibidores da hemaglutinação (IH), pela técnica de Clarke & Casals modificada por Shope21, dos seguintes arbovírus: Alphavirus da família Togaviridae (vírus Mayaro e Mucambo); Flavivirus da família Flaviviridae (vírus Ilhéus, Rocio, Dengue-1, Dengue-2, Dengue-3, Dengue-4, Saint Louis e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela, 17D); e Bunyavirus da família Bunyaviridae (vírus Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu). Esses 13 vírus, nem todos são estritamente arbovírus10, foram estudados usando soros-controles, positivos e negativos, padronizados pelo IEC (Belém, PA) e considerando soropositivo a amostra com título recíproco ≥20. Os soropositivos para os sorotipos do vírus da dengue foram considerados como resposta primária ou secundária, de acordo com os critérios da Organização Panamericana de Saúde14: ( i) primária, quando o t í tulo recíproco era <1.280 e, simultaneamente, havia ausência de resposta ou títulos 4 vezes menores para os demais sorotipos do dengue ou outros flavivírus; e (ii) secundária, títulos recíprocos iguais ou maiores a 1.280 para todos os sorotipos do dengue e/ou outros flavivírus. A segunda etapa do estudo foi realizada três (3) meses depois, entre os dias 19 a 21 de janeiro de 2000, após a aplicação da vacina contra o 17D (BIOMANGUINHOS®, Rio de Janeiro) no dia 10 de outubro de 2000 em toda a população do Estado do Acre. Oito dias antes do início da segunda etapa, todos os participantes do estudo (n=394) foram convidados, por carta, pela Secretaria de Estado de Sáude e Saneamento do Estado (SESSACRE) para nova coleta de sangue, sendo esclarecido qual o objetivo do estudo (pesquisa sorológica do marcador anti-HBs do VHB e anti-17D), e o motivo, ambos descritos em linguagem acessível ao grande público. Na mesma carta-convite, foi solicitado que a pessoa ou responsável legal levasse a caderneta de vacinação, entregue em agosto de 1999, ou atualizada em outubro e dezembro de 1999 por ocasião, respectivamente, da primeira, segunda (+ a vacina 17D) e terceira doses da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Nessa segunda etapa, após a coleta de nova amostra sangüínea, foram seguidos os mesmos procedimentos anteriores, e preenchido o segundo módulo do questionário (dados pessoais, história de vacinação nos meses anteriores e exame da caderneta de vacinação). Por ocasião da segunda etapa do estudo, ainda não eram conhecidos os resultados dos exames sorológicos da primeira amostra sérica. As análises estatísticas foram realizadas com auxílio do “software” Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Na análise dos resultados, as pessoas naturais do Estado do Acre e nascidas em municípios da região oriental foram incluídas como sendo da região do Vale do Rio Acre, enquanto que aquelas nascidas em municípios da região central e ocidental do Estado como do Vale do Rio Juruá. Para as variáveis contínuas foram determinadas a média, o desvio-padrão e a mediana, enquanto para as variáveis categóricas as medidas de freqüência. As associações foram consideradas estatisticamente significantes se a probabilidade do erro α foi ≤0,05 (p≤5%). RESULTADOS Das 394 pessoas incluídas no estudo, quatro foram excluídas porque a primeira amostra sérica foi perdida durante o processamento laboratorial ou por ocasião do transporte até Belém (PA). Na segunda etapa do estudo, somente atenderam ao convite 190 (48,7%) pessoas. Os resultados da pesquisa sorológica na 3 Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 primeira (de agosto de 1999) e na segunda (de janeiro de 2000) amostras séricas estão descritos na Tabela 1. Todas as respostas sorológicas foram do tipo primária, exceto em 21,7% (23/106) dos 17D-positivos (agosto de 1999) e que foi secundária para dois ou mais flavivírus. Na Tabela 2, foi comparado o resultado sorológico dentre as variáveis demográficas pesquisadas (sexo e idade), tanto nas pessoas com anticorpos contra o 17D (em agosto de 1999) como para o conjunto daqueles com anticorpos para os arbovírus pesquisados em agosto de 1999. Nesse último grupo, a pessoa amostrada somente foi considerada uma vez e excluindo aquelas com anticorpos para o vírus 17D. Por isto, dos 203 soropositivos (106 para o 17D e 97 para os outros arbovírus), somente foram incluídas 80 pessoas, ou seja, 17 (80 + 17=97) pessoas tinham anticorpos para 2 (n=13) ou 3 (n=4) dos arbovírus investigados. Desse modo, foi possível mostrar na Tabela 2 que antes da intervenção (vacina contra a febre amarela), havia a predominância significante (p<0,05) de pessoas soropositivas para o 17D do sexo masculino (31,9% vs 22,8%), mas que após a vacinação as freqüências (respectivamente, 93,1% vs 91,3%) de soroconvertidos foram semelhantes (p>0,62). Em relação ao estudo sorológico da amostra de agosto de 1999, as pessoas do sexo masculino foram também mais freqüentemente (p<0,005) soropositivas (26,6% vs 14,8%) para o conjunto de arbovírus. Quanto à idade, os soropositivos para o 17D em agosto de 1999 (p<0,001) e para o conjunto dos arbovírus (p<0,001) apresentaram médias de idade significativamente maiores (Tabela 2). No entanto, entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos (n=145), na amostra de agosto de 1999 e também avaliados em janeiro de 2000, foram semelhantes (p>0,46) as médias das idades dos soropositivos e negativos (Tabela 2).

Não foi estudado o tempo de residência no Estado do Acre, mas a distribuição do resultado sorológico para o conjunto dos arbovírus pesquisados teve freqüências de soropositivos semelhantes (p>0,18) quanto à naturalidade: Estado do Acre (19,6% ou 62/316); outros Estados amazônicos (16,7% ou 6/36) ou de outras unidades federadas (31,6% ou 12/38). Também, entre os naturais do Estado do Acre (n=316), não foram observadas diferenças significantes (p>0,20) nas freqüências de soropositivos (conjunto de arbovírus) entre aqueles naturais de municípios do Vale do Acre (18,3% ou 47/257) versus os do Vale do Juruá (25,4% ou 15/59). Entre os naturais do Vale do Acre (n=257), grande parte (80,9%; n=208) era da cidade de Rio Branco. O valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação prévia, em relação à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D nas amostras de agosto de 1999, foi baixo - de 30,6% (64/209) -, ao contrário do valor Tabela 1 - Freqüências de anticorpos contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (FA-17D) e arbovírus em moradores da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), antes (agosto de 1999) e depois da vacinação contra o 17D (outubro, 2000).

Entre os soronegativos (n=284) compareceram na segunda etapa 145 (51,1%) pessoas e do grupo de soropositivos (n=106) 45 (42,4%) atenderam o convite, sendo essas diferenças sem significado estatístico (χ²=2,78; p>0,09). Na segunda etapa, a soroconversão (três meses após a vacina 17D) foi de 89,7% (130/ 145) e os 45 soropositivos (da amostra de agosto de 1999), pesquisados em janeiro de 2000, tiveram o mesmo resultado sorológico anterior. A soroprevalência dos portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus pesquisados (Tabela 1), foi inferior a 6%, inclusive para o Oropouche (2,3%), Mayaro (5,4%) e Ilhéus (5,9%), entre outros. Chama a atenção, as freqüências de soropositivos, nas amostras de agosto de 1999, contra os sorotipos do vírus da dengue, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 e DEN-4, respectivamente: 0,3%; 4,1%; 0% e 0%. No entanto, cinco meses após (janeiro de 2000) da primeira amostra sangüínea (em agosto de 1999), todos os soronegativos (DEN-1, DEN-2 e DEN-3) pesquisados assim permaneceram, mas 3,2% (6/190) daqueles soronegativos para o DEN-3 ficaram soropositivos (Tabela 1). Em tempo semelhante, também foi observada soroconversão para os arbovírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%). 4 preditivo-negativo de 77,4% (89/115), mas as diferenças observadas (Tabela 3) não alcançaram significância estatística (p>0,24). Quando foi levantada a história de vacinação contra o vírus vacinal 17D, em outubro de 1999, e comparada à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000, o valor preditivo- positivo foi elevado de 92,1% (152/165), sendo baixo (8,3%) o valor preditivo-negativo (Tabela 3). A Tabela 3 também mostra que foi muito baixa (0,3%) a freqüência de pessoas que portavam a caderneta de vacinação, quando da primeira dose da Campanha Estadual (agosto de 1999) e que em janeiro de 2000, cinco meses após, somente 39,5% apresentaram a caderneta de vacinação, mas sendo semelhante (p>0,60) a proporção de soropositivos entre os portadores da caderneta (93,3%) e os não-portadores (91,3%). Nenhuma pessoa, com história de vacinação (17D) em outubro de 1999 e pesquisada em janeiro de 2000, referiu qualquer agravo à saúde nos três meses subseqüentes ou a algum evento adverso, relacionado à vacina, de intensidade moderada ou grave. DISCUSSÃO Esse é o primeiro estudo realizado no Estado do Acre, sobre a prevalência de portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus mais prevalentes na região Norte do Brasil17 18 19. Talvez, pela procedência e naturalidade predominantemente urbana da amostra populacional, a freqüência de soropositivos (<6%) para grande parte dos vírus estudados (Mayaro, Mucambo, Ilhéus, Rocio, Saint Louis, Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu) foi inferior à esperada, considerando os resultados de outros estudos sorológicos realizados na região amazônica17. É preciso considerar que não devem ser raros os prováveis contatos (e.g. lazer e ocupacionais) com áreas de florestas nativas, inclusive entre aqueles nascidos na cidade de Rio Branco, o que muito mais provavelmente ocorre entre os nascidos em cidades de menor porte do Estado do Acre. No entanto, o encontro de mais soropositivos (31,6% vs <20%) entre os não-naturais de Estados amazônicos, apesar da ausência de significado estatístico, pode evidenciar a maior exposição desses migrantes em atividades extrativistas ou vinculadas à agricultura ou à agroindústria. Na população estudada, a soroconversão observada para os vírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%), entre a primeira e a segunda amostra sérica, evidencia a provável circulação desses vírus ou outro(s) antigenicamente relacionado(s). Considerando as características da população avaliada, especialmente o efeito da amplitude da faixa etária e do maior contingente de naturais da cidade de Rio Branco, essas incidências, no período de 5 meses, podem ser classificadas como de valores entre médios a elevados. No entanto, na região Norte do Brasil, não há conhecimento sobre estudo avaliando a incidência de alguma infecção por arbovírus. Coerentemente, as pessoas com anticorpos para o conjunto dos arbovírus estudados foram mais freqüentemente do sexo masculino e de maior idade, evidenciando provavelmente a maior exposição dessas pessoas às áreas de maior circulação dos vírus estudados, onde são próprias para as atividades ocupacionais extrativistas, agrícolas ou de lazer (e. g. caça e pesca). Em publicações anteriores, a freqüência de soropositivos para anticorpos contra esses arbovírus aumentou, proporcionalmente, ao aumento da idade9 22 23, o que pode ter associação com o tempo de maior exposição nas atividades de maior risco para adquirir a infecção. No entanto, quanto ao sexo, as observações são variáveis conforme a população estudada22 e, talvez isto se explique, por questões de gênero ou, mais especificamente, porque as mulheres têm menos rotineiramente atividades vinculadas às áreas de floresta tropical. Como registrado, ao longo de 1999, pela Secretaria de Estado da Saúde e Saneamento do Estado do Acre (SESSACRE), os casos de Tavares-Neto J et al Tabela 3 - História de vacinação contra o 17D, prévia a agosto de 1999 e em outubro de 1999, e a comprovação da mesma (caderneta de vacinação), relacionadas a distribuição de anticorpos IH anti-17D.

No entanto, em novembro de 1999, houve os primeiros registros de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija4. Portanto, as soroprevalências dos DEN-1 (0,3%) e DEN-2 (4,1%) observadas nas amostras de agosto de 1999, provavelmente, espelham aquele momento epidemiológico. Já no ano 2000, na cidade de Rio Branco foram notificados 2.178 casos de dengue, especialmente nos meses de novembro (n=326) e dezembro (n=525), e com a confirmação de 1.283 casos (SESSACRE, dados não-publicados). Também no ano 2000, de janeiro a dezembro, os índices de infestação predial pelo Aedes aegypti na cidade de Rio Branco variaram de 0% a 16,47% (média de 3,5%), conforme o bairro pesquisado (SESSACRE-DABS, dados não-publicados). Quando do segundo levantamento soroepidemiológico (janeiro de 2000), a curva epidêmica da dengue poderia estar com a incidência de nível endêmico, mas não ainda em fase de progressão ou que pode ter começado a ocorrer no segundo semestre de 2000. Porque, não só considerando o conhecimento sobre as curvas epidêmicas da dengue23, os casos notificados foram mais freqüentes a partir de novembro e dezembro de 2000 e a incidência máxima da epidemia na terceira semana epidemiológica (janeiro) de 2001, simultaneamente pelos sorotipos DEN-1 e DEN-2, quando foram confirmados 410 dos 445 casos notificados na cidade de Rio Branco4. Mais recentemente, nas cidades de Brasiléia e Epitaciolândia, na divisa com a cidade de Cobija (Bolívia), também foram confirmados casos autóctones de DEN-1 e DEN-24. Por isto, vale ressaltar a observação dos 6 (3,2%) casos com anticorpos contra o sorotipo DEN-3 em janeiro de 2000, sendo anteriormente (agosto de 1999) soronegativos para esse mesmo sorotipo. Oficialmente, o DEN-3 foi isolado no Brasil em dezembro de 2000 na cidade do Rio de Janeiro12, seguido por isolamentos subseqüentes ou de epidemias em populações de cidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil3. Portanto, o registro de soropositivos (IH) para o DEN-3 em amostras séricas extraídas em janeiro de 2000 é digno de nota, especialmente porque foram em pessoas residentes em região distante daquelas localidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil. Contudo, vale também ressaltar, apesar do isolamento geográfico do Estado do Acre, muitas das cidades do Vale do Acre, inclusive Rio Branco, têm grande intercâmbio de pessoas e mercadorias com a cidade de Cobija (Estado de Pando, Bolívia), onde há aeroporto internacional e com possibilidade de comunicação aérea com outros centros urbanos da América Latina e onde há circulação do DEN-313. Apesar do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil recomendar, há mais de três décadas, a vacinação contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela nas populações residentes na região Norte do País, especialmente aquelas residentes nas pequenas localidades ou em áreas de floresta nativa, onde há maior risco de exposição ao ciclo silvestre do vírus da febre amarela24, somente 27,2% da população estudada tinha soroproteção contra o vírus amaralíco na amostra sérica de agosto de 1999. Isto tem ainda maior relevância, porque é sabido que as pessoas vacinadas mantém títulos de anticorpos protetores por longos períodos de tempo15, mesmo entre residentes de áreas sem programa regular de vacinação22. Por outro lado, a baixa freqüência (27,2%) de portadores de anticorpos anti-17D mostrou não só a vulnerabilidade da população ao vírus da febre amarela, antes da campanha de vacinação em massa de 1999, bem como os precários resultados obtidos com as medidas governamentais até então praticadas. No entanto, nas amostras séricas de três meses após a vacinação em massa contra o vírus 17D, em outubro de 1999, a soroconversão observada foi de 89,7% entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos. Nessa Campanha Estadual de Vacinação, do Governo do Estado do Acre e com o apoio da Fundação Nacional de Saúde, foram vacinadas 416.267 pessoas em todo o Estado, correspondendo à época a 82,6% da população estimada como não-imune (n=504.023), excluindo os menores de 6 meses de idade e as gestantes. Portanto, essas taxas de cobertura vacinal (82,6%) e de soroconversão (89,7%), bem como o contingente de pessoas previamente imunes (27,2%), tornam possível especular que a quase totalidade das pessoas residentes no Estado do Acre em outubro de 1999 esteja imune contra o vírus da febre amarela. Isto provavelmente ocorreu de modo uniforme, no grupo populacional com indicação de receber a vacina, considerando as distribuições semelhantes de sexo e idade dos portadores de anticorpos anti-17D em janeiro de 2000. Ao contrário do observado entre aqueles pesquisados em agosto de 1999, quando predominaram as pessoas do sexo masculino e de maior idade, o que pode evidenciar o efeito dessas pessoas saberem ser mais expostas ao ciclo silvestre da febre amarela e, conseqüentemente, buscaram mais a vacinação. Não obstante, seria mais indicado o teste de neutralização (TN), por ser mais sensível e específico, para avaliar a soroconversão pela vacina antiamarílica e usando como substrato cultura de células ou camundongos recém-nascidos (PFC Vasconcelos, informação pessoal). No entanto, o TN, se comparado ao teste de inibição da hemaglutinação, tem como principais limitações em estudos soro- epidemiológicos o custo mais elevado e também, especialmente se for usados camundongos recém-nascidos, o tempo despedido para conclusão dos exames sorológicos, além de requerer biotério com capacidade de fornecer grande número de animais. O custo-benefício da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal na população da cidade de Rio Branco, e por extensão do Estado do Acre, deve ser também avaliado considerando a proteção duradoura oferecida por essa vacina, ou de pelo menos 10 anos15, e o atual risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela11, o que tem merecido reiterados alertas as autoridades de saúde do Brasil5 11 16 24, decorrente da elevada dispersão do Ae. aegypti em grande parte das cidades brasileiras, à semelhança do observado nas áreas de maior densidade populacional do Estado do Acre. Adicionalmente, em todo o Estado do Acre não ocorreu aumento da incidência de encefalopatias, de encefalites ou de outro evento adverso conhecido25 nos dias subseqüentes à aplicação em massa da vacina 17D (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Entre as 416.267 pessoas vacinadas contra o 17D em outubro de 1999, em todo o Estado do Acre, somente foi notificado um caso (homem, de 26 anos, previamente sadio) que desenvolveu abscesso piogênico no local da aplicação da vacina, que evoluiu para sepse e faleceu, dezesseis dias após a vacinação, com falência múltipla de órgãos (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Provavelmente pelo efeito do viés de recordação, não houve diferença da soropositividade para o 17D entre aqueles com ou sem história de vacinação prévia a agosto de 1999. Ao contrário, possivelmente por ser um evento mais recente, a história de vacinação (em outubro de 1999) foi muito mais lembrada pelos Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 6 soropositivos para o 17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000. Contudo, além do baixo valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação, observada no levantamento de agosto de 1999, não é hábito da população guardar a caderneta de vacinação ou mesmo levá-la à unidade de imunização por ocasião da aplicação de uma nova dose de vacina, isto porque somente uma (0,3%) pessoa a apresentou quando da aplicação da primeira dose (agosto de 1999) da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Essa situação fica ainda mais evidente ao constatar que somente 39,5% das pessoas tinham aquela caderneta em janeiro de 2000, ou seja, isto após 5 meses do início da Campanha Estadual de Intensificação do Calendário de Imunizações, que mobilizou ampla parcela da população do Estado do Acre, e com maciça divulgação nos vários tipos de mídia. Como estes resultados observados sobre a caderneta de vacinação são semelhantes aos descritos nos Estados da Bahia20 e de Minas Gerais1, há fortes indícios sobre a inadequação dessa prática de registro e, por isto mesmo, os gestores do Sistema Único de Saúde deveriam estudar melhor estratégia de registro e/ou de armazenamento de dados, de mais fácil verificação, e que cobrisse, ao menos, as vacinas constantes do Programa Nacional de Imunização. Em conclusão, a população estudada tem aparentemente menor exposição aos arbovírus mais prevalentes na região amazônica brasileira e, apesar de potencialmente mais exposta ao vírus da febre amarela, tinha, antes da campanha de vacinação, baixa taxa de cobertura vacinal contra o vírus 17D. De outro lado, os índices atuais de infestação do Ae aegypti, os determinantes econômicos e sócioculturais e a evidência sorológica de circulação do DEN-3, tornam a população do Estado do Acre potencialmente exposta a outra epidemia de dengue pelo sorotipo 3 (DEN-3).

Das 390 pessoas incluídas na primeira fase do estudo (agosto de 1999), somente 190 compareceram em janeiro de 2000, três meses após a aplicação da vacina 17D (outubro de 1999). Nas amostras da primeira fase, as freqüências de soropositivos (IH) para os vírus estudados foram: 17D (27,2%); Dengue-1 (0,3%); Dengue-2 (4,1%); Dengue-3 (0%); Dengue-4 (0%), entre outros 8 vírus. Nas amostras séricas de janeiro (2000), a soroconversão para o 17D foi de 89,7% (130/145) e 3,2% (6/ 190) passaram a ter anticorpos contra o sorotipo 3 (DEN-3). Em conclusão, por conta da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal e de soroconversão há redução significativa do risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela na cidade de Rio Branco, apesar de não ser desprezível a possibilidade de uma nova epidemia de dengue, pelo DEN-3, a semelhança da registrada em 2000 e 2001 pelos sorotipos 1 e 2.

ABSTRACT During a yellow fever vaccination campaign among residents of Rio Branco (Acre State), the frequency of HI antibodies to the most prevalent arboviruses in the Amazon region and to yellow fever virus was determined before and three months after immunization with YF 17D vaccine. From 390 inhabitants included in the first phase of serologic survey (August 1999), only 190 provided a second serum sample, after the use of 17D vaccine (January 2000). Among first phase samples, the frequency of HI antibodies was: 17D (27.2%); Ilheus (5.9%); Mayaro (5.4%); Caraparu (4.9%); Dengue-2 (4.1%); Oropouche (2.3%); and Dengue-1 (0.3%). In the second study phase, the serologic conversion to YF reached 89.7% among previously negative persons. Serologic conversions were also observed to Ilheus (6.2%); Dengue-3 (3.2%); Mayaro (1.1%); and Oropouche (1.1%) viruses. In conclusion, considering the high YF antibody rate after vaccination, the risk of urban yellow fever seems insignificant, although the lower prevalence of HI antibodies to dengue viruses, is of concern and inhabitants are under high risk of dengue outbreaks, especially to DEN-3 recently introduced in Brazil, as was observed in 2000 and 2001 with DEN-1 and DEN-2.

Não obstante, na população do Estado do Acre há uma lacuna no conhecimento sobre a soroepidemiologia dos arbovírus e o impacto na Saúde Pública17, apesar das condições epidemiológicas favoráveis à circulação de arbovírus em decorrência das extensas áreas de florestas tropicais nativas e da grande biodiversidade. Nessa região do Brasil, os estudos arbovirológicos ficaram restritos às investigações iniciais sobre a Febre Negra de Lábrea6 e de tentativas de isolamento viral em animais (aves, répteis e mosquitos) coletados no município de Sena Madureira7 8. Mais recentemente, em janeiro de 2001, ocorreu a incidência máxima da epidemia de dengue pelos sorotipos 1 e 2 (DEN-1 e DEN-2) nas cidades do Vale do Rio Acre, especialmente na capital do Estado (Rio Branco). Isto, após o registro crescente de casos de dengue ao longo do segundo semestre de 20004. Anteriormente, em novembro de 1999, houve registro dos primeiros casos de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija, vizinha às cidades acreanas de Brasiléia e Epitaciolância4. Essa situação do Estado do Acre motivou o presente estudo soroepidemiológico sobre os principais arbovírus descritos na região amazônica, em uma amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco, antes (agosto de 1999) da vacinação em massa contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (17D) em 10 de outubro de 1999 e da ocorrência da epidemia de dengue em 2000/2001. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS No primeiro dia da Campanha Estadual de Vacinação contra o vírus da hepatite B (VHB), em 14 de agosto de 1999, foram selecionadas 394 pessoas residentes na área urbana da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), com 2 ou mais anos de idade, entre aquelas que compareceram a um dos 212 Postos de Vacinação (temporários) da cidade. Em cada Posto de Vacinação foi selecionada de uma a duas pessoas para coleta da amostra sangüínea e levantamento de informações demográficas e sobre a vacinação prévia contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela, após conhecer os objetivos da pesquisa e assinar o termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido. A primeira pessoa selecionada era aquela da fila para vacinação que estava sendo atendida (ainda na fase de preenchimento dos dados pessoais), quando da chegada da equipe da pesquisa ao Posto de Vacinação. Nos Postos de Vacinação com mais de 30 pessoas na fila, foi selecionada a outra pessoa subseqüente na fila, desde que não-membro da família da primeira. Quando houve recusa de alguma pessoa (no total de dois casos), foi incluída a pessoa seguinte na fila para vacinação2. Em seguida ao preenchimento do questionário, foram coletados de 8 a 10ml de sangue venoso sem anticoagulante. Em seguida, as amostras sangüíneas foram centrifugadas e estocadas (-20o C) no LACEN- AC, onde foram conservadas até o envio para o Laboratório de Arbovírus do Instituto Evandro Chagas (Belém, PA), para a pesquisa de anticorpos inibidores da hemaglutinação (IH), pela técnica de Clarke & Casals modificada por Shope21, dos seguintes arbovírus: Alphavirus da família Togaviridae (vírus Mayaro e Mucambo); Flavivirus da família Flaviviridae (vírus Ilhéus, Rocio, Dengue-1, Dengue-2, Dengue-3, Dengue-4, Saint Louis e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela, 17D); e Bunyavirus da família Bunyaviridae (vírus Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu). Esses 13 vírus, nem todos são estritamente arbovírus10, foram estudados usando soros-controles, positivos e negativos, padronizados pelo IEC (Belém, PA) e considerando soropositivo a amostra com título recíproco ≥20. Os soropositivos para os sorotipos do vírus da dengue foram considerados como resposta primária ou secundária, de acordo com os critérios da Organização Panamericana de Saúde14: ( i) primária, quando o t í tulo recíproco era <1.280 e, simultaneamente, havia ausência de resposta ou títulos 4 vezes menores para os demais sorotipos do dengue ou outros flavivírus; e (ii) secundária, títulos recíprocos iguais ou maiores a 1.280 para todos os sorotipos do dengue e/ou outros flavivírus. A segunda etapa do estudo foi realizada três (3) meses depois, entre os dias 19 a 21 de janeiro de 2000, após a aplicação da vacina contra o 17D (BIOMANGUINHOS®, Rio de Janeiro) no dia 10 de outubro de 2000 em toda a população do Estado do Acre. Oito dias antes do início da segunda etapa, todos os participantes do estudo (n=394) foram convidados, por carta, pela Secretaria de Estado de Sáude e Saneamento do Estado (SESSACRE) para nova coleta de sangue, sendo esclarecido qual o objetivo do estudo (pesquisa sorológica do marcador anti-HBs do VHB e anti-17D), e o motivo, ambos descritos em linguagem acessível ao grande público. Na mesma carta-convite, foi solicitado que a pessoa ou responsável legal levasse a caderneta de vacinação, entregue em agosto de 1999, ou atualizada em outubro e dezembro de 1999 por ocasião, respectivamente, da primeira, segunda (+ a vacina 17D) e terceira doses da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Nessa segunda etapa, após a coleta de nova amostra sangüínea, foram seguidos os mesmos procedimentos anteriores, e preenchido o segundo módulo do questionário (dados pessoais, história de vacinação nos meses anteriores e exame da caderneta de vacinação). Por ocasião da segunda etapa do estudo, ainda não eram conhecidos os resultados dos exames sorológicos da primeira amostra sérica. As análises estatísticas foram realizadas com auxílio do “software” Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Na análise dos resultados, as pessoas naturais do Estado do Acre e nascidas em municípios da região oriental foram incluídas como sendo da região do Vale do Rio Acre, enquanto que aquelas nascidas em municípios da região central e ocidental do Estado como do Vale do Rio Juruá. Para as variáveis contínuas foram determinadas a média, o desvio-padrão e a mediana, enquanto para as variáveis categóricas as medidas de freqüência. As associações foram consideradas estatisticamente significantes se a probabilidade do erro α foi ≤0,05 (p≤5%). RESULTADOS Das 394 pessoas incluídas no estudo, quatro foram excluídas porque a primeira amostra sérica foi perdida durante o processamento laboratorial ou por ocasião do transporte até Belém (PA). Na segunda etapa do estudo, somente atenderam ao convite 190 (48,7%) pessoas. Os resultados da pesquisa sorológica na 3 Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 primeira (de agosto de 1999) e na segunda (de janeiro de 2000) amostras séricas estão descritos na Tabela 1. Todas as respostas sorológicas foram do tipo primária, exceto em 21,7% (23/106) dos 17D-positivos (agosto de 1999) e que foi secundária para dois ou mais flavivírus. Na Tabela 2, foi comparado o resultado sorológico dentre as variáveis demográficas pesquisadas (sexo e idade), tanto nas pessoas com anticorpos contra o 17D (em agosto de 1999) como para o conjunto daqueles com anticorpos para os arbovírus pesquisados em agosto de 1999. Nesse último grupo, a pessoa amostrada somente foi considerada uma vez e excluindo aquelas com anticorpos para o vírus 17D. Por isto, dos 203 soropositivos (106 para o 17D e 97 para os outros arbovírus), somente foram incluídas 80 pessoas, ou seja, 17 (80 + 17=97) pessoas tinham anticorpos para 2 (n=13) ou 3 (n=4) dos arbovírus investigados. Desse modo, foi possível mostrar na Tabela 2 que antes da intervenção (vacina contra a febre amarela), havia a predominância significante (p<0,05) de pessoas soropositivas para o 17D do sexo masculino (31,9% vs 22,8%), mas que após a vacinação as freqüências (respectivamente, 93,1% vs 91,3%) de soroconvertidos foram semelhantes (p>0,62). Em relação ao estudo sorológico da amostra de agosto de 1999, as pessoas do sexo masculino foram também mais freqüentemente (p<0,005) soropositivas (26,6% vs 14,8%) para o conjunto de arbovírus. Quanto à idade, os soropositivos para o 17D em agosto de 1999 (p<0,001) e para o conjunto dos arbovírus (p<0,001) apresentaram médias de idade significativamente maiores (Tabela 2). No entanto, entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos (n=145), na amostra de agosto de 1999 e também avaliados em janeiro de 2000, foram semelhantes (p>0,46) as médias das idades dos soropositivos e negativos (Tabela 2). Tabela 2 - Resultados das pesquisas de anticorpos contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (17D), antes (1999) e depois (2000) da campanha de vacinação, e para o conjunto dos arbovírus pesquisados em Rio Branco (Acre), segundo o sexo e a idade. 17D (1999) 17D (2000) Arbovírus1 total no (%) total no (%) total no (%) Sexo feminino 202 46 (22,8) 103 94 (91,3) 202 30 (14,8) masculino 188 60 (31,9) 87 81 (93,1) 188 50 (26,6) p <0,05 >0,62 <0,005 Idade, Média (± DP) negativo 24,1 (± 13,3) 19,2 (± 13,6) 24,9 (± 14,4) positivo 32,9 (± 17,0) 18,4 (± 11,2) 32,6 (± 15,3) p <0,001 >0,46 <0,001 1conjunto de arbovírus estudados. Não foi estudado o tempo de residência no Estado do Acre, mas a distribuição do resultado sorológico para o conjunto dos arbovírus pesquisados teve freqüências de soropositivos semelhantes (p>0,18) quanto à naturalidade: Estado do Acre (19,6% ou 62/316); outros Estados amazônicos (16,7% ou 6/36) ou de outras unidades federadas (31,6% ou 12/38). Também, entre os naturais do Estado do Acre (n=316), não foram observadas diferenças significantes (p>0,20) nas freqüências de soropositivos (conjunto de arbovírus) entre aqueles naturais de municípios do Vale do Acre (18,3% ou 47/257) versus os do Vale do Juruá (25,4% ou 15/59). Entre os naturais do Vale do Acre (n=257), grande parte (80,9%; n=208) era da cidade de Rio Branco. O valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação prévia, em relação à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D nas amostras de agosto de 1999, foi baixo - de 30,6% (64/209) -, ao contrário do valor Tabela 1 - Freqüências de anticorpos contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (FA-17D) e arbovírus em moradores da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), antes (agosto de 1999) e depois da vacinação contra o 17D (outubro, 2000).

Entre os soronegativos (n=284) compareceram na segunda etapa 145 (51,1%) pessoas e do grupo de soropositivos (n=106) 45 (42,4%) atenderam o convite, sendo essas diferenças sem significado estatístico (χ²=2,78; p>0,09). Na segunda etapa, a soroconversão (três meses após a vacina 17D) foi de 89,7% (130/ 145) e os 45 soropositivos (da amostra de agosto de 1999), pesquisados em janeiro de 2000, tiveram o mesmo resultado sorológico anterior. A soroprevalência dos portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus pesquisados (Tabela 1), foi inferior a 6%, inclusive para o Oropouche (2,3%), Mayaro (5,4%) e Ilhéus (5,9%), entre outros. Chama a atenção, as freqüências de soropositivos, nas amostras de agosto de 1999, contra os sorotipos do vírus da dengue, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 e DEN-4, respectivamente: 0,3%; 4,1%; 0% e 0%. No entanto, cinco meses após (janeiro de 2000) da primeira amostra sangüínea (em agosto de 1999), todos os soronegativos (DEN-1, DEN-2 e DEN-3) pesquisados assim permaneceram, mas 3,2% (6/190) daqueles soronegativos para o DEN-3 ficaram soropositivos (Tabela 1). Em tempo semelhante, também foi observada soroconversão para os arbovírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%). 4 preditivo-negativo de 77,4% (89/115), mas as diferenças observadas (Tabela 3) não alcançaram significância estatística (p>0,24). Quando foi levantada a história de vacinação contra o vírus vacinal 17D, em outubro de 1999, e comparada à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000, o valor preditivo- positivo foi elevado de 92,1% (152/165), sendo baixo (8,3%) o valor preditivo-negativo (Tabela 3). A Tabela 3 também mostra que foi muito baixa (0,3%) a freqüência de pessoas que portavam a caderneta de vacinação, quando da primeira dose da Campanha Estadual (agosto de 1999) e que em janeiro de 2000, cinco meses após, somente 39,5% apresentaram a caderneta de vacinação, mas sendo semelhante (p>0,60) a proporção de soropositivos entre os portadores da caderneta (93,3%) e os não-portadores (91,3%). Nenhuma pessoa, com história de vacinação (17D) em outubro de 1999 e pesquisada em janeiro de 2000, referiu qualquer agravo à saúde nos três meses subseqüentes ou a algum evento adverso, relacionado à vacina, de intensidade moderada ou grave. DISCUSSÃO Esse é o primeiro estudo realizado no Estado do Acre, sobre a prevalência de portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus mais prevalentes na região Norte do Brasil17 18 19. Talvez, pela procedência e naturalidade predominantemente urbana da amostra populacional, a freqüência de soropositivos (<6%) para grande parte dos vírus estudados (Mayaro, Mucambo, Ilhéus, Rocio, Saint Louis, Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu) foi inferior à esperada, considerando os resultados de outros estudos sorológicos realizados na região amazônica17. É preciso considerar que não devem ser raros os prováveis contatos (e.g. lazer e ocupacionais) com áreas de florestas nativas, inclusive entre aqueles nascidos na cidade de Rio Branco, o que muito mais provavelmente ocorre entre os nascidos em cidades de menor porte do Estado do Acre. No entanto, o encontro de mais soropositivos (31,6% vs <20%) entre os não-naturais de Estados amazônicos, apesar da ausência de significado estatístico, pode evidenciar a maior exposição desses migrantes em atividades extrativistas ou vinculadas à agricultura ou à agroindústria. Na população estudada, a soroconversão observada para os vírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%), entre a primeira e a segunda amostra sérica, evidencia a provável circulação desses vírus ou outro(s) antigenicamente relacionado(s). Considerando as características da população avaliada, especialmente o efeito da amplitude da faixa etária e do maior contingente de naturais da cidade de Rio Branco, essas incidências, no período de 5 meses, podem ser classificadas como de valores entre médios a elevados. No entanto, na região Norte do Brasil, não há conhecimento sobre estudo avaliando a incidência de alguma infecção por arbovírus. Coerentemente, as pessoas com anticorpos para o conjunto dos arbovírus estudados foram mais freqüentemente do sexo masculino e de maior idade, evidenciando provavelmente a maior exposição dessas pessoas às áreas de maior circulação dos vírus estudados, onde são próprias para as atividades ocupacionais extrativistas, agrícolas ou de lazer (e. g. caça e pesca). Em publicações anteriores, a freqüência de soropositivos para anticorpos contra esses arbovírus aumentou, proporcionalmente, ao aumento da idade9 22 23, o que pode ter associação com o tempo de maior exposição nas atividades de maior risco para adquirir a infecção. No entanto, quanto ao sexo, as observações são variáveis conforme a população estudada22 e, talvez isto se explique, por questões de gênero ou, mais especificamente, porque as mulheres têm menos rotineiramente atividades vinculadas às áreas de floresta tropical.

No entanto, em novembro de 1999, houve os primeiros registros de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija4. Portanto, as soroprevalências dos DEN-1 (0,3%) e DEN-2 (4,1%) observadas nas amostras de agosto de 1999, provavelmente, espelham aquele momento epidemiológico. Já no ano 2000, na cidade de Rio Branco foram notificados 2.178 casos de dengue, especialmente nos meses de novembro (n=326) e dezembro (n=525), e com a confirmação de 1.283 casos (SESSACRE, dados não-publicados). Também no ano 2000, de janeiro a dezembro, os índices de infestação predial pelo Aedes aegypti na cidade de Rio Branco variaram de 0% a 16,47% (média de 3,5%), conforme o bairro pesquisado (SESSACRE-DABS, dados não-publicados). Quando do segundo levantamento soroepidemiológico (janeiro de 2000), a curva epidêmica da dengue poderia estar com a incidência de nível endêmico, mas não ainda em fase de progressão ou que pode ter começado a ocorrer no segundo semestre de 2000. Porque, não só considerando o conhecimento sobre as curvas epidêmicas da dengue23, os casos notificados foram mais freqüentes a partir de novembro e dezembro de 2000 e a incidência máxima da epidemia na terceira semana epidemiológica (janeiro) de 2001, simultaneamente pelos sorotipos DEN-1 e DEN-2, quando foram confirmados 410 dos 445 casos notificados na cidade de Rio Branco4. Mais recentemente, nas cidades de Brasiléia e Epitaciolândia, na divisa com a cidade de Cobija (Bolívia), também foram confirmados casos autóctones de DEN-1 e DEN-24. Por isto, vale ressaltar a observação dos 6 (3,2%) casos com anticorpos contra o sorotipo DEN-3 em janeiro de 2000, sendo anteriormente (agosto de 1999) soronegativos para esse mesmo sorotipo. Oficialmente, o DEN-3 foi isolado no Brasil em dezembro de 2000 na cidade do Rio de Janeiro12, seguido por isolamentos subseqüentes ou de epidemias em populações de cidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil3. Portanto, o registro de soropositivos (IH) para o DEN-3 em amostras séricas extraídas em janeiro de 2000 é digno de nota, especialmente porque foram em pessoas residentes em região distante daquelas localidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil. Contudo, vale também ressaltar, apesar do isolamento geográfico do Estado do Acre, muitas das cidades do Vale do Acre, inclusive Rio Branco, têm grande intercâmbio de pessoas e mercadorias com a cidade de Cobija (Estado de Pando, Bolívia), onde há aeroporto internacional e com possibilidade de comunicação aérea com outros centros urbanos da América Latina e onde há circulação do DEN-313. Apesar do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil recomendar, há mais de três décadas, a vacinação contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela nas populações residentes na região Norte do País, especialmente aquelas residentes nas pequenas localidades ou em áreas de floresta nativa, onde há maior risco de exposição ao ciclo silvestre do vírus da febre amarela24, somente 27,2% da população estudada tinha soroproteção contra o vírus amaralíco na amostra sérica de agosto de 1999. Isto tem ainda maior relevância, porque é sabido que as pessoas vacinadas mantém títulos de anticorpos protetores por longos períodos de tempo15, mesmo entre residentes de áreas sem programa regular de vacinação22. Por outro lado, a baixa freqüência (27,2%) de portadores de anticorpos anti-17D mostrou não só a vulnerabilidade da população ao vírus da febre amarela, antes da campanha de vacinação em massa de 1999, bem como os precários resultados obtidos com as medidas governamentais até então praticadas. No entanto, nas amostras séricas de três meses após a vacinação em massa contra o vírus 17D, em outubro de 1999, a soroconversão observada foi de 89,7% entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos. Nessa Campanha Estadual de Vacinação, do Governo do Estado do Acre e com o apoio da Fundação Nacional de Saúde, foram vacinadas 416.267 pessoas em todo o Estado, correspondendo à época a 82,6% da população estimada como não-imune (n=504.023), excluindo os menores de 6 meses de idade e as gestantes. Portanto, essas taxas de cobertura vacinal (82,6%) e de soroconversão (89,7%), bem como o contingente de pessoas previamente imunes (27,2%), tornam possível especular que a quase totalidade das pessoas residentes no Estado do Acre em outubro de 1999 esteja imune contra o vírus da febre amarela. Isto provavelmente ocorreu de modo uniforme, no grupo populacional com indicação de receber a vacina, considerando as distribuições semelhantes de sexo e idade dos portadores de anticorpos anti-17D em janeiro de 2000. Ao contrário do observado entre aqueles pesquisados em agosto de 1999, quando predominaram as pessoas do sexo masculino e de maior idade, o que pode evidenciar o efeito dessas pessoas saberem ser mais expostas ao ciclo silvestre da febre amarela e, conseqüentemente, buscaram mais a vacinação. Não obstante, seria mais indicado o teste de neutralização (TN), por ser mais sensível e específico, para avaliar a soroconversão pela vacina antiamarílica e usando como substrato cultura de células ou camundongos recém-nascidos (PFC Vasconcelos, informação pessoal). No entanto, o TN, se comparado ao teste de inibição da hemaglutinação, tem como principais limitações em estudos soro- epidemiológicos o custo mais elevado e também, especialmente se for usados camundongos recém-nascidos, o tempo despedido para conclusão dos exames sorológicos, além de requerer biotério com capacidade de fornecer grande número de animais. O custo-benefício da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal na população da cidade de Rio Branco, e por extensão do Estado do Acre, deve ser também avaliado considerando a proteção duradoura oferecida por essa vacina, ou de pelo menos 10 anos15, e o atual risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela11, o que tem merecido reiterados alertas as autoridades de saúde do Brasil5 11 16 24, decorrente da elevada dispersão do Ae. aegypti em grande parte das cidades brasileiras, à semelhança do observado nas áreas de maior densidade populacional do Estado do Acre. Adicionalmente, em todo o Estado do Acre não ocorreu aumento da incidência de encefalopatias, de encefalites ou de outro evento adverso conhecido25 nos dias subseqüentes à aplicação em massa da vacina 17D (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Entre as 416.267 pessoas vacinadas contra o 17D em outubro de 1999, em todo o Estado do Acre, somente foi notificado um caso (homem, de 26 anos, previamente sadio) que desenvolveu abscesso piogênico no local da aplicação da vacina, que evoluiu para sepse e faleceu, dezesseis dias após a vacinação, com falência múltipla de órgãos (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Provavelmente pelo efeito do viés de recordação, não houve diferença da soropositividade para o 17D entre aqueles com ou sem história de vacinação prévia a agosto de 1999. Ao contrário, possivelmente por ser um evento mais recente, a história de vacinação (em outubro de 1999) foi muito mais lembrada pelos Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 6 soropositivos para o 17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000. Contudo, além do baixo valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação, observada no levantamento de agosto de 1999, não é hábito da população guardar a caderneta de vacinação ou mesmo levá-la à unidade de imunização por ocasião da aplicação de uma nova dose de vacina, isto porque somente uma (0,3%) pessoa a apresentou quando da aplicação da primeira dose (agosto de 1999) da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Essa situação fica ainda mais evidente ao constatar que somente 39,5% das pessoas tinham aquela caderneta em janeiro de 2000, ou seja, isto após 5 meses do início da Campanha Estadual de Intensificação do Calendário de Imunizações, que mobilizou ampla parcela da população do Estado do Acre, e com maciça divulgação nos vários tipos de mídia. Como estes resultados observados sobre a caderneta de vacinação são semelhantes aos descritos nos Estados da Bahia20 e de Minas Gerais1, há fortes indícios sobre a inadequação dessa prática de registro e, por isto mesmo, os gestores do Sistema Único de Saúde deveriam estudar melhor estratégia de registro e/ou de armazenamento de dados, de mais fácil verificação, e que cobrisse, ao menos, as vacinas constantes do Programa Nacional de Imunização. Em conclusão, a população estudada tem aparentemente menor exposição aos arbovírus mais prevalentes na região amazônica brasileira e, apesar de potencialmente mais exposta ao vírus da febre amarela, tinha, antes da campanha de vacinação, baixa taxa de cobertura vacinal contra o vírus 17D. De outro lado, os índices atuais de infestação do Ae aegypti, os determinantes econômicos e sócioculturais e a evidência sorológica de circulação do DEN-3, tornam a população do Estado do Acre potencialmente exposta a outra epidemia de dengue pelo sorotipo 3 (DEN-3).

(1976), 8 (3), 1 13-1 17 I13 Encephalitis Caused by Louping ill Virus in a Group of Horses in Ireland P. J. TIMONEY AND W. J. C. DONNELLY Veterinary Research Laboratory, Abbotstown, Castleknock, Co. Dublin L. 0. CLEMENTS AND M. FENLON Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Knockalisheen, Limerick INTRODUCTION LOUPING ill (LI), traditionally a disease of sheep and less frequently cattle, occurs in Scotland, northern England, Wales and Ireland. The aetiological agent is a flavivirus which is transmitted under natural conditions by the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. Although clinical LI has previously been described in the horse (Fletcher, 1937), there have been no virologically confirmed cases reported in this species. A limited serological survey to determine the prevalence of serum neutralising antibodies to LI virus in horses in Ireland, disclosed a positive rate of 10.6 per cent, indicating a moderate infection rate in animals of mixed breed and of different environmental backgrounds (Timoney, 1974). This paper contains a description of an outbreak of LI in a group of free range horses and the isolation of a virus, antigenically indistinguishable from a reference strain of LI virus, from the brain and spinal cord of one of the animals. It has already been the subject of a preliminary report (Timoney, Donnelly, Clements and Fenlon, 1974). CLINICAL HISTORY The group of horses in which LI was confirmed comprised a 12 year old (y.0.) hunter, a 3 y.0. ?,-bred mare, a 3 y.0. draft mare and a 3 y.0. h-bred mare. The animals which were unbroken and scarcely handled since they were foals, were grazing on a farm of reclaimed land in Co. Clare. Almost 15 years previously losses from LI infection had occurred in sheep on this farm. The horses involved in the present outbreak were checked daily for signs of ill health. Case I Clinical signs were first noticed in the &-bred mare when inspected at 06.30 h on 30.4.74. At rest there were generalised muscular tremors, most pronounced in the left forelimb which also tended to knuckle over. The animal moved reluctantly when approached and muscular tremors recommenced when she stopped. On the following day the mare was recumbent and when forced to rise would walk a short distance and lie down again. Five to 6 hours later, she had difficulty in rising and exhibited hyperexcitability, incoordination and opisthotonus. An hour afterwards the mare was caught for the first time and became so excited that she was given as a sedative, an intravenous injection of magnesium sulphate. She died 10 minutes later approx- imately 32 hours after the initial symptoms were detected. Case 2 At the end of April, the 3 y.0. &-bred mare developed a peculiar gait and when in motion, stretched out her neck in an exaggerated extended position. However, these clinical signs subsided in a short time. The owner felt that had the &bred mare not been sick, the transient symptoms shown by the &-bred mare would have passed unnoticed. Case 3 During the second week in May, the 3 y.0. draft mare was observed remaining apart from the other horses. The animal had been losing condition for over a month. The mare tended to lie down a lot and when roused, would adopt a dog-sitting position. Having gained her feet she would take some time steadying herself and occasionally experienced generalised muscular tremors. At times, the mare would stagger around but at no stage were hyperexcitability, opisthotonus, or paddling of the limbs evident. The mare was often recumbent during the week preceding her death which occurred on 22.5.74. The duration of the illness was approximately 10-12 days. FIN DI NGS POST-MORTEM AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL In Case 1 there were interlobular pulmonary oedema and serosanguineous pleural exudate. The meningeal blood vessels were congested. An ulcerative typhlitis associated with many Anoplocephala perfoliata was present in both cases, and was the only macroscopic abnormality observed in Case 3. The entire brain from Case 1 and one half of the brain from Case 3 were fixed in 10 per cent formol saline for histopath- ological examination. The remainder of the brain from Case 3 was immersed in 50 per cent glycerol saline for virological examination. After fixation, blocks of cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla, and cervical cord from both cases, were processed to paraffin. Sections were cut at 7 pm and were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) were typical of those encountered in viral encephalitides, namely neuronal degeneration, focal gliosis and peri- vascular lymphoid infiltration. I I4 Case I Congestion, perivascular lymphoid infiltration and glial nodules were present at all levels of the CNS examined. Glial nodules were particularly numerous in the midbrain, around the cerebral aqueduct (fig. I ) and in the red nuclei. The oculomotor nuclei were unaffected. Some of the cerebellar folia were severely involved with marked perivascular haemorrhages in- volving both the granular layer and the white matter (fig. 2) . Haemorrhages were also present in the medulla and spinal cord. EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL thalamus, cerebellar vermis, pons, medulla just anterior to the obex, and cervical cord at the level of the first cervical vertebra. The suspending medium was Eagle's minimal essential medium with 20 per cent foetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Virus isolation was attempted by the intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of each suspension into a group of 8, 1-2 day old albino Swiss mice. Fig. 3.

Cerebellum from Case 1 showing perivascular lymphoid cufing and haemorrhages in white matter ( I ) and granular layer (2) . ( H E , x 300). Case 3 Lesions in this case were less pronounced. The midbrain was most severely affected with perivascular infiltration and glial nodules particularly in the central grey matter (fig. 3). In the cerebellum, there were areas of Purkinje cell loss accompanied by diffuse glial reaction and endothelial reactivity in the molecular layer (fig. 4). Lesions in the medulla and cervical cord were sparse. Some perivascular cuffing and satellitosis were present in the medulla and a few glial nodules in the white matter of the cervical cord. There was some post-mortem degeneration in the tissues from this case. 12 VIROLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS Virus Isolation Clarified 10 per cent suspensions were separately prepared from 6 areas of the brain of Case 2, the 3 y.0. draft mare. These included : anterior cerebral cortex. Fig. 4. Cerebellum from Case 3 showing loss of Piirkinje cells, glial reaction in molecular layer and reactive blood vessel (arrow). ( H E , x 300). Two mice in each of the 3 groups injected with pons, medulla, and cervical cord suspensions became sick 5-6 days after inoculation. Re-isolation of the virus, designated 74/E/61, from the same areas of the horse brain were successful. Weanling mice inoculated with the isolate by the i.c. and intraperitoneal routes, all developed posterior paraplegia by the sixth day post inoculation. Virus Characterisation and Identification Haemagglutinating ( H A ) activity. Crude alkaline aqueous antigens prepared from first and second passage mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 virus were tested fcr HA activity over pH range 5.8-6.8 and each was negative. However, a haemagglutinin of titre ! /320, was sub- sequently obtained from second passage infective mouse brain using sucrose-acetone and acetone-ether extraction procedures. The preparation of crude and purified antigens and the techniaue of HA titration were as deschbed by Clarke and 'Casals (1958) adapted to the , microtechnique of Sever (1962). EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL Mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid was produced against 74/E/61 virus after the method of Brandt, Buescher and Hetrick (1967). The equine isolate was preliminarily identified as a strain of LI virus using the gel diffusion (GD) test (Papadopoulos, Anslow and Hanson, 1970). Lines of complete identity were obtained with low passage mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 virus and suckling mouse brain infected with the More- dun strain of LI virus. The identity of the equine isolate was confirmed in cross complement-fixation (CF) tests (Bradstreet and Taylor, 1962) and in cross haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests (Clarke and Casals, 1958). Cross neutralisation tests were undertaken to determine the extent of the antigenic similarity between 74/E/61 virus and the Moredun strain of LI virus. The test method has previously been described (Timoney, 1974). The results of cross neutralisation tests revealed that both reference and 74/E/61 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable, with homologous and heterologous neutralisation indices differing by less than one log of virus neutralised (Table I ) .

Serological Testing Blood samples were collected from the $-bred mare and the hunter on 21.5.74 and 9.6.74 and from the draft mare on 21.5.74, the day preceding its death. Antibody to 74/E/61 virus was detected in all of the sera using the neutralisation, CF, HI and G D tests. There were significant rises in titre between first and second samples in the case of the &bred mare and the hunter (Table 11). DISCUSSION Although there is serological evidence of LI infection in horses in Ireland (Timoney, 1974), clinical disease associated with such infections is very uncommon. It is interesting to compare the clinical features of this outbreak with those described in other recorded cases of experimental or natural LI infection in the horse (Alexander and Neitz, 1935; Fletcher, 1937). In both instances, there was no attendant mortality. Alexander and Neitz (1935) experimentally infected 2 horses with LI virus by infesting them with infected Rhipicephalus appendiculutus nymphs. One animal was afebrile and showed only slight paresis, which appeared 2 weeks after challenge and persisted for several weeks. The second animal developed a biphasic fever, was anorexic, Horse ~ 3 y .0 . draft mare* ~~ 3 y.0. 4-bred mare 12 y.0. hunter I Serological Test 32 32 128 I28 _ _ _ I ~ HI 20: ~ ~ 40 40 20 80 ~ - Positive (weak) Positive Positive Positive * Horse died 22.5.74 and LI virus isolated from brain. t Protective serum titre expressed as no. weanling mouse i.c.

No nervous signs appeared and the horse made an uneventful recovery. In the clinical report by Fletcher (1937), a 2 y.0. Clydesdale colt grazing on hill pasture with 2 other horses developed stiffness in gait, especially in the hind limbs. This was accompanied by a moderate fever, marked nervous tension, head thrust forward, fore-legs lifted abnormally high when made to walk and slight twitching of the facial muscles. The colt had fully recovered after an illness of 12 days duration. Alteration in gait and thrusting forward of the head were also seen in the 3 y.0. :-bred in the present out- break. The nervous signs exhibited by the 2 mares which died were quite different and have not been previously described in LI in the horse. Whether the death of the $-bred mare after a brief illness of 1-2 days, was brought about by the intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate a short time beforehand or not, is conjectural. Certainly the fulminating character of the disease and the severity of the nervous signs which were observed, suggest that death would have supervened in a relatively short period of time irrespective of any medication. The variation in clinical response observed in this outbreak of LI infection is no different to that described for other equine arboviral diseases affecting the CNS e.g. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (Kissling, et at., 1956), Western equine encephalomyelitis (Sponseller, et al., 1966) and West Nile encephalomyelitis (Joubert, et al., 1970). The lesions observed on histopathological examination of the brains of the i-bred mare and the draft mare were typical of viral encephalomyelitis. The difference in the severity of the lesions in the 2 horses was no greater than that seen in many field cases of LI in sheep. The lack of polymorphonuclear reaction differentiated this encephalitis from Eastern equine encephalomyelitis as described by Hurst (1934). Distribution of lesions in Borna disease in which the spinal cord is not involved, and in which the oculomotor nuclei rather than the red nuclei of the midbrain are affected (Innes and Saunders, 1962), is quite different. I I6 The results of the virological investigations confirm the importance of checking several areas of the brain when attempting virus isolation. The recovery of LI virus only from the pons, medulla, and cervical cord can be compared with the finding of Doherty and Reid (1971), that in sheep experimentally infected with LI virus by the subcutaneous route, the highest concentra- tions of virus are to be found in the brain stem and spinal cord. The ability of virus to survive in brain tissue even in the presence of high levels of homologous serum antibody, has been noted previously. In acute cases of experimental LI infection in sheep, Reid, Doherty and Dawson (1971) have reported high levels of specific IgM and IgG in cerebrospinal fluid and have in every case isolated the virus from nervous tissue. The properties of 74/E/61 virus isolated from the brain of the draft mare, were indistinguishable from those of a reference strain of LI virus. Failure to ,demonstrate a haemagglutinin in a number of crude mouse brain antigens confirms the observation of Timoney (1971), that less than one third of such antigens prepared from field isolates of LI virus have HA activity. Purification of infective mouse brain by sucrose-acetone or acetone-ether extraction procedures had to be resorted to before a HA antigen was obtained. Even though no antigenic difference could be detected between equine and reference strains of virus, it is possible that 74/E/6I virus possessed biological properties enhancing its virulence for the horse. This possibility is presently being investigated. A significant rise in antibody titre to LI virus was detected by neutralisation test in the case of the $-bred mare, and by HI and GD tests in the case of the hunter. The advisability of carrying out more than one serological assay method is evident. This outbreak of LI infection when considered in conjunction with an antibody prevalence rate of 10.6 per cent in non-Thoroughbred horses in Ireland (Timoney, I974), would indicate that further studies are required to determine the importance of L1 virus in the aetiology of equine neurological disorders and to evaluate the epidemiological importance of the horse in the natural history of this virus. SUMMARY An outbreak of LI infection in a group of free range horses is described. Three of 4 horses displayed signs of CNS disturbance and 2 of these died after illnesses ranging from 2-12 days duration. In both cases a variable degree of viral polioencephalomyelitis was observed. A virus antigenically indistinguishable from a reference strain of L1 virus was isolated from the brain and cervical cord of a 3 y.0. draft mare. Serum samples obtained from 3 of the horses contained HI, CF, pre- cipitating and neutralising antibodies to LI virus, with a rise in antibody titre being demonstrated in 2 animals.

Magnetic tape recording in preference to radio-telemetry HALL, M. C.. FENELON, A. R., MCDONALD, R. D. and STEEL, J. D. (1975). The authors describe their search for a method to reliably record cardiac responses to exercise based on electrocardiographic techniques. Initially the question of electrode placement and design led to the development of silver electrodes suspended in perspex annuli attached to the forehead and loins using a proprietary adhesive. Several systems for recording cardiac electrical activity were tested. A heart rate meter proved inadequate through poor definition of QRS complexes and doubling whenever the T wave was large. Traditional radio-telemetry using standard equipment was unreliable owing to unexpected artifacts such as shadowing of the transmitter by the rider and interference from the rider’s walkie-talkie recording system. The system finally adopted employed a stereo cassette tape recorder tied to the rider’s back in which a dual channel pulse with modulation technique was used, thus enabling effective filtering of mechanical vibration artifacts upon demodulation of the signal. Relevant circuit diagrams are given and the experimental procedure described. Aust. vet. J . 51 (12), 547-553. M. W.

J . B. DIXON WOOLCOCK, J. B. (1975). This paper describes investigation of the immunity produced in horses to challenge by Streptococcus rqui and a commercial Str. equi vaccine commonly used in Australia. Immunity was assayed by an in vitro bactericidal test, using the production of bactericidal (opsonic) antibodies against cell wall (M) antigens and a test which measured the ability of the test serum to elicit a long chain formation response. These tests are used in correlation to measure immunity to type A Streptococcal infection in man and expert opinion suggests that the tests are applicable to Str. equi and are highly type specific. Opinion also suggests that there is a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunity using these two tests. Results confirmed the recommendation of the vaccine producers that the three dose primary vaccination regime was necessary to give good initial protection in all horses vaccinated. Occasionally however, for reasons not discussed, individual horses did not respond satisfactorily to vaccination. The duration of immunity following vaccination also was variable and some horses had low titres by 3 months post vaccination. The author recommends a booster vaccination at 12 months and found a good anamnestic response at that time. Some horses with high pre-vaccinia1 titres showed intense pain and stiffness following vaccination. Natural infection produced antibody titres which had fallen to low levels by 9 weeks in most horses. This suggested that natural immunity was short lived and reinfection can occur at intervals as short as 6 months. However, even with low titres, further challenge produced a good anamnestic response and this may account for the protection often seen in the field in older horses. Natural immunity relies upon repeated challenge either by natural or artificial challenge. Without this, horses of any age are susceptible to infection. The carrier state, when it occurs, may serve as a natural method of specific immunisation. Results from horses with respiratory infection caused by atypical Str. equi suggested that immunity was highly type specific. It would be interesting to know the effect of vaccination in clinical situations of atypical Str. equi infection. In the rzviewers experience, “typical” clinical cases are frequently assorted with “atypical” bacteriological findings and vice versa. One imagines that vaccination under these circumstances would not always give the desired clinical protection. .4us. Vet. J . 51, 554-559.

DOWNS The Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, British West Indies IlhÃ©usencephalitis virus was originally isolated from the vicinity of IlhÃ©us (Bahia), Brazil by Laemmert and Hughes (1947). The agent was recovered on one occasion from a pool of Aedesâ€”Psorophora mosquitoes of which the pre@. dominant species were Aedes serratus and Psorophora ferox. Successful trans mission was effected in the laboratory to baby mice through the bites of Aedes aegypti, Aedes serratus and Psorophora ferox. Neutralizing antibodies to IthÃ©us virus were also demonstrated in the sera of two rhesus monkeys, one laboratory worker and several residents of the IlhÃ©usarea. Until the present report, IlhÃ©us virus had never been reisolated in nature and all work with the agent had stemmed from the original Brazilian strain. Recent immunity surveys in Trinidad, B.W.I., have revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IlhÃ©usvirus in a high percentage of the sera collected from certain regions of the island (Downs, Anderson and Theiler, 1956). Ac cordingly, a study was undertaken of the epidemiological aspects of IlhÃ©usvirus infection in man, and intensive efforts were made to isolate the virus from human beings and mosquitoes. The details of the isolation of two virus strains from mosquitoes and the identification of them as strains of IlhÃ©usvirus are reported below. ISOLATION The first strain (TRVL Specimen No. 5800) was isolated from a collection of 75 mosquitoes representing eight genera (see Table 1). The mosquitoes were captured in the Melajo Forest about seven and a half miles north of Sangre Grande, Trinidad, B.W.I., on September 13, 1954. The pool of mosquitoes was ground in a mortar and suspended in 9 ml. of bovalbumin diluent.2 The suspen sion was centrifuged in a 4Â°C.cold room for 30 minutes at about 10,000 RPM in an angle-head centrifuge. The supernatant fluid was removed and 0.03 ml. of it was inoculated, intracerebrally, into each of six 3â€”4-week-oldSwiss mice. A portion was also stored in the dry ice box in a sealed glass ampoule. After an incubation period of from five to six days, five of the mice showed definite signs of illness. Three of the mice were sacrificed and suspensions prepared from their brains were passaged into groups of adult mice. An agent of high virulence for â€˜Thestudies and observations which this paper is based upon were conducted with the support and under the auspices of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme and The Rockefeller Foundation. 2 The diluent is composed of: 0.12 molar sodium chloride; 0.006 molar monobasic sodium phosphate; 0.012 dibasic sodium phosphate; and 0.75% fraction 5 bovalbuinin. The pH is adjusted to between 6.8 and 7.3 by the addition of 0.3 molar sodium hydroxide solution. The diluent is sterilized by filtration through a Seitz EK pad. 621 Skal,, 5800 (Melajo Forest)Sfrain 6851 (CharumaForest)Mosquito speciesNumbersMosquitospeciesNumbersPsorophora ferox albipes Aedes serratus scapularis hortator 22 6 18 10 2Psorophora ferox albipes cingulata Total 89 2 52 143fulvus Culex spissipes sp Mansonia venezuelensis...1 2 2 1Anopheles homunculus....

The agent passed readily through a bacteria-tight Seitz EK pad. The virus rapidly became adapted to mice and no significant change in the 4-day incubation period was noted from the second to the sixty-eighth passage. The virus was capable of producing death of adult mice following the intraperitoneal inoculation of large doses. The virus was successfully reisolated from the sample of the original mosquito suspension stored in the dry ice box. The second strain (TRVL Specimen No. 6851) was isolated from a collection of 143 mosquitoes representing three species of Psorophora (Table 1). The mos quitoes were captured at the end of the Charuina Road in the Charuma Forest, Tabaquite, Trinidad, B.W.I., on October 12, 1954. The Charuma Road site where these mosquitoes were caught is about 22 miles (crow flight) from the Melajo Forest collection site, almost in the geographical center of the island. The mosquito suspension was prepared in the same manner as the one described above, except that the total volume of bovalbumin diluent employed was 12 ml. A group of six young adult mice was inoculated intracerebrally and a sample was stored in the dry ice box. Three of the inoculated mice showed obvious signs of illness on the eighth post-inoculation day. Inoculation of normal mice intra cerebrally with brain suspensions prepared from the brains of two of the sick mice reproduced the disease, and the agent was easily maintained in passage by this technique. The agent passed readily through a bacteria-tight Seitz EK pad. This agent did not adapt as readily to mice as did the first strain. The incubation period for the first few passages was six to seven days, and often one or two of the mice survived the inoculation of a ten per cent brain suspen ISOLATION OF ILH@IJS VIRUS 623 sion. The incubation period gradually decreased to four days on continued passage and the virus became more uniformly lethal for the mice. The 6851 strain likewise produced a fatal infection in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a large amount of virus. Reisolation of this agent from the original mos quito suspension has not been attempted. IDENTIFICATION The recent immunity survey in Trinidad revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to a number of viral agents in the sera of various residents of the island (Downs et at., 1956). Accordingly, specific antisera against these agents were sent from The Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratories in New York to aid in the identification of viruses isolated in Trinidad. Immune sera to the following viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize strains 5800 and 6851: Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis; St. Louis; IlhÃ©us; yellow fever; Bunyamwera; Mengo; and Semliki Forest. In these tests over 100 MLD50 of each virus was present. The results suggested that the two strains might be strains of IlhÃ©usvirus. In the case of the 6851 virus, IlhÃ©usimmune serum protected all of the mice, whereas none of the other sera in the test af forded any protection. The test with the 5800 virus was not so clear-cut, but the delay in incubation period and time of death of the mice receiving virus plus IlhÃ©usimmune serum was suggestive of protective effect. Working from this lead, rabbits, which were found to be susceptible to flhÃ©us virus by Koprowski and Hughes (1946), were inoculated intraperitoneally with infected mouse brain suspensions of the original Brazilian IlhÃ©usstrain and the 5800 and 6851 strains in order to produce specific antisera to each. Sufficient preinoculation serum was collected from each rabbit to serve as a control in the tests employing the corresponding immune serum. The rabbits were exsan guinated between one and two months after inoculation. All sera were stored in sterile lusteroid tubes at â€”20Â°C. The neutralizing capacity of each antiserum for each of the viruses was studied. In these tests tenfold dilutions of virus were mixed with an equal volume of undilutedrabbitimmune serum. A controltitration,employing the pre-im munization serum from the same rabbit, was made simultaneously. The sera were not inactivated. The serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37Â°C.for an hour, after which they were kept in an ice bath during the time of inoculation. The serum-virus mixtures were inoculated intracerebrally into groups of six young adult mice. Titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938). The neutralizing capacity was calculated as the difference between the titer of the virus in the pre-immunization sera and the post-immunization sera, and is recorded as the logarithm of the number of 50 per cent end point doses (MLD 50's) neutralized. Results of these tests are summarized in Table 2. The data show that each of the antisera neutralized significant amounts of each virus, and, taken as a whole, indicate that the agents were sufficiently similar to be considered as strains of the same virus.

When tested for their ability to agglutinate baby chick red blood cells, all three strains showed optimum reactions at pH 6.8 and 4Â°C.The Brazilian IlhÃ©usand 6851 strains agglutinated beyond an antigen dilution of 1:3,200, while two different batches of strain 5800 had end points at 1:200 and 1:800 respectively. While such variations may be caused by in herent differences in strains, it is also possible that the time of harvesting the mouse brains may play a considerable part in determining the potency of anti gen, and timing of the harvesting is difficult to standardize. SUMMARY Two strains of virus, isolated in 1954 from forest mosquitoes in Trinidad, B.W.I., have been shown by reciprocal cross-neutralization tests to be strains of IlhÃ©usvirus. Both strains produce a hemagglutinating antigen, similar in reactivity to the antigen produced from the known IlhÃ©usstrain. These isola tions represent the second and third times the virus has been found in nature. ADDENDUM Since submitting this paper for publication, four more IlliÃ©usvirus isolations from Trinidad mosquitoes have been made by the laboratory. All isolations were made in two-day-old mice inoculated with mosquitoes caught in the Rio Grande Forest about eight miles northeast of Sangre Grande. Strain one (TRVL speci men No. 10507) came from a mixed pool of 105 mosquitoes (21 species in nine genera) collected 16/XII/55; strain two (TRVL specimen No. 10554) came from a mixed pool of 233 mosquitoes (17 species in eight genera) collected 23/XII/55; strain three (TRVL specimen No. 10584) came from a mixed pooi of 103 mos quitoes (13 species in seven genera) collected 3/1/56; and the fourth strain (TRVL specimen No. 10654) was isolated from a pool of seven Psorophoraferox collected 10/1/56. All of the mixed pools contained reasonably large numbers of Aedes and Psorophora species except No. 10584 which had 30 Aedes (serratws) and only one Psorophora (lutzi).

Ubico and Robert G. McLean Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services, Fort Collins, Colorado 80522, USA ABSTRACT: Neotropical bats were collected from different life zones in Guatemala in 1983 and 1984 to determine the presence and distribution of antibody against 10 viruses. Bats were collected with mist nets at 13 sites in eight departments and 332 serum specimens were obtained for testing for neutralizing (N) antibody by the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Eighty-seven (26%) of the 332 bats from 16 (38%) of 42 bat species sampled were serologically positive for five of six arboviruses and for two other viruses tested. Antibodies against Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) variant I-A/B, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, St. Louis enceph- alitis, vesicular stomatitis, Tacaribe, and Rio Bravo viruses were detected in resident species of bats. However, N antibodies against the enzootic strain of VEE (Mena II, variant I-E) or Nepuyo viruses were not detected. Key words: Bats, arboviruses, viruses, Guatemala, neotropical bats, serologic survey. INTRODUCTION Members of the order Chiroptera have a wide distribution, perhaps the most ex- tensive range among mammals except for Rodentia. The tropical climate of Central America supports a variety of species. As many as 100 species of bats eventually may be found in Guatemala (Jones, 1966). Microbial pathogens that are found in bats or bat guano from roosts include bac- teria, fungi, and viruses. Bats also harbor an array of ectoparasites and endoparasites that may cause disease or be vectors of one or more disease agents (Hill and Smith, 1984). Bats are infected by at least 28 different viruses, and antibodies against another 32 viruses have been discovered (Hill and Smith, 1984; Karabatsos, 1985). Many of the viruses often are not pathogenic to bats; many also are not pathogenic or are only mildly pathogenic to humans (Hill and Smith, 1984). Sulkin (1962) and Donalson (1970) have implicated bats as possible carriers of ve- sicular stomatitis (VS) viruses over long distances; Tesh et a!. (1969) reported that among wild animals, bats had the highest prevalence of antibody against VS-New Jersey (VSNJ) virus. Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses have been iso- lated from neotropical bats in Venezuela (Kubes and Rios, 1939), Ecuador (Gutier- rez, 1972), Colombia (Jonkers, 1972), and Mexico (Correa-Giron et al., 1971; Scherer et al., 1971). Antibodies against VEE have been found in bats from Texas (USA) (Su- dia et al., 1975), Mexico, and Guatemala (Sudia et al., 1971; Seymour et al., 1973). Seymour et al. (1973) proposed that bats may serve as alternate hosts to maintain virus transmission in the enzootic cycle. Other viruses such as St. Louis enceph- alitis (SLE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), and yellow fever (YF) could be important to the public and veterinary health in Central America, but their fre- quency and distribution are not well known (Acha and Szyfres, 1987). The role of bats in the transmission cycles and ecology of these viruses is not known. The apparent insignificance of the contribution of bats to the maintenance of SLE virus may be a result of lack of scrutiny rather than lack of importance (McLean and Bowen, 1980). Other viruses isolated from mammals in Guatemala include Nepuyo (NEP) (Scher- er et al., 1976), Patois (Scherer et al., 1985), and Jutiapa (Karabatsos, 1985). Tacaribe (TCR) virus also has been isolated and an- tibody against this virus found in bats This One I��IIIII�IIIIU110III�III�IIUIIIIIII�l11111I�l TFHH-A68-KK8K .,� � Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use MEXICO BBEAN SEA 1 � 2 1 � 4. �1 I 2 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 31.

(Price, 1978). However, the public health importance of these viruses has not been established (Scherer et a!., 1985; Calisher et al., 1971). Except for rabies, most viruses found in bats occur only in specific and frequently very localized regions of the world. The importance of bats in the ecology of Guatemala and the lack of information on their possible role as reservoir hosts of viral diseases prompted this investigation. Our objective was to determine the sero- logic prevalence and distribution of 10 vi- ruses in bats from Guatemala. MATERIALS AND METHODS Guatemala is the most western and northern of the Central American countries, situated be- tween a latitude of 13#{176}46’and 17#{176}58’Nand a longitude of 88#{176}13’and 92#{176}12’W, with an area of 108,900 km2. It is on the transitional limits of both the nearctic and neotropical regions and has a great variety of ecosystems (Land, 1970; Holdridge et al., 1971). Bats were collected from 13 sites in eight de- partments in Guatemala (Fig. 1). Equipment and procedures used to capture and handle bats were similar to those described by Sudia et al. (1970). Mist nets were placed at ground level in open and sheltered sites within habitats selected to sample a variety of bat species. Net placement was the same during each sampling period, and nets were operated for one to three nights at a site from dusk to dawn. Nets were checked be- tween 0500 and 0600 hr. Ectoparasites were removed from all captured bats and preserved in 70% ethanol. Bats were bled from the heart with a 1-ml syringe and 25 to 27 gauge needle after immobilization with ethyl ether. Blood (0.1 to 0.2 ml) from each bat was mixed with 0.9 ml of field diluent, consisting of M199 nutrient me- dium (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) with antibiotics and 20% heat-inactivated (56 C for 30 mm) fetal bovine serum (McLean et al., 1985a). Blood specimens were kept on wet ice and allowed to clot. Specimens were centrifuged at 900 x C for 15 mm; the serum was stored in screw-capped, labeled vials and held at -70 C for shipment to the Centers for Disease Control laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado (USA), for testing. Taxonomic study skins and skulls of these bats were prepared in the field and later deposited in the mammal collection of the U.S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution in Washing- ton, D.C. for final identification (Hall, 1981). Heat-inactivated (56 C for 30 mm) serum specimens were tested for antibody against VEE (TC-83 strain, variant I-A/B and Mena II strain, variant I-E), SLE (MSI-7 strain), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE, NJ-160 strain), WEE (Flem- ing MI-2959B strain), VS-Indiana (VSI, labo- ratory strain), VSNJ (Greentree strain), TCR (11573 strain), NEP (P55MI strain) and Rio Bra- vo (RB, M64 strain) viruses by the plaque-re- duction neutralization test (McLean et al., 1985b). Serum samples were mixed with equal volumes of each of the challenge viruses diluted to contain approximately 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) per 0.1 ml. After overnight incu- bation at 4 C, 0.1 ml of the mixture was added to monolayers of Vero cell cultures (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, USA) grown in six-well plastic plates. After 1 hr of absorption at 37 C, inoculated cultures were overlaid with nutrient medium containing 1% Noble agar (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, Michigan, USA) and 1:25,000 neutral red (Gib- co). Cultures were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 3 to 7 days or until plaques could be counted. Reduction of plaque counts by 80% or more as compared with controls was considered positive.

UBICO AND McLEAN-VIRUS SURVEY OF GUATEMALAN BATS 3 TABLE 1. Neutralizing antibody’ against selected viruses found in different species of bats, Guatemala, 1983-84. RESULTS Five hundred bats were captured using mist nests at 13 study sites in Guatemala, but only 332 blood samples were obtained. Eighty-seven (26%) of the 332 individual bats from 16 (38%) of 42 bat species col- lected at 11 of the 13 sites had antibodies against one or more of the different viruses tested (Tables 1, 2, 3). Twenty-two (6.6%) of the 332 bats ex- amined for VEE virus, TC-83 strain, were neutralizing (N)-antibody positive (Table 1); however, no antibody-positive bats were detected for the enzootic strain of VEE virus, Mena II. Six bat species were sero- positive for VEE virus TC-83 strain, and the species with the highest prevalence was Artibeus jarnaicensis, with 16 bats positive (Table 1); 14 of these bats were collected in Finca Santillana del Mar, Masagua, Es- cuintla and the other two came from Jesus Maria, Zacapa sites (Table 2). Nine (2.7%) of 328 bats examined for the VSI virus strain were positive. All were species of the genus Artibeus. For the VSNJ virus strain, 16 (4.8%) of 332 bats exam- ined were positive; A. jamaicensis had the highest antibody prevalence for this virus (Table 1). The area with the highest prev- alence was El Peten with 6.7% of the bats positive for VSI virus (Table 2). Fourteen (4.5%) of 308 bats tested for antibody to SLE virus were positive (Table 1). These bats were collected in Tikal and Finca Raxija (Table 2). The genus Artibeus had the highest prevalence (Table 1), and all SLE N-antibody positive bats were fruit feeders. Six species of bats were seropositive for EEE virus (Table 1). The Department of Escuintla had the highest prevalence and the study site with the next highest prev- alence was Tikal, with six positive bats (Ta- ble 2).

Percent positive. WEE virus was an A. lituratus collected in Tika!. Antibody against TCR virus was only detected from one A. lituratus from Tikal, El Peten. No N-antibody positive results were obtained for NEP virus. Fifty (19%) of 271 bats examined for RB virus were N-antibody positive (Table 3); the highest prevalence (50%) was in the genus Artibeus. Most of the RB-antibody positive bats were captured in Tikal (Table 3). DISCUSSION To avoid unnecessary stress, some bats such as pregnant and lactating females, weak bats, very young bats, as well as in- dividuals from some species for which ad- equate samples had already been collect- ed, were released without being bled. Thus blood samples were taken only from 332 of the 500 captured bats. Most bats that were N-antibody positive for VEE virus were collected in the De- partment of Escuintla (Fig. 1), near La Avellana, a VEE virus-enzootic area (Sey- mour et a!., 1973). Only three seropositive bats were detected in El Progreso and Za- capa (Fig. 1), a disease-epidemic area in the 1969 VEE outbreak (Sudia et al., 1971). Tikal, where repeated human infections have occurred since 1966 (Scherer et al., 1970), only had three sero-positive bats. These findings, together with the work of Correa-Giron et al. (1971) and Seymour et a!. (1973), are evidence that an enzootic VEE cycle exists. It was surprising that only serologic reactions to TC-83 strain, and not to the enzootic strain Mena II, were detected, even though the enzootic strain exists in Guatemala (Sudia et a!., 1971). The enzootic strain may be more prevalent in the coastal habitats which were not sampled during this investigation.

No neutralizing antibodies against Rio Bravo virus was found among any bats tested at the Fincas Caldera and Union study site in the Department of El Peten, at the Auto Safari Chapin study site of the Department of Escuintla, at the Finca Rio Frio study site of the Department of Izabal, at the Finca El Eden study site of the Department of San Marcos, or at the Jesus Maria and Montes de Moran study sites of the Department of Zacapa. explanation for the presence of antibody against the epizootic variant I-A/B virus may be that the vaccine virus that was derived from an epizootic variant I-A/B virus has been circulating in natural cycles within Guatemala as was discovered pre- viously in Louisiana (USA) (Pedersen et al., 1972). Epizootics due to EEE virus are rare in Central and South America, although epi- zootics in North America are frequent. These differences may be attributed to the habits of the respective vectors. It has been suggested that EEE virus has a sylvatic cycle in the subtropical and tropical regions of the American continent (Galindo et al., 1966). McLean et a!. (1985a) believe that mammals may be important hosts for EEE virus. Based on serologic results, bats roost- ing in places commonly used by mosqui- toes can serve as natural hosts for EEE and other viruses (Main, 1979). We found 24 (7.2%) of the 332 bats with EEE N-anti- body; 12 of these bats were collected in Escuintla (Table 2, Fig. 1) at the same site where another cluster of bats also was found to be VEE virus antibody positive. Bats with EEE antibody also were found in El Peten (Fig. 1), an area where the virus had been isolated previously from humans (Scherer et al., 1976). According to Or- donez et al. (1971), the only mammals found positive for EEE virus were sentinel hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Our re- port is the first of an enzootic activity of EEE virus during non-epizootic periods in Guatemala. However, little is known about the natural history of EEE virus in this country. Western equine encephalitis occurs in the same geographic areas as SLE and may even share the same vector species (Mo- nath, 1980). Mixed SLE-WEE epizootics are the rule in the western United States, but generally one or the other virus pre- dominates (Monath, 1980). Western equine encephalitis virus has been isolated from bats (Constantine, 1970). Western equine encephalitis N-antibody also was detected in A. jarnaicensis from Haiti (McLean et a!., 1979). One A. lituratus bat from Tikal was found positive for WEE N-antibody. Thus, it appears that bats occasionally may become infected with WEE, especially during epizootics of the disease in other hosts. No previous WEE activity has been reported in Guatemala. Bats in Tikal also had antibodies to SLE virus, which would Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use 6 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 31, NO. 1, JANUARY 1995 confirm the presence of the two viruses sharing the same ecosystem, and be evi- dence that enzootic activity of both viruses is possible in the dry tropical forest of El Peten. Serologic surveys of humans in the neighboring countries of Belize, El Sal- vador, and Mexico have provided evi- dence for SLE virus activity in those coun- tries (Bertram, 1971; Spence, 1980). We found evidence of antibody to SLE virus in bats from El Peten and Baja Verapaz (Table 2, Fig. 1) which is a range extension of this virus. The mode of VS virus transmission in this region is not understood, although in some situations the virus could be trans- mitted by direct contact among animals (Webb and Holbrook, 1989). High anti- body rates to VSI virus in bats have been observed in leishmaniasis-endemic areas (Srihongse, 1969). Shelokov and Peralta (1967) suggested that sand flies could be a common vector. Also, we found a high prevalence of antibody to VS viruses, spe- cifically to VSI virus in El Peten (Table 2, Fig. 1); this site also is endemic for cuta- neous leishmaniasis (Navin et al., 1988). The other regions where leishmaniasis has been reported in Guatemala are El Pro- greso and Zacapa (Fig. 1); both of these areas also had bats positive for antibody against VSNJ virus (Table 2). However, VS-antibody positive bats were captured in Escuint!a, which is not within the leish- maniasis-endemic regions. Bats could be maintenance hosts and even possible carriers of VS viruses over long distances (Donalson, 1970; Tesh et al., 1970). We found antibodies to VSI virus in three species of frugivorous Artibeus, while antibodies to VSNJ virus were found in both hematophagous and nonhema- tophagous bats (Table 1). Based on our results, we further propose that bats may be maintenance hosts of VS viruses, and that vampire bats may be transmitters of the viruses. Other viruses in the TCR group are known to produce infections in rodents and sometimes severe and often fatal hemor- rhagic fevers in humans (Shelokov, 1964; Calisher et al., 1970). But, Price (1978) believes that there is no current evidence of TCR virus infection in humans. Taca- ribe virus has been isolated from A. litura- tus palmarum and A. jamaicensis trinita- tis (Downs et a!., 1963). Antibodies to TCR virus also have been found in 25 species of bats in Trinidad (Price, 1978). The an- tibody-positive bat found in this study was an A. lit uratus collected in the dry tropical forest of Tikal (Table 1, Fig. 1). Even though TCR virus does not have any pub- lic health importance, it should be differ- entiated from rabies in bats that have bit- ten humans (Constantine, 1970). We were unable to detect N antibody against NEP virus in any of the bats col- lected in Guatemala, probably because none of the study sites were in coastal marshes or near marshy areas. Nepuyo vi- rus may be widely distributed on marshy coastal areas (Scherer et a!., 1985); how- ever, the incidence is completely un- known. Our findings confirm the presence of RB virus in the bats of Guatemala (Table 3). Most past virus isolates had been obtained from salivary glands and a few were from brown fat (Constantine and Woodall, 1964; Baer and Woodall, 1966). Tadarida brasi- liensis is believed to be the natural host for RB virus (Constantine, 1970). This bat is distributed from the southern United States into Argentina (Nowak and Para- diso, 1983); therefore, the virus probably is widely distributed too. Based on our findings, antibody to the virus is present in different species of neotropical bats (Ta- ble 3), including Eptesicus fuscus, a spe- cies in which the virus was previously found (Constantine, 1970; Karabatsos, 1985). All the bats reported here as positive for antibody to RB virus are known to roost in caves just as T. brasiliensis and E. fuscus do. Since RB virus is believed to be trans- mitted via aerosol, cave roosting increases Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 09 Apr 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use UBICO AND McLEAN-VIRUS SURVEY OF GUATEMALAN BATS 7 the probability for transmission of this vi- rus among neotropical bats.

CALISHER Vector-Borne Diseases Division, Bureau of Laboratories, Centers for Disease Control, Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Post Office Box 2087, Fort Collins, Colorado 80522 Abstract. In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, fÃ¨ces,etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity ti- trations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary PÃ©kinduck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutrali zation tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey menin- goencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five anti genic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, TamaÃ±abat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro. Although 44 of the registered flaviviruses have been isolated principally or exclusively from mos quitoes or ticks, the remaining 17 have never been recovered from wild-caught arthropods.1 These 17 flaviviruses, isolated primarily from bats and ro dents, may be true arboviruses, transmitted in as yet undefined vectors. Alternatively, they may have maintained a primitive mode of direct trans fer using saliva,2""4 aerosols,5 milk,6 urine7""9 or transplacental transmission. These flaviviruses may represent 1) descendents of ancestral viruses which have not adapted to replication in inver tebrates or 2) viruses which have evolved to an existence now independent of a vector interme diate.4- 10 The flaviviruses under consideration are dis- Accepted 5 March 1982. * This investigation was supported by National Sci ence Foundation grant SPI 78-19169.

Nearly half of the agents have been isolated from the salivary glands of bats. These include Aroa (N. Karabatsos, personal communication, 1980), Batu Cave,1 Carey Island,1 Dakar bat,14 Entebbe bat,15 Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis (MML),16 Phnom Penh bat,17 Rio Bravo,1 Soku luk,18 and TamaÃ±abat3 viruses. Previous studies comparing limited numbers of these viruses1 have described virulence in a vari ety of hosts and demonstrated antigenic related- ness by hemagglutination-inhibition, comple ment-fixation (CF), or neutralization (N) tests. We present the results of virulence studies and sero logie determinations designed to examine the rec ognized flaviviruses with no known vector asso ciations. In addition to the registered prototypes, we also included in this comparison Bukalasa bat18 1273 1274 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER virus, which has yet to be registered, a recently isolated flavivirus from a Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse), and two flaviviruses from Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat) captured in two areas of south Texas. A number of strains of St. Louis encephalitis virusâ€”a proven arbovirusâ€” were also included as controls. An attempt was made to correlate antigenic relationships with geo graphic distribution and potential for arthropod transmission. In this paper, we shall use the term ""flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status"" (FUAS) when referring to those viruses already described. We recognize that some FUAS, e.g., Koutango and Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, may eventually be shown to be transmitted by arthropod vectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Viruses and virus titrations Known histories of the viruses used in these studies are presented in Table 1. Stock virus was prepared as clarified 10% or 20% suspensions of suckling mouse (SM) brain in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.3) containing 4% bovine albumin. Virus seeds were titrated in 2- to 4-day-old SM and endpoints calculated by the method of Reed and Muench.19 Plaque formation was determined in primary PÃ©kinduck embryo (DE) and contin uous rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK,) or Afri can green monkey kidney (Vero) cells; titers were recorded as plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of inoculum. For production of immune ascitic fluids, adult mice were given four immunizing doses in com plete Freund's adjuvant, as described by Tika- singh et al.2"" Inoculation of mosquito cell cultures In order to provisionally assess the potential of these FUAS for replication in mosquitoes, an in vitro system was used. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells21were inoculated with an approximate 1,000 PFU of each of 20 FUAS. St. Louis encephalitis virus, strain TBH-28, a known mosquito-borne virus, and Colorado tick fever virus, strain Florio, a known tick-borne virus, were included as ""pos itive"" and ""negative"" controls, respectively. C6/36 cells were collected in their own supernatant fluids when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed or on day 10, when uninoculated control C6/36 cell cultures began to spontaneously degenerate. Har vests were then titrated in LLC-MK> or Vero cells, whichever cell line had given the highest titers in previous tests. Complement-fixation, hemagglutination, and neutralization tests Antigens for complement-fixation (CF) and hemagglutination (HA) tests were prepared from infected SM brains by sucrose-acetone extrac tion.22 Infectious and beta propiolactone inacti vated antigens were used in a microtiter adapta tion of the LBCF5n test;23 antigens prepared by these methods possess similar breadths of reactiv ity. Serum dilution plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed as previously described.24 Virus-serum mixtures were incubated for approx imately 18 hours at 4Â°Cbefore inoculation of cell monolayers. All except SLE virus-infected cul tures received double agar overlays, with 1:25,000 neutral red in the second overlay. RESULTS Biologic properties Titers of FUAS in mice and cell cultures are shown in Table 2. Titers in SM were from 168'9 to IO1""-1icLD5l(/ml.Average survival times ranged from 4-10 days. Aroa, Entebbe bat, Israel turkey meningoen cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya, and Sokuluk vi ruses produced distinct plaques in Vero cells; Apoi, Batu Cave, Bukalasa bat, Carey Island, Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Montana Myotis leucoencephali- tis, Negishi, Phnom Penh bat, Rio Bravo, and TamaÃ±abat viruses produced indistinct plaques, and the remainder failed to plaque in these cells. All but Entebbe bat and Saboya viruses produced distinct plaques in LLC-MK2 cells; titers ranged from IO44to 10""M PFU/ml. Israel turkey menin goencephalitis and Koutango viruses produced clear plaques in primary DE cells. Aroa, Dakar bat, Entebbe bat, Modoc, Montana Myotis leu- coencephalitis, Negishi, Rio Bravo, and Saboya viruses formed indistinct plaques, and the rest failed to plaque in these cells. Twelve strains of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN FLAVIVIRUSES. virus were selected from a variety of SLE virus isolates of mammalian and mosquito origin and from various locations and collection dates. These were tested in order to select what might be con sidered representative biological variants, based upon unusually low or high titers in SM or DE cells or unusual plaque morphology or delayed ap pearance of plaques in DE cells. Since some of these strains were from rodents it was thought not unlikely that one or more of these strains might have characteristics more similar to FUAS than to prototype SLE virus. However, titers in SM ranged from IO7-2to IO10""3icLD5(l/mland average survival times from 4-7 days. All 12isolates formed plaques in DE cells with titers from IO6-""to IO9-2 PFU/ml; plaques were of uniform morphology and apparent by the 3rd day after inoculation. There fore, only four (Table 1) of the 12 strains were used in further comparisons. Replication in mosquito cell cultures As summarized in Table 3, C6/36 cells showed CPE 9 days after inoculation with SLE virus, a known mosquito-borne flavivirus, and with Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango and Sa boya viruses, 5, 9, and 9 days after inoculation, respectively. Since virus replication could occur without CPE, C6/36 cell harvests were titrated in a sensitive indicator cell culture (LLC-MK, or Vero cells) by plaque assay. All four viruses which caused CPE in C6/36 cells titered IO5Â°PFU/ml or greater. In addition, Aroa, Entebbe bat and Sok uluk viruses replicated to low levels (IO2-7'3-0PFU/ ml) in the mosquito cell line. Hemagglutinin activity Antigens for all but two viruses (Carey Island and TamaÃ±abat) were shown to possess hemag- glutinin activity. The pH optima ranged from 5.9 to 6.8; most optima were below pH 6.5. Excep tions were Aroa (pH 6.7), Koutango (pH 6.6), Sa boya (pH 6.8), and Sokuluk (pH 6.8) viruses. Hemagglutinin activity optima for two of the four SLE virus strains used in these studies had pH optima 6.6 (BeAn 246262 (pH 6.5) and CorAn 9124 (pH 6.3)). No plaques observed in LLC-MK or Vero cells after inoculation with C6/36 harvest. Complement fixation tests Table 4 summarizes the results of cross CF tests. Nearest antigenic neighbors are presented contig uously. When heterologous antibody titer differed more than fourfold from the homologous titer of the virus with which it was compared, it was con sidered a significant difference. Complement-fixation test results may be sum marized as follows: 1. Despite the high potency of immune fluids to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Aroa, Carey Island, and Koutango viruses, significant relationships with other FUAS were not observed. 2. Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus was reactive one-way with SLE virus strains TBH-28 and 246262. 3. Batu Cave and Phnom Penh bat viruses re acted reciprocally to high titer, and could not be distinguished from one another. 4. Antibody to Cowbone Ridge virus, although of low titer, reacted with Sokuluk, SLE strain BeAn 246262, and Sal Vieja* viruses. Jutiapa vi rus was found to be related one-way to San Perlita and MA-387-72 viruses. MA-387-72 and San Per lita* viruses were reciprocally cross-reactive to high titers. 5. Sal Vieja antiserum reacted to high titer with MA-387-72, San Perlita, and Cowbone Ridge vi ruses. 6. Antibody to Rio Bravo virus cross-reacted principally with Apoi and San Perlita antigens. 7. Antibody to Dakar bat virus reacted only with Bukalasa bat and Apoi antigens, and then at a barely detectable level. 8. Antibodies to Bukalasa bat, Montana My otis leucoencephalitis, Negishi, and TamaÃ±abat viruses reacted significantly only with homologous antigens. Negishi antigen, however, titered to within eightfold of homologous antibody to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus. * Mention here of this virus designation is not intend ed to constitute priority. Antibody to Koutango virus reacted to equal titer with homologous antigen and those of SLE strains CorAn 9124 and SPAn 8678, and antibody to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis reacted sig nificantly with the four strains of SLE virus. Neutralization tests Table S summarizes results of neutralization (N) tests with viruses which were shown to be closely related by CF. The N test results may be sum marized as follows: 1. Antibody to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Aroa, Bukalasa bat, Dakar bat, Entebbe bat, Koutango, Negishi, and Rio Bravo viruses significantly neutralized only homologous virus. Bukalasa bat virus is distinct from the other viruses tested. 2. SLE strain SPAn 8678 reacts in one direction with Aroa virus. 3. The reciprocal neutralization of Batu Cave and Phnom Penh bat viruses indicates that they are strains of the same virus rather than distinct prototypes. 4. Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Modoc, San Per lita and Sal Vieja viruses are interrelated but an- tigenically distinct. San Perlita and strain MA- 387-72 were reciprocally cross-neutralized and ap pear to represent two isolates of a single, newly recognized virus. DISCUSSION Previous studies of various FTJAS have de scribed replication in a variety of hosts and pro posed antigenic relationships using numerous, perhaps not strictly comparable, serologie tests. The uniform comparisons reported here provide complete relationships between all the viruses tested and allow a precise definition of antigenic relationships, at least insofar as concerns the re agents used. Virulence of these viruses in SM and in LLC-MK.2, Vero and C6/36 cell lines, and in DE cells was determined. Infactivity titers in SM were generally higher than in cell cultures. Pro longed survival of laboratory mice infected with many of these viruses may reflect long-standing adaptations to mammalian hosts. Most of the FUAS produced distinct plaques in LLC-MK2 cells, with the exception of Entebbe bat (in con trast to earlier reports25) and Saboya viruses. Our finding that LLC-MK, cells, in general, are su perior for the replication of these agents confirms previous observations.25'26 Davis and Hardy were able to plaque Modoc virus in Vero cells,27where as we were not; this observation may reflect a difference between their cells and ours. Israel turkey meningoencephalitis and Koutan- go viruses, as well as 12 strains of SLE virus, formed discrete plaques in DE cells. This may be indicative of adaptation to avian hosts.28 Most of the FUAS failed to produce plaques in DE cells, possibly a reflection of adaptation to mammalian reservoir hosts. Epidemiologie evidence suggests that Israel tur key meningoencephalitis virus is arthropod-borne, since avian outbreaks of encephalitis caused by this virus occur seasonally, coinciding with peak arthropod activity.29 Also, it replicates in Aedes albopictus cells3""and is maintained for as long as 30 days in Ae. aegypti and Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes, although transmission rates vary. Titer given as geometric mean of two or more determinations. t Blank = not tested t â€”= <40. In addition to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus, Koutango virus replicated in C6/36 cells. Coz et al.28 have documented experimental trans mission of Koutango virus by Ae. aegypti mos quitoes infected by intrathoracic inoculation, ar tificial feeding, and feeding on viremic hosts. Koutango virus has also been shown to be trans- ovarially transmitted by Ae. aegypti.32 If any cor relation exists between replication in C6/36 cells and in mosquitoes, then Israel turkey meningoen cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya and probably Aroa, Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses are arthropod- borne. Replication, with or without CPE in C6/ 36 cells, may be an indication of the potential for replication of viruses in mosquito cells in vivo. Aroa virus was initially isolated from a sentinel hamster and therefore is probably arthropod- transmitted; it is related to Bussuquara virus in CF tests (R. E. Shope, personal communication, 1979) and is neutralized by antibody to Bussu quara strain BeAn 4073 and to SLE strain SPAn 8678 viruses; and replicates in C6/36 cells. The second large cluster of FUAS includes those isolated from rodents and bats and which may be transmitted by direct contact. Transmission stud ies with mosquitoes infected by intrathoracic in oculation, artificial feeding, or feeding on infected hosts have been unproductive for Saboya,28 Dakar bat,28 Modoc,4-6 Rio Bravo,4-'"" Apoi,1 Phnom Penh bat,17 Entebbe and Bukalasa bat33 viruses. In addition, Modoc, Apoi, and Rio Bravo viruses failed to replicate in mosquito cell lines.3 Although as yet undescribed and/or unusual arthropod cycles may exist, they have not been detected in arthro pod field studies.'-3-5-13-1(i Saboya virus, isolated from Tatera kempi (ger- bils) in Senegal, is distantly related to Dakar bat, Carey Island, Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses. Antigenic relationships have been shown between Saboya virus and certain mosquito-borne flavivi- ruses of Africa, including Banzi, Bouboui, and Uganda S viruses. ' While attempts to experimen tally infect Ae. aegypti with Saboya virus by in- trathoracic inoculation have failed,28 replication in C6/36 cells (Table 3) may be indirect evidence for replication in arthropods. Apoi virus, isolated only from rodents in Japan, fails to react appreciably with any of the other viruses. Considerable antigenic overlap occurs among the FUAS of North and Central American ro dents, in contrast to the antigenic distance be tween Koutango and Saboya viruses isolated from African rodents. Sal Vieja virus is antigenically unique both by CF and N tests. In fact, based upon CF and N data, an antigenic spectrum ap pears to exist among Cowbone Ridge, Modoc, Sal Vieja, San Perlita, and Jutiapa viruses. Cowbone Ridge has been shown to be related to Modoc virus13 which, in turn, shares antigens with San Perlita prototype (and strain MA-387-72) as well as Jutiapa viruses. Jutiapa, Cowbone Ridge, and San Perlita viruses have been isolated from Sig- modon hispidus in Guatemala, the Florida ever glades, and Texas, respectively. Modoc from the western United States and Canada and Sal Vieja from Texas have been recovered from Peromys- cus species. The antigenic relatedness of Jutiapa to Cow- bone Ridge virus may reflect their evolution in the cricetid rodent host, S. hispidus. A similar asso ciation between the South American cricetid ro dents and at least seven arenaviruses in the Ta- caribe complex relates Zoogeographie distribution of host species to viral phytogeny. Ancestral Cri- 1282 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER cetidae invaded South America from North Amer ica during the Miocene-Pliocene epoch,34 and evolved into a wide variety of forms. Simulta neously, evolution of new arenaviruses occurred. As Arata and Gratz have pointed out,35 the evo lution of S. hispidus as a South American species is certain from the Pleistocene record, and this rodent is therefore a recent invader back into North America. With this migration of S. hispidus, a member of the Tacaribe serogroup (Tamiami vi rus) may have been introduced to Florida. Anal ogous with the arenaviruses, there are bunyavi ruses and FUAS of Florida and Central and South America which have been isolated from neotrop ical cricetid and hystricomorph rodents and mar supials in those places. Thus, Gumbo Limbo (Group C), Shark River and Pahayokee (Patois serogroup), and Mahogany Hammock (Guama serogroup) bunyaviruses and the flavivirus, Cow- bone Ridge, have been isolated in Florida; the Latin American corollaries of these viruses are Nepuyo, Patois and Zegla, CoAn 49888 and Ju- tiapa viruses, respectively. It may be that, as with the arenavirus Tamiami virus, cricetid rodents reinvading North America were infected with vi ruses from South America; or perhaps the viruses had an earlier distribution in Florida but were isolated from the neotropical habitat by geologic changes.36 Antigenically unrelated viruses may utilize sim ilar modes of nonarthropod enzootic dissemina tion. Modoc virus, the most extensively studied of the complex, was first isolated from the mammary gland of Peromyscus maniculatus and has since been shown to localize in mammary' tissue of lac- tating female mice fed on SM infected with the virus."" Modoc virus has been recovered from sal ivary glands, lungs, kidneys, throat swabs and urine of rodents experimentally infected by sub cutaneous or intranasal routes.6""9 Like Modoc, Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Sal Vieja and other FUAS of rodents may also be transmitted inde pendently of arthropod intermediates. Most of the FUAS isolated from bats have been isolated from salivary glands, yet no significant antigenic relationships between these or other fla- viviruses exist. Batu Cave, Phnom Penh bat, and Carey Island viruses have all been isolated from salivary glands of Cynopterus brachyotis (fruit- eating bats) of Southeast Asia.1 Despite this, Ca rey Island virus is more closely related to Dakar bat and Saboya viruses. By contrast, Phnom Penh bat and Batu Cave viruses are cross-reactive in CF and N tests and therefore are strains of the same virus. The nearly simultaneous registration of these viruses precluded recognition of their an tigenic similarity.1'17 Bukalasa bat, Dakar bat, and Entebbe bat vi ruses have been isolated exclusively from salivary glands of African bats.18 In CF tests, antibody to Entebbe bat virus reacts to high titer only with Sokuluk antigen, as reported by Lvov.37 It is in teresting that both Entebbe bat and Sokuluk vi ruses replicate in C6/36 cells. Bukalasa bat and Dakar bat viruses are distinct from one another by both CF and N tests, as ini tially shown by Karabatsos.26 Serosurveys of in sectivorous bat populations demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to Dakar bat, Bukalasa bat, and Entebbe bat viruses.37'38 The tropism of these agents for vertebrate salivary glands, and the failure of investigators to isolate them from arthropods,14'33'38 suggest direct transmission by biting or licking, or by aerosolized droplets. Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis, TamaÃ±abat, and Rio Bravo viruses of the Western Hemisphere are also excreted in saliva of asymptomatic bats. Despite years of field investigations in the enzootic area, Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis virus has not been isolated from mosquitoes or ticks.16 Rio Bravo virus, ubiquitous in dense bat populations roosting in poorly ventilated caves,5 is present in salivary glands, kidneys, and mammary tissues of experimental hosts"" and has produced human in fections, implying direct aerosol transmission.2-5 Attempts to incriminate bat ectoparasites as vec tors were unsuccessful.5 The serologie studies re ported here show these three isolates from insec tivorous bats are minimally cross-reactive and antigenically distinct. By CF, Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis is antigenically remote from oth er viruses tested, confirming previous studies.2"" Only when normal monkey serum was used as diluent did neutralization of Rio Bravo virus by antibody to Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis vi rus occur.2"" In contrast, Bell and Thomas report ed one-way reactions by CF between Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis, Entebbe bat, and SLE (Parton strain) viruses.16 In this study, Rio Bravo and SLE reacted reciprocally to low titer in CF tests, in contrast to the high titer reactions re ported by Sulkin and Allen2 who used guinea pig hyperimmune sera. In summary, the flaviviruses with undeter mined arthropod-borne status may be broadly di vided into two biologic groups; the first repre- RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN FLAVIVIRUSES 1283 sented by Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi, and Aroa viruses. The second includes viruses isolated exclusively from rodents and bats and for which no evidence of vector in termediates has been found; however, Saboya, Sokuluk, and Entebbe bat viruses, replicate in C6/36 cells. The Modoc-Rio Bravo antigenic com plex of Johnson"" is expanded to include, in addi tion to Rio Bravo and Modoc viruses, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, and Apoi viruses. Phnom Penh bat, TamaÃ±abat, and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses appear to be dis tinct; sufficient data are not yet available to place these three viruses into either of the above biologic groupings.

Groschup1 Abstract Mosquito-borne viruses are becoming an increasing threat for Europe. One of these viruses is Usutu virus (USUV), a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group within the family Flaviviridae. Since the occurrence of USUV among wild birds in June, 2011, infected Blackbirds (Turdus merula) have frequently been found dead in southwest Germany, cumulating in a massive die-off. Moreover, other bird species (Strigiformes) in this region have been affected. In a first study, 209 of over 600 dead birds (wild birds and birds kept in aviaries) collected from 2011 to 2013 carried USUV, more than 88% of them Blackbirds. USUV had already been detected in 2010, one year before the epizooty, in a mosquito-based surveillance program in Germany. The main epidemic area of the USUV outbreak in wild birds in southwest Germany has been similar for the last three years. In a second study during 2011 to 2013, 902 live migratory and resident birds (representing 87 bird species belonging to 14 bird orders) from four different sampling sites were bled and tested serologically and by qPCR for West Nile virus (WNV) and USUV infections. No USUV or WNV genomes were detected. Some migratory birds (mainly long-distance migrants and some partial migrants) carried neutralizing antibodies against WNV as discriminated by USUV and WNV cross-neutralization tests. Only few resident birds showed relevant USUV-specific neutralizing antibodies. The occurrence of USUV in the Upper Rhine valley area of southwest Germany is a proof of principle for the incursion and spread of other arthropod-borne (arbo)-viruses along these routes. Therefore, monitoring studies in birds and mosquitoes for the presence of arboviruses in these areas are indispensable. Key Words: Arbovirus—Usutu virus—West Nile virus—Germany—Birds—Monitoring. Introduction Usutu virus (USUV) is an arthropod-borne (arbo),single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group within the family Flaviviridae. The virus is preserved in the environment through a vertebrate host–mosquito life cycle. USUV is closely related to West Nile virus (WNV), which has killed thousands of birds in North America following its introduction in 1999. Since the emergence of USUV in Italy in 1996 (Weissenböck et al. 1Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany. 2German Mosquito Control Association (KABS) Speyer, Germany. 3Department of Veterinary Medicine, Small Animal Clinic, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 4Clinic for Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians and Fish, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany. 5Clinic for Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians and ornamental Fish, Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Oberschleißheim, Germany. 6Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany. 7State Institute for Chemical and Veterinary Analysis (CVUA), Freiburg, Germany. 8State Institute for Chemical and Veterinary Analysis (CVUA), Karlsruhe, Germany. 9Landesbetrieb Hessisches Landeslabor, Veterinary virology and molecular biology, Giessen, Germany. 10Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart, Germany. 11Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM), Department of Virology, Hamburg, Germany.

F or p er so na l u se o nl y. 2013), it has spread to several other European countries. The most important outbreak of USUV occurred in 2001 in and around Vienna, Austria, with a significant wild bird mortal- ity, primarily in common Blackbirds (Turdus merula), but also in different captive bird species, such as Great Grey Owls (Strix nebulosa) (Weissenböck et al. 2002, Chvala et al. 2004). Thereafter, USUV has been demonstrated to circulate in different other European countries, including Austria, Hun- gary, Switzerland, Spain (only mosquitoes), and again in Italy (Bakonyi et al. 2007, Busquets et al. 2008, Manarolla et al. 2010, Steinmetz et al. 2011). Neutralizing antibodies against USUV have also been demonstrated in birds from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Czech Republic (Buckley et al. 2003, Hubálek et al. 2008a, b). In contrast, no serological evidence for USUV circulation was found in birds from Germany between 2007 and 2011 (Seidowski et al. 2010, Ziegler et al. 2012). WNV-specific antibodies were found exclusively in migratory birds, but not in resident birds. WNV, as an important arbovirus with sig- nificant zoonotic potential, has been present in southern and central Europe for a long time with increasing case numbers, especially in Italy, Hungary, and Greece recently (Di Saba- tino et al. 2014). Because migratory birds play an important role in spreading WNV, we also tested samples from these birds for WNV in these studies. In August of 2010, USUV strain 1477 was isolated from a pool of Culex pipiens pipiens mosquitoes that had been trapped in the Rhine Neckar area (Weinheim) in the south- west of Germany. Interestingly, all mosquitoes trapped in this area one year before (2009) were tested negative for USUV ( Jöst et al. 2011). No obvious increase in mortality of wild and captive birds was observed in southwest Germany in 2009 and 2010. However, starting in June, 2011, Blackbirds were frequently found dead around the cities of Mannheim and Heidelberg in southwestern Germany. Becker et al. (2012) detected several USUV-infected birds by qRT-PCR between June and November, 2011, primarily in the lowland river ecosystem of the Upper Rhine valley. Apart from wild birds, birds kept in aviaries were also affected. Phylogenetic analysis of the German USUV strain revealed a close rela- tionship with strain Vienna, which had caused mass mortality among birds in Austria in 2001 (Becker et al. 2012). Re- cently, the ongoing spread of USUV in Europe has been confirmed by its detection in 2011 and 2012 in wild birds in the Czech Republic (Hubálek et al. 2014), Belgium (Gar- igliany et al. 2014), and Spain (Höfle et al. 2013). USUV neutralizing antibodies recently have been found in magpies in France (Vittecoq et al. 2013) and in horses in Croatia (Barbic et al. 2013). USUV has a zoonotic potential, especially in older and immunocompromised humans, and should therefore be included as differential diagnosis for humans with neuro- logical symptoms in regions with USUV-associated bird fatalities (Vazquez et al. 2011). In January of 2012, 4200 serum samples from healthy blood donors from southwest Germany (USUV main epidemic area) were analyzed; one sample tested positive for USUV-specific immuno- globulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies (Allering et al. 2012). This prompted an increased monitoring of USUV anti- bodies in healthy blood donors from southwest Germany in January, 2012. This study tracked the geographical distribution of mass mortality in wild and captive birds in southwest Germany in the years from 2011 to 2013 and the detection of USUV in the different bird species as the causative agent (first study). Furthermore, the objective was to continue the serological and molecular surveillance for USUV and WNV in wild birds (second study) and to expand these investigations against the background of an acute USUV infection in the wild bird population in southwest Germany. Materials and Methods Bird sample collection From 2011 to 2013, 663 dead birds (first study), especially from southwest Germany, were collected and tested for the presence of viral pathogens. The dead birds were collected by the local veterinary authorities and/or by the local state veterinary laboratories and by assistants of the German Mosquito Control Association (KABS) or Nature and Bio- diversity Conservation Union (NABU). For further investi- gations, the birds or organ material of the birds were submitted to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) or to the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM). Strongly autolyzed bird carcasses were not processed further. The second study included a panel of 902 blood samples from migratory and resident birds belonging to 88 avian species of 14 bird orders (mainly passerines and raptors) for investigation by virus neutralization test (VNT) and PCR (see Table 1). These wild bird blood samples were collected in the period from 2011 to 2013 in cooperation with different bird clinics or ornithologists at multiple rural and urban locations in four different parts of Germany. The first location was in the larger Berlin/Brandenburg suburban area, which is part of the Central European lowland area, the second one in central Germany in Hesse in the region around Giessen, the third one in the southeast of Germany around Munich, and the fourth one in the southwest at ‘‘Eich-Gimbsheimer Altrhein’’ nature reserve, lowland river valley ecosystem. The geographical locations of the four sampling sites and the zoological orders of examined wild birds are depicted in Figure 1. Table 1.

Real-time RT-PCR Dead birds (first study) were dissected, and viral RNA was extracted from tissues (brain, liver, spleen, heart, and/or lung, depending on availability) using the RTP DNA/RNA Virus Mini Kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany) or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. RNA from avian blood samples (from the sec- ond study, preferentially cruor) was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Extracted RNA was analyzed using an USUV- and WNV-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described by Jöst et al. (2011) and Eiden et al. (2010), respectively. Serological investigations All bird serum samples (only from second study) were tested for antibodies against USUV strain Germany (acc. no. HE599647) using a VNT. To reveal cross-reactions with other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup, all wild bird samples were also assayed in parallel for WNV- neutralizing antibodies using WNV strain Austria (acc. no. HM015884, kindly provided by N. Nowotny, Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna). However, due to low sample volumes, VNT with USUV and WNV was not always possible. In these cases, priority was given to the investigation for USUV-specific antibodies. The experimental conditions for the VNT were described by Seidowski et al. (2010). All samples were run in duplicate; cytopathic effects were revealed 6–7 days postinfection, and VNT titers were calculated. The neutralizing antibody titer, the neutralization dose 50% (ND50) of a serum defined as the maximum dilution that inhibited cytopathic effects in 50% of the wells was calculated according to the Behrens–Kaerber method. ND50 values of above 10 were considered positive. Ethics statement Blood samples (only second study) were taken during routine clinical examination of injured, diseased, or orphaned wild birds that had been admitted to the three bird clinics (Berlin, Giessen, and Munich) and in the frame of the project ‘‘Integrated songbird monitoring at Eich-Gimbsheimer- Altrhein’’ by the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Institute of Zoology (www.ismega.de). Results In the period 2011 to 2013, over 600 dead wild birds were collected mainly in the Upper Rhine valley (southwestern Germany), but also in the central and northern part of Ger- many. These birds were sent to the BNITM or the FLI for FIG. 1. Location of sampling sites of wild bird species (second study) from 2011–2013 (only blood samples).

These were 89 birds from June to December of 2011, 95 birds in 2012, and 25 birds in 2013 (Table 2). USUV-RNA–positive birds belonged to 11 avian species and were mainly detected in the Upper Rhine Valley (Baden-Württemberg), in the south of Hesse and in Rhine- land-Palatinate (Fig. 2). To date, the most northern case of an USUV infection has been detected in Cologne in a Blackbird in 2012, thereby affecting a fourth federal state in northwest Germany, namely North-Rhine Westphalia. Similar to 2011, monitoring for USUV infection in 2013 was again only run in Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, and Rhineland-Palatinate. Dead birds were collected throughout the years, but positively tested birds were found primarily from June to September. WNV RNA was not detected in any of the tested dead birds. Serum samples of 902 wild birds from four different sampling sites were collected for a second study from 2011 to 2013 (Fig. 1). In 2011, most wild birds were captured in the larger Berlin/Brandenburg suburban area. Since 2012, the sampling sites have been expanded to regions where USUV had been detected in wild birds or to neighboring regions. In detail, the added sampling sites were located in central Hesse (around Giessen) and in southeast Bavaria (around Munich). Unfortunately, sampling in the ‘‘Eich-Gimbsheimer Altr- hein’’ nature reserve in the main epidemic USUV area was only realized in 2012. To reveal cross-reactions among the relevant flaviviruses in Germany, serum samples of wild birds (second study) were tested in an USUV-VNT and WNV-VNT. Serum samples from 45 of 902 wild birds were positive for WNV-neutralizing antibodies. This includes 22 of 274 (8.03%) tested birds of diurnal raptors (birds of prey and falcons), whereas only six of 310 (1.94%) passerines carried WNV-specific antibodies. Other positive birds belonged to ten other bird orders. VNT titers ranged from 10 to 320 ND50, as displayed in Table 3. In all 45 WNV antibody-positive animals, the USUV titers were negative (ND50 <10) or significantly lower (in average two- fold lower) than the corresponding WNV neutralization titers, respectively. Furthermore, eight of the 902 (0.89%) bird samples showed USUV neutralizing antibodies ranging from 20 to 480 ND50. Of the eight USUV antibody-positive birds, primarily from the ‘‘Eich-Gimbsheimer Altrhein’’ sampling site, three samples demonstrated significantly lower or no WNV titers (Table 3) and five samples were excluded from WNV-VNT due to small sample volume. WNV- or USUV-specific RNA was not detected in any of the investigated bird blood samples from the second study. Because 83 samples from the ‘‘Eich-Gimbsheimer Altrhein’’ sampling site had to be excluded from RNA isolation (because there were no means to cool these samples properly after bleeding as done at the other three sampling sites), only 819 blood samples from the overall 902 birds could be investigated. Discussion Our data (first study) show that USUV infections in wild birds occurred in southwest Germany, the border triangle between Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Hesse, in the Upper Rhine valley in three consecutive years (2011–2013), which means that this virus infection was widely distributed in the local bird populations (Fig. 2). Several wild bird species belonging to different bird orders were affected (Table 2). Up to now, no cases north of Co- logne and the Siegen area have been detected. The German USUV outbreak showed a similarly low spreading tendency, Table 2.

F or p er so na l u se o nl y. as described for the Austrian outbreak (Hassler et al. 2004). Weissenböck et al. (2003) determined that USUV has a clearly slower spreading tendency (no further than 200 km per year) than other mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, such as WNV. The extension of the endemic area in Austria from the 2001 to the 2002 season had a radius of only approximately 30 km. This may be due to the fact that the Blackbird, which seems to play a pivotal role, is a strongly territorial species with little tendency to fly greater distances, especially during the breeding season (Weissenböck et al. 2003). Furthermore also Cx. pipiens, the main mosquito species involved in the trans- mission of USUV (Calzolari et al. 2012), only migrates a few hundred meters around the breeding sites (Hamer et al. 2014). Blackbirds in particular seem to be more susceptible to USUV infection than other bird species (Weissenböck et al. 2003). Thus, it is not surprising that 185 out of 209 USUV- positive birds in the above-mentioned time period in Germany were Blackbirds (88%). However, Strigiformes (most of them captive) were also among the affected bird species (Table 2). Similar observations were made by Man- arolla et al. (2010) and Steinmetz et al. (2011) in former USUV outbreaks in wild and captive birds. The decline in the number of infected birds in 2013 seemed to continue in 2014 (only five cases). Future analyses should clarify whether USUV infections have induced herd immunity in the bird population at risk, thereby impeding the mosquito- bird life cycle of the virus, or whether predators and climate factors are involved in this development. Similarly, there is evidence that outbreaks of USUV in Europe caused regional declines and temporary local eradi- cations of European Blackbird (T. merula) populations. It is likely that declines of other bird species are significantly underestimated and unrecorded. A review (Bosch et al. 2012) analyzing the European outbreaks of the virus examining >3050 birds of 128 species found that 48 species tested positive for USUV (39 free-living, nine captive). In addition to Blackbirds, other species included House Sparrows (Pas- ser domesticus), Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), corvids, and captive owls. However, Blackbirds seem to be the most af- fected bird species in Europe (Bosch et al. 2012). Dramatic local declines were also observed in Germany. The 2011 outbreak in southwestern Germany (Becker et al. 2012) caused a 74% decline of local Blackbird breeding pairs from >50 before 2011 to 12 in 2013 near the city of Heidelberg (M. Wink, pers. comm.). A garden bird watch project (Stunde der Gartenvögel, NABU) also revealed noticeable declines in and around the outbreak region (Bosch and Schmidt-Chanasit 2011). In countries where dead Blackbirds tested USUV- positive, the breeding population declined by 34% (Bosch and Lachmann, unpublished data). Increased mortality in Table 3.

European Blackbird populations due to USUV epidemics is likely to become a common feature for some time. Model calculations predict periodic USUV outbreaks and in worst- case scenarios declines of Blackbird populations of up to 24% (Brugger and Rubel 2009). Fifty different mosquito species are known in Germany, and several of these have vector competence for pathogens (i.e., WNV, USUV, Sindbis or Batai virus). Examples for USUV competence are Cx. pipiens, Cx. torrentium, Cx. modestus, or Ochlerotatus cantans (Becker et al. 2014). During the last few years, a number of mosquito and patho- gen surveillance projects for risk assessment have been ini- tiated in Germany. Due to the introduction of USUV into local bird popula- tions in southwest Germany and the intensified investigation of vector mosquitoes, we have increased our efforts to ob- serve a large panel of wild birds distributed over Germany. Furthermore, we have expanded our investigations to the detection of USUV- or WNV-neutralizing antibodies and RNA in these samples. Moreover, we have been able to ex- pand our sampling sites in or near the USUV main epidemic area (Fig. 1). To increase the significance of our results, we carried out the serological study with the local USUV strain Germany and the ‘‘more local’’ WNV strain Austria. A continuously increasing proportion of seropositive wild birds during the USUV outbreak in Austria had been de- scribed by Meister et al. (2008). More than 50% antibody- positive birds were reported after the USUV outbreak in Austria, which indicated the formation of herd immunity. However, only a few birds were USUV seropositive in the study presented here (0.89%/8 sera). Seven seropositive birds from the outbreak area (‘‘Eich-Gimbsheimer-Altrhein’’) were resident species (i.e., Common Chaffinch or Great Tit). The low rate of USUV-seropositive birds may be due to the early time point in the epidemic. Future studies, especially more blood samples from southwest Germany, will show whether this rate will increase over time; therefore, the monitoring study in wild birds needs to be continued. Most of the 45 WNV antibody-positive wild birds (second study) were migratory birds that had overwintering grounds in WNV endemic areas in Africa and/or southern Europe. Likewise antibody titers in these birds were usually quite low. Migratory birds are considered to act as carry-over vectors for introduction of the virus into new regions and countries (Brault et al. 2009). Eight WNV antibody-positive birds were resident and facultative partial migrants, such as Common Blackbirds (two), Eurasian Jays (two), Great Tit (one), Northern Goshawk (one), Barn Owl (one), and Great Spotted Woodpecker (one). VNT antibody titers in these bird sera were generally low (dilutions of 10–20). WNV-specific nu- cleic acids could not be detected in any of the bird blood samples either. Therefore, there is currently no indication for the presence of active WNV infections in resident and mi- gratory birds in Germany. These data are in accordance with several other WNV surveillance studies carried out in the past (Linke et al. 2007, Seidowski et al. 2010, Ziegler et al. 2012). Furthermore, no WNV-specific RNA has been detected in the different German mosquito surveillance systems to date (Becker et al. 2014, J. Schmidt-Chanasit, pers. comm.). The USUV incursion in the Upper Rhine valley provides proof of principle for the incursion of other vector-borne flaviviruses into the same area. WNV endemic regions in Hungary and northern Italy are not far away from Germany. Therefore, state-of-the-art monitoring systems for emerging viruses are mandatory. These systems should combine hu- man, bird, and mosquito surveillance programs to ensure an early detection of new epidemics.

Wang-2009-Japanese encephalitis viruses from b.pdf	"Japanese Encephalitis Viruses from Bats in Yunnan, China Jing-Lin Wang,1 Xiao-Ling Pan,1 Hai-Lin Zhang, Shi-Hong Fu, Huan-Yu Wang, Qing Tang, Lin-Fa Wang, and Guo-Dong Liang Genome sequencing and virulence studies of 2 Jap- anese encephalitis viruses (JEVs) from bats in Yunnan, China, showed a close relationship with JEVs isolated from mosquitoes and humans in the same region over 2 decades. These results indicate that bats may play a role in human Japanese encephalitis outbreaks in this region. Bats have been increasingly recognized as an important source of zoonotic viruses responsible for some of the recent major disease outbreaks, including Hendra, Nipah, severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated, and Ebola viruses (1). Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mem- ber of the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus (2) and is the etiologic agent of severe encephalitic diseases in humans. In addition to humans, JEV has been isolated from various hosts, e.g., mosquitoes, birds, pigs, and horses (3,4). The role of bats in JEV epidemiology has been poor- ly defined, although the virus has been isolated from bats of various species since 1963 in multiple locations (5,6). To date, no nucleotide sequence information has been avail- able for bat JEV isolates. Yunnan Province, in southern China, has a tropical to subtropical climate and a diverse biota. The annual case rate of Japanese encephalitis in Yunnan is >2× the aver- age case rate of the whole country (7). We report the mo- lecular and virulence characterization of 2 bat JEV isolates from Yunnan: B58, obtained from a Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia), a fruit bat, in 1989; and GB30, obtained from a little tube-nosed bat (Murina aurata), an insectivore, in 1997. The Study The viruses used in this study were isolated from ho- mogenates of the brains of bats by direct intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of 3-day-old suckling mice. Although isolate B58 was obtained in 1989, no further identification or characterization was conducted until this study. GB30 was identified as JEV by serologic analysis (8). Inoculation in suckling mice was conducted following procedures ap- proved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China. Mice were observed 2× per day after inoculation, and every 2 hours after the onset of clinical signs. After euthanasia, superna- tant from brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells. After the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), su- pernatant was harvested and passaged 3 more times. Virus stock was prepared from the previous passage and stored at –85oC. Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV strains and of a mos- quito-derived JEV strain, M10 (9), were determined. All viruses were consecutively passed 3 times in mice, and virus suspension (defined as the 10–1 stock) was prepared from the third passage. For determination of a 50% lethal dose (LD50), suckling mice (5 per group) were inoculated i.c. with dilutions from 10–1 to 10–9. Animals were moni- tored daily for survival, and the LD50 values were calcu- lated by using a standard method (10). Viral RNA was isolated by using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the Ready-To-Go kit (Amersham Phar- macia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Flavivirus-specific primers (11) and primers designed from the sequence of JEV Beijing-1 (L48916) were used for PCR and sequenc- ing. Sequence assembly was conducted by using the ATGC software package, version 4.0 (GENETYX Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Homology and alignment analysis were con- ducted by using ClustalX version 1.8 (www.clustal.org/ download/1.X/ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX) and MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). MEGA 3.1 (12) was used for phylogenetic analysis. For initial studies, suckling mice were inoculated i.c. with the supernatant of clarified brain homogenate. The 2 groups (n = 8 for each) inoculated with B58 and GB30, re- spectively, displayed clinical signs after 42 h postinocula- tion (hpi), whereas the control group with buffer only (n = 8) displayed no clinical signs. Clinical signs included refus- ing sucking, no interest in grouping, neck rigidity, tremors and muscular spasms, ataxia, and hind-limb paralysis. All mice had to be euthanized from 70 to 78 hpi. The superna- tant of brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells, and CPE was visible at ≈96 hpi for the first passage and at 72 hpi for second and third passages.

Wang) DOI: 10.3201/eid1506.081525 The identity of B58 as JEV was confirmed by PCR sequencing. The complete genome sequence of both iso- lates was then determined. The 2 genomes have identical size at 10,977 nt with a 95-nt 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) and a 583-nt 3′ NTR. The single open reading frame codes for a polyprotein of 3,432 aa. The genomes have similar guanine-cytosine content (51.44% for B58 and 51.39% for GB30). The 2 bat JEV isolates have an overall sequence iden- tity of 99.9% both at nt and aa levels. When compared to 55 known JEV isolates of known complete genome sequenc- es, the nt sequence identity varies from 88.6% to 99.3%, and aa sequence identity from 97.0% to 99.3%. Analysis of the NTR sequences showed that the bat JEV isolates have the same 5′ NTR as do the others, but the 3′ NTRs of the bat JEVs have a G insertion at nt 307, the same as that observed in the Nakayama strain (GenBank accession no. EF571853). Phylogenetic trees derived from nucleotide sequences of the complete genome or the most variable envelope pro- tein gene of selected JEV strains (Table 1) indicated that both JEV isolates from bats are members of genotype III as defined by Solomon et al. (3). A more detailed analysis in- dicated that the bat JEVs are most closely related to human isolate LiYujie and mosquito isolate BN19 within cluster 6 (Figure). Similar phylogenetic trees were obtained based on other gene sequences, such as PrM (data not shown). Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV isolates was deter- mined as described above, and the LD50 for suckling mice was 8.0 log10/0.02 mL, compared with 3.5 log10/0.02 mL for the mosquito strain M10. Neurovirulence of these 2 bat isolates also was predicted from aa sequence comparison to those known to have high neurovirulence (13,14). As shown in Table 2, all residues important for virulence and neurotropism were conserved between the bat JEV isolates and the Nakayama strain. Conclusions In this study, we analyzed the complete genome se- quences of 2 bat JEV isolates. Although previous serologic studies (15) have indicated the occurrence of JEV in a Le- schenault’s rousette, we demonstrate JEV infection of Ma- rina aurata bats, confirming that the same JEV genotype can infect bats of many species.

NA, information not available. JEV from Bats, China in Yunnan Province and other parts of China. The bats tend to roost in trees, caves, and roofs of residential properties in close proximity to rice paddocks and pig pens, provid- ing ample opportunity for cross-species transmission among bats and between bats and other animals. Notably, the 2 JEV strains most closely related to the bat viruses were all iso- lated from Yunnan Province, LiYujie from a human in 1979 and BN19 from mosquitoes in 1982 (Figure). Our study indicates that the same virus is circulating in hosts of at least 4 different species (human, mosquito, and 2 different bat species), and likely in birds as well, highlight- ing the broad host range of JEVs in this area. We empha- size that the 4 closely related strains (B58, GB30, LiYujie, and BN19) were isolated over 2 decades, which suggests that the virus was stably maintained in the region, perhaps by circulating in disparate hosts. The findings from our cur- rent study highlight the potential importance of bats in hu- man JE outbreaks in the region. Needed additional studies of JEV in bats should include the determination of viremia in bats of different species and potential seasonal variation of viral loads among different bats at different geographic locations. This data would provide a better assessment of risks posed by JEV in bats.

"Weissenbock-2013-Usutu virus, Italy, 1996.pdf"	"Usutu Virus, Italy, 1996 Herbert Weissenböck, Tamás Bakonyi, Giacomo Rossi, Paolo Mani, and Norbert Nowotny Retrospective analysis of archived tissue samples from bird deaths in the Tuscany region of Italy in 1996 identified Usutu virus. Partial sequencing confirmed iden- tity with the 2001 Vienna strain and provided evidence for a much earlier introduction of this virus into Europe than previously assumed. In early fall 1996, an episode of wild bird deaths occurred in the provinces of Florence and Pistoia (Tuscany re- gion), Italy. Several bird species were affected; however, most observed bird carcasses were Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula). Several animals were subjected to nec- ropsy, which predominantly showed swollen livers and spleens, necrotizing pericloacal dermatitis, and a variety of endoparasites. Bacteriologic, virologic, and toxicologic investigations produced no conclusive results. Formalin- fixed and paraffin wax–embedded tissue samples were archived. This event was reported in an Italian veterinary journal with local distribution and thus did not receive broad attention (1) Five years later in late summer 2001, similar seasonal deaths of wild birds, again predominantly blackbirds, were observed in neighboring Austria (2). A particular strain of Usutu virus (USUV) was determined as the causative agent of this fatal bird disease outbreak, which recurred in Austria in subsequent years (3), and was later identified in Hungary (4), Switzerland (5), Italy (6), and Germany (7). There were similarities between 1996 bird deaths in Tuscany and subsequent USUV-associated bird deaths in other areas of Europe. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed archived paraffin wax–embedded material from the Tus- cany cases for USUV. The Study Thirty-three paraffin blocks generally containing mul- tiple tissue samples (such as brain, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, proventriculus, gizzard, intestine, pancreas, and skeletal muscle) were used for detection of USUV. Most organ samples were from blackbirds, but some were from other bird species (Table). Tissue blocks were assigned to 4 groups: group 1 (7 blocks, blackbirds found dead or se- verely ill during August 28–September 25, 1996); group 2 (6 blocks, blackbirds found during October 1–November 19, 1996); group 3 (10 blocks, blackbirds, starlings [Stur- nus vulgaris], and redwings [Turdus iliacus] found during August 3–September 18, 1997); and group 4 (10 blocks, blackbirds and fieldfares [T. pilaris] found during October 5–December 20, 1997). Recut samples from these blocks were placed on positively charged slides (Superfrost plus; Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and processed for immunohis- tochemical staining by using a rabbit USUV-specific anti- body at a dilution of 1:4,000. Immunohistochemical analy- sis was performed by using an automated immunostainer (Autostainer 360–2D; Thermo-Fisher, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). From the same paraffin blocks, three 10 µm–thick samples were cut and used for RNA extraction. Viral RNA was purified from paraffin-embedded tis- sue samples by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) after deparaffinization with xylene. Because of the formaldehyde fixation, the paraf- fin wax embedding procedure, and the long storage time, a high degree of RNA fragmentation was expected. There- fore, the PCR-based nucleic acid detection methods were specific for short (<300 nt) sequences. In a TaqMan-based real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), genomic (5′-GCCAATGCCCTGCACTTT-3′) and reverse (5′-TCCCGAGGAGGGTTTCCA-3′) prim- ers amplify part of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) gene region of USUV between nt positions 9721 and 9795 (ac- cording to the USUV complete genome sequence, Gen- Bank accession no. NC_006551). The TaqMan probe (FAM-5′-CGATGTCCAAGGTCAGAAAAGACGTGC- 3′-TAMRA) hybridizes the amplification product between nt positions 9746 and 9773. The SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for amplifications according to the manufac- turer’s instructions. Primers and probe were used at concen- trations of 0.2 µmol/L. Reactions were performed in an Ap- plied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) 7300 Real Time PCR System with a thermal profile of 48°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min, and 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C, for 30 sec. Selected real-time RT-PCR virus-positive samples were also tested by using conventional RT-PCRs that gen- erated short amplification products. Two primer pairs (Usu9247f-Usu9445r and Usu10626f-Usu10828) (6) ampli- fied specific products. Nucleotide sequences of real-time and conventional RT-PCR amplification products were determined and identified by using a BLAST search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/). Sequences were aligned with USUV sequences DISPATCHES 274 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 19, No. 2, February 2013 Author affiliations: University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Aus- tria (H.

Phlyogenetic analysis with the neighbor-joining algorithm was performed to infer genetic relatedness between sequences. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive results for USUV in several brain samples (Figure 1) and 1 kidney sample from only group 1 blocks. Liver, lung, spleen, and proventriculus were negative for USUV. In all blocks from the other 3 groups, there was no specific staining. Results of real-time RT-PCR were positive for all samples from group 1; samples from other groups were negative. Nucleotide sequences of amplification products were 100% identical with available USUV sequences in GenBank. Selected samples (brains for group 1) were also positive by conventional RT-PCRs. Nucleotide sequences of the amplification products in the partial NS5 gene region (between nt positions 9267 and 9425, excluding primer sequences) were 100% identi- cal with the corresponding sequences of USUV detected in Austria in 2001 and in Italy and in Switzerland in 2006. Sequences were 98.7%–99.3% identical with other USUV sequences from Austria, Italy, Hungary, and Germany. However, these sequences were only 95.6% identical with USUV detected in Spain in 2009 and 96.2% identical with the reference strain isolated in South Africa in 1959. Phylogenetic relatedness of sequences is shown in Figure 2. Nucleotide sequences of the 3′ untranslated region (between nt positions 10646 and 10808) were 100% identi- cal with USUV sequences from central Europe and 98.1% identical with the reference strain from South Africa. Conclusions These investigations provide evidence that USUV emerged in a pathogenic form in Europe in 1996 or even earlier. This date is >5 years before USUV-associated bird deaths in Vienna, Austria (2), which has been generally as- sumed to have been the starting point of the spread of the virus to other countries in Europe. Partial sequencing of the 1996 strain confirmed its identity with the 2001 Vienna strain and all its descendants. However, the assumed epi- center of virus spread being Austria must be reconsidered Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 19, No. 2, February 2013 275 Table. Results of IHC analysis and real-time RT-PCR for Usutu virus in birds, Italy, 1996* Group, protocol no. because the source has been in Italy much longer and may have given rise to subsequent local episodes of bird deaths in Italy and other countries. USUV has an established stable mosquito-to-bird transmission cycle in Europe, which can remain silent for many seasons. There are no reports of bird deaths during 1996–2001, which might have been caused by unfavorable climatic conditions or lack of larger numbers of susceptible birds. Local herd immunity (8) prevented further bird deaths and supported silent spread of the virus. Large-scale wild bird deaths, as later reported in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany (2,3,5,7), had not been observed in Italy, despite widespread viral activity (6,9). Introduction of a potential- ly pathogenic vector-borne virus into a new area does not necessarily lead to immediate deaths, which has been re- peatedly shown by seropositivity of sentinel birds or virus detection in vectors before epidemics (10,11). Episodes of bird deaths tend to occur when virus spreads to areas without prior exposure, thus affecting virus-naive birds. Also, specif- ic climatic conditions, such as longer periods of hot and dry weather, seem to affect vector abundance and competence and efficient virus transmission to susceptible hosts (12). There is evidence for introduction of other USUV strains into Europe. Direct evidence exists for a strain so far found only in mosquitoes in Spain, which is genetically different from the strain from central Europe (13,14). This strain has never been associated with bird deaths, which might have resulted from its lower virulence, but low lev- els of bird deaths might have occurred unnoticed. Thus, results of studies in the United Kingdom that reported several USUV seroreactive resident birds without obvious bird deaths may be explained accordingly (15).

Wild populations of nonhuman primates live in regions of sylvatic arbovirus transmission. To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviral infections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown. INTRODUCTION Most arboviruses are perpetuated in transmission cycles independent of human hosts.1 Those that exist in sylvatic cycles often infect people who accidentally intrude on these cycles. Less frequently, arboviruses may make the jump from a sylvatic transmission cycle to a mainly human-mos- quito transmission cycle, as has presumably happened for Chikungunya virus.2 In other cases, humans are dead-end hosts in complex transmission cycles involving multiple wild and domestic vertebrate hosts, as in Japanese encephalitis virus.3 Understanding the emergence of human arboviral dis- ease and developing surveillance methods to predict its oc- currence depends upon an understanding of the ecology of individual arboviruses and their life-cycles.4 Traditionally, mosquito sampling and direct sampling of forest-dwelling humans have been used to assess the pres- ence of sylvatic cycles. While viruses are more easily iso- lated from mosquitoes than from their vertebrate hosts, mos- quito based surveillance does not distinguish well between viruses likely to be able to infect humans and those that may be restricted to taxonomically distinct hosts. Direct human sampling is likely to identify relevant arboviruses, but due to dwindling numbers of forest-dwelling humans, adequate samples are often difficult to obtain. Wild populations of nonhuman primates have a number of features that make them useful sentinels for identifying sylvatic transmission of arboviruses relevant to humans.5 Human and nonhuman pri- mates share susceptibility to a wide range of pathogenic mi- croorganisms.6 Nonhuman primates live primarily in forested environments.7 They can have large body sizes and are often social, characteristics that attract vectors.8 Nonhuman pri- mates are also generally mobile, a trait that may increase exposure to pathogens.9,10 Nonhuman primates are also thought to play an important role in the sylvatic maintenance cycles of certain flavivirus- es, including yellow fever,11 dengue,12–14 and Zika,15 and al- phaviruses including, Chikungunya.16,17 While definitive proof that a particular nonhuman primate species is required for maintenance of any sylvatic cycle does not exist, the role that wild populations have played as sentinels for arbovirus- es is clear. The deaths of New World primates, particularly Howler monkeys (Alouatta sp.), have been used to accurate- ly signal yellow fever outbreaks.11 Furthermore, the exami- nation of wild primate deaths has led to the identification of novel arboviruses as in the case of the tick-borne flavivirus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, which was discovered follow- ing a die-off of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) and han- uman langurs (Presbytis entellus) in the Kyasanur Forest of India. Kyasanur Forest disease was retrospectively deter- mined to be a source of human illness in the area.18 While work with wild primate populations is limited by the many logistical problems associated with safely and ethically sam- pling from endangered and often remotely located popula- tions, a recent conservation project provided the opportunity to collect blood samples from wild and semi-captive orang- utans, endangered apes that are among our closest living relatives. These were tested serologically for arboviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study site and population. During 1996 and 1997, wild orangutans were translocated as part of a conservation pro- ject conducted by the Sabah Wildlife Department and the Wildlife Conservation Society. Wild individuals were trans- ferred from forest fragments in Eastern Sabah to the Tabin Wildlife Reserve.19 All forest fragments were within 200 km of the Tabin Wildlife Reserve. Forest fragments varied in size and were surrounded by oil palm plantations. The Tabin Wildlife Reserve consists of a 1,600 km2 tract of protected primary and secondary lowland tropical rain forest. Wild orangutans were captured using anaesthetic darts for trans- location and were subjected to a venous blood draw at that time. Orangutan samples were also collected from semi-captive individuals at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center (SOURC), located on the Northern edge of the Sepilok For- est Reserve, a 400 km2 track of protected primary and sec- ondary forest outside of Sandakan, Sabah. Semi-captive in- dividuals arrive at the SOURC following some level of con- tact with people. Upon arriving at the SOURC individuals are placed in quarantine for six months, after which they are held in a range of conditions from captivity to completely free-ranging. Orangutans at SOURC are provisioned daily with bananas and milk. From experience with semi-captive individuals of known age at the SOURC, wild and semi-captive individuals were categorized into four classes based on weight and dental morphology. These categories correspond to approximate age groups: infant, � 1 year; juvenile, 1–5 years; subadult, 6–10 years; and adult, � 10 years. The study was conducted with the approval of the direc- tors of the Sabah Health Department and the Sabah Wildlife Department. Ethical review and approval of the protocol was conducted by the National Research Review Committee of the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). The protocol was also reviewed and approved in the ethical review processes of the Institute of Medical Research (IMR), Kuala Lumpur, and the Sabah Health Department. Following informed consent, samples were also collected from adult humans, classified as either native-born Bornean or non-native-born Bornean (mi- grants), who lived or worked on the boundaries of the Se- pilok Forest Reserve. Following venipuncture, human and orangutan blood were processed identically. Blood sampling and serology. Prior to blood sampling, orangutans were immobilized using anaesthetic darts. Blood was collected in EDTA, centrifuged, and the plasma was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plasma samples were later tested for neutralizing antibody to eight viruses, including five fla- viviruses, two alphaviruses, and one bunyavirus (Table 1) at the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Fort Col- lins, Colorado.20 Sera were screened at a dilution of 1:10, and endpoint titrations were conducted for samples that test- ed positive (i.e., titer � 10) in the screening test. RESULTS A total of 185 individuals were sampled, including 40 wild orangutans, 31 semi-captive orangutans, and 114 hu- mans. Of the 114 humans sampled, 31 were native-born Bor- neans and 83 were migrants who had migrated to North Bor- neo from other islands in the southern Philippines and In- donesian archipelago. The orangutan samples were unevenly distributed with respect to age; the semi-captive population consisted primarily of juveniles, while the wild population consisted primarily of adults. The human samples were un- evenly distributed with respect to age and sex, and consisted primarily of adult males. Neutralizing antibody titers of greater than or equal to 20 were considered positive, a likely result of exposure to the tested virus or a very closely-related strain (Table 2). The results of endpoint titrations suggest that wild orangutans were infected with dengue-2 (DEN-2), Japanese encephalitis (JE), Zika, Tembusu (TMU), and Sindbis (SIN) viruses; semi-captive orangutans were infected with DEN-2, Zika, JE, Langat (LAN), and TMU viruses; humans living along the boundary of the Sepilok Forest Reserve were infected with DEN-2, JE, Zika, LAN, TMU, Chikungunya (CHIK), and Batai (BAT) viruses. Of these, LAN and CHIK viruses were found only among human migrants. At least one human and one orangutan were positive for each of the five flaviviruses examined (Table 3). Among hu- mans, native-Bornean and migrant populations differed with respect to frequency of DEN-2 virus infection with 37% of native Borneans positive versus 74% of migrants positive (G-test of independence [G] � 6.21, P � 0.05). There were no significant associations between flavivirus seropositivity and orangutan group status (i.e., wild or semi-captive) for any flavivirus.

Humans, overall, were more frequently infected (44%) with Zika virus than were orangutans (8%) (G � 14.6, P � 0.001). Of the two alphaviruses and one bunyavirus examined, humans were infected with all three, while orangutans were only infected with SIN virus (Table 4). CHIK virus was seen only among migrants and not among native-born Borneans or in either orangutan group. SIN virus was seen only among wild orangutans and not among semi-captive orangutans or humans. BAT virus was seen in only one human, a 43-year- old native-born Bornean man. Orangutan and human groups were also examined for se- ropositivity by age (Tables 5–7). The G-test of independence was used to assess possible associations between age group- ing and seropositivity for each virus. Age grouping and se- ropositivity were independent for all viruses in both orang- utan and human populations. DISCUSSION A number of arboviruses in the Indo-Australian archipel- ago exhibit a pattern of geographic distribution correspond- ing to the geographical deep-sea barriers of Wallace’s line which runs east of Borneo and south through to the east of Bali, and Weber’s line which runs west of Papua New Guin- ea and Australia (Figure 1). In the past, antibodies to JE virus were common among humans to the west of Wallace’s line while prevalence virtually disappeared to the east of Wallace’s line.21 In recent years, however, JE outbreaks have been documented in Papua New Guinea and the Torres Straits of Australia.22,23 Zika virus appears to occur only west of Wallace’s line,1 while CHIK virus exists mainly to the west of Weber’s line, but is also present in lower frequencies in Papua New Guinea.24 Conversely, Ross River virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus are present exclusively in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and have not been docu- mented west of Weber’s line.25 Other viruses, like DEN and SIN have distributions that do not correspond well to these geographic barriers, existing in all regions. It is likely that JE virus from the Oriental zoogeographic region and Murray Valley encephalitis and Ross River viruses from the Austra- lasian zoogeographic region have been geographically sep- arated for thousands or millions of years. It is only relatively recently, with the movements of humans and their domestic animals, that JE virus has had the opportunity to bridge this gap. For other viruses such as SIN and DEN, it remains unclear if their biohistorical distributions includes all regions or if human migrations have contributed to current distri- butions. However, evidence suggests that the DEN viruses evolved in Asia and spread around the world as commerce developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.26 A series of studies during the 1960s and early 1970s ex- amined arbovirus infections in Sarawak, Malaysian West Borneo. Using virus isolation from mosquitoes this group demonstrated the presence of enzootic JE, TMU, and SIN viruses in areas of rice padi and JE and SIN viruses in inland forest regions,27 as well as the presence of a Bunyamwera virus, isolated from a padi region. Serologic studies in hu- mans in Sarawak showed neutralizing antibody to DEN-2 (50%), JE (57%), TMU (22%), West Nile, and Getah virus- es.28 Bowen and others28 did not present neutralization test results for CHIK virus, but based on hemagglutination-in- hibition (HI) results concludes that it is common among hu- mans in Sarawak, a finding that may be premature due to the low specificity of the HI test. No evidence of SIN neu- tralizing antibodies was found among humans.28 Other stud- ies by the group found neutralizing antibodies to JE virus among dogs (84%), ducks (19%), wild birds (18%), and wild bats (2%);29 to SIN virus among chickens (56%);28 and to TMU virus among chickens (72%).28 Studies conducted by other groups have also shown the presence of antibodies to 313ARBOVIRUS TRANSMISSION AMONG BORNEAN ORANGUTANS TABLE 4 Seroprevalence to alphaviruses Chikungunya and Sindbis and to a bunyavirus, Batai Percent and number positive to Chikungunya Sindbis Batai Orangutans Wild Semi-captive 0% 0% 0/40 0/31 10% 0% 4/40 0/31 0% 0% 0/40 0/31 Humans Native Bornean Migrants Total 0% 28% 13% 0/31 23/82 23/184 0% 0% 2% 0/31 0/81 4/183 3% 0% 1% 1/31 0/83 1/185 TABLE 5 Seroprevalence in different age classes for all orangutans combined Age class Percent and number positive to Dengue-2 Japanese encephalitis Zika Tembusu Langat Sindbis Adult Sub-adult Juvenile Infant Total 39% 17% 23% 0% 30% 13/33 1/6 7/31 0/1 21/71 48% 33% 6% 0% 28% 16/33 2/6 2/31 0/1 20/71 15% 17% 0% 0% 8% 5/33 1/6 0/31 0/1 6/71 3% 17% 0% 0% 3% 1/32 1/6 0/29 0/1 2/68 3% 0% 0% 0% 1% 1/30 0/6 0/31 0/1 1/68 12% 0% 0% 0% 6% 4/33 0/6 0/31 0/1 4/71 Zika (18%)1 and CHIK (14%)24 viruses among humans else- where in Borneo. Of the five flaviviruses examined in the present study, wild orangutans were infected with DEN, JE, Zika, and TMU viruses. Semi-captive orangutans were infected with each of these four viruses as well as LAN, a tick-borne fla- vivirus. Both DEN and Zika viruses have been previously shown to have sylvatic cycles and infect wild nonhuman primates. Research on DEN virus has shown sylvatic cycles that infect wild nonhuman primates both in Africa13 and mainland Southeast Asia.12 For Zika virus, infection of wild nonhuman primates has been shown in Africa;15 the presence of antibody to Zika virus among Asian nonhuman primates has not previously been examined. Nonhuman primates in continental Southeast Asia have also been shown to have neutralizing antibodies to JE virus.30 There has been limited research on the forest ecology of either LAN or TMU vi- ruses. The present study shows that wild orangutans may be in- fected with DEN, JE, and Zika viruses and strongly suggests the presence of sylvatic transmission of DEN and JE viruses in forests in Borneo. The wild orangutans studied were free- ranging individuals living in forest regions within their nat- ural geographic range. While it is possible that wild orang- utans were infected through exposure to mosquitoes fed on domestic animals, or viremic agricultural or timber workers, it is unlikely. North Borneo has a low human population density and forests in the study were surrounded by oil palm plantations and not near human settlements. While the re- sults of the present study strongly suggest current evidence of sylvatic transmission of DEN and JE viruses in North Borneo, they cannot distinguish between long-term biohis- torical presence of sylvatic cycles versus more recent human introduction of viruses into sylvatic cycles. Only one wild and one semi-captive orangutan showed evidence of infec- tion with TMU virus and only one semi-captive individual had neutralizing antibodies to LAN virus. While it is difficult to form conclusions for TMU and LAN viruses based on three seropositive animals, it is interesting to note that semi- captive individuals spend considerably more time in a ter- restrial habitat, perhaps making them more likely to be in- fected with a tick-borne virus such as LAN. Humans were also infected with all five flaviviruses ex- amined in this study, although native-born Borneans showed no evidence of infection with LAN virus. Migrants were more frequently infected with DEN virus than native Bor- neans. The present study only examined neutralizing anti- body to DEN-2 virus, so a more detailed study using mul- tiple dengue strains might help to determine if dengue among native-born Borneans results from exposure to re- cently arrived migrants or from locally present sylvatic strains. People were more frequently infected with Zika virus than orangutans. A greater infection rate of humans with Zika virus indicates the possibility that Zika virus among orangutans may result from incidental infection through con- tact with mosquitoes infected by viremic humans or from recently established sylvatic cycles. Another possibility is that sylvatic Zika virus in Borneo has a more limited distri- bution or an ecology that does not lead to frequent exposure by orangutans. Of the alphaviruses and the bunyavirus examined, orang- utans were only infected with SIN virus, and then only in the wild population. Humans native-born to Borneo showed no evidence of infection with the two alphaviruses, while a number of migrants were infected with CHIK virus. The conventional wisdom is that Asian CHIK virus has a pri- marily human-mosquito transmission cycle, which periodi- cally emerges in the urban centers of Asia to cause epidem- ics.2 African CHIK virus has a known sylvatic cycle, thought by some to depend upon nonhuman primate reservoirs.16,17 The lack of antibody to CHIK virus in orangutans suggests that this virus is not enzootic in Borneo, but it is premature 314 WOLFE AND OTHERS TABLE 6 Seroprevalence in different age classes for native-born Borneans Age range (yr) Percent and number positive to Dengue-2 Japanese encephalitis Zika Tembusu Batai 21–30 31–40 �41 Total 33% 24% 60% 37% 1/3 4/17 6/10 11/30 67% 41% 30% 40% 2/3 7/17 3/10 12/30 33% 35% 20% 30% 1/3 6/17 2/10 9/30 0% 7% 0% 4% 0/3 1/14 0/8 1/25 0% 0% 10% 3% 0/3 0/18 1/10 1/31 TABLE 7 Seroprevalence in different age classes for migrants to Borneo Age range (yr) Percent and number positive to Dengue-2 Japanese encephalitis Zika Tembusu Langat Chikungunya 10–20 21–30 31–40 �41 Total 64% 77% 71% 86% 74% 9/14 27/35 17/24 6/7 59/80 21% 36% 19% 43% 29% 3/14 13/36 5/26 3/7 24/83 14% 49% 60% 86% 49% 2/14 17/35 15/25 6/7 40/81 0% 6% 5% 0% 4% 0/14 2/32 1/21 0/6 3/73 0% 0% 4% 0% 1% 0/14 0/36 1/26 0/7 1/83 12% 36% 32% 0% 26% 3/25 13/36 8/25 0/7 24/93 to draw such a conclusion for all of Asia based on the ex- amination of a single Asian primate species. The SIN virus infections among wild orangutans is the first evidence of natural nonhuman primate infection with this virus. While SIN virus is thought to be maintained primarily by birds, the presence of monotypic responses to this virus in four wild orangutans shows that nonhuman primates can be infected in natural settings. Since orangutans are primarily arboreal and Borneo has a diverse arboreal avian fauna, vector me- diated transmission from birds to orangutans seems to be the most likely explanation for this finding. For BAT virus, only a single native-born human Bornean was infected. While the relationship of BAT virus to an earlier Bunyamwera-group virus isolated from mosquitoes in Sarawak27 remains unclear, the current result suggests that BAT virus or a closely related Bunyamwera-group virus may occasionally be transmitted to humans in Borneo. The extent to which orangutans play a role in the main- tenance of sylvatic cycles of arboviruses remains unknown. Wild orangutans have a population density of approximately two individuals/km2. Due to this very low population den- sity, it is unlikely that orangutans play a necessary role in the sylvatic cycles of arboviruses. In the case of JE virus, domestic pigs and wild Ardeid birds are the primary suspects for virus maintenance, although snakes and bats may play a role.3 A wild bearded pig (Sus barbatus)31 and a diverse group of wild Ardeid birds32 inhabit lowland forest in Bor- neo, and they may play a role in maintaining and/or ampli- fying sylvatic JE virus. While sylvatic DEN virus is thought to be maintained primarily by nonhuman primates, the ex- istence of 12 species of forest-dwelling nonhuman primates in Borneo31 makes results from a single host species insuf- ficient for identification of a maintenance host. One possi- bility, rarely discussed, is that arboviruses in sylvatic cycles may be maintained by a broad assemblage of host species. An arbovirus with a broad host-range might have selective advantages over one capable of causing productive viremia in only a single host species. Intergroup competition and territoriality in tropical forests often leads to the presence of groups of overlapping, or sympatric, host species. General- izing to a broader assembly of hosts may increase the prob- ability of secondary infections in a region of low host den- sities. A study on a range of intestinal parasites among groups of wild primates in the Kibale Forest in Uganda in- dicated that the presence of intestinal parasites was best pre- dicted by membership in local multi-species primate groups and was not well predicted by host species.33 As a number of arboviruses, including DEN virus, are known to have the capacity for trans-ovarial or vertical transmission from in- fected female mosquitos to their offspring, transmission may also play a role in viral maintenance in regions with low host densities.34 Further research will be necessary to assess the importance of individual host species compared to mul- tiple-host assemblages in the sylvatic maintenance of arbo- viruses. The public health implications of the presence of sylvatic cycles remains complex. Most discussion of sylvatic cycles focuses on their negative implications. Tropical lowland for- ests, as regions of exceptionally high plant and animal bio- diversity, are likely to house high levels of microorganism biodiversity and large numbers of unknown hazardous path- ogens capable of infecting humans. Identification of these pathogens in forests may assist in the identification of un- diagnosed illness, as in the case of the Kyasanur Forest dis- ease virus,18 as well as predict potential emergence of novel pathogens or localized epidemics, such as yellow fever.11 While rarely emphasized, the presence of sylvatic cycles may also have positive health consequences, as illustrated by the well-studied case of dengue. It has long been sug- gested that sylvatic cycles of dengue and their associated human infections are less virulent than those resulting from primarily human-oriented transmission. Studies of dengue-1 and dengue-2 virus molecular evolution35 suggest that syl- vatic strains of dengue are genetically distinct and have de- creased potential for transmission and/or virulence. The high endemicity of dengue in Asia may also help to explain the lack of yellow fever in Asia.11 The presence of antibodies to dengue virus among wild animals may have led to cross- 315ARBOVIRUS TRANSMISSION AMONG BORNEAN ORANGUTANS FIGURE 1.

As endangered primates, and one of our closest living rel- atives, orangutans and their habitat have become a conser- vation priority. The study of the infectious diseases of wild primate populations has the potential to assist wildlife con- servation.36 Arboviral infection can play an important role in the mortality and morbidity of wild primate populations. Yellow fever introduction on Barro Colorado Island led to the death of a number of mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta villosa) and the Kyasanur Forest virus was responsible for the deaths of macaques and leaf monkeys as cited earlier. While earlier arbovirus research involved the hunting of wild primates, the increasingly vulnerable and endangered status of nonhuman primate populations worldwide makes this method untenable. Nevertheless, particularly in concert with conservation efforts, there are occasional opportunities to sample from wild primates in a way that improves the un- derstanding of pathogen ecology while complementing ani- mal conservation goals.

Introduction In April 2010, an outbreak of shelduck infectious disease, of unknown origin, caused death, retarded growth, high fever, loss of appetite, and egg production decline. The outbreak was first detected in Shanghai, China, but spread rapidly to all of the south–east provinces of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Anhui. The disease continued to transmit until winter, and the shelducks in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were under a huge threat by this unknown pathogen. Epizootic investigation suggested that most susceptible animals to this pathogen were shelducks, since infection of muscovy ducks and chickens was not reported. The infection rate andmorbidity of shelducks was as high as 100% and mortality varied from 5% to 30% possibly due to secondary bacterial infections. Postmortem examinations were performed and revealed grossly swollen spleens and kidneys. To date, more than 10 million shelducks have been infected and approximately one mil- lion have died. We isolated a causative agent from sick shelducks by inoculating filtered spleen homogenates into the allantoic sacs of embryonated chicken eggs. Here, we describe the properties of the causative agent of this outbreak. Results Isolation of the causative agent in SPF embryonated chicken eggs Since various antibiotics were used to mitigate the outbreak in ducks without any success, the pathogenwas thought to be a virus. To isolate the causative agent, a homogenate of the spleens of sick shelducks was filtered through 0.22 um filters and inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. All of the embryos of the inoculated eggs died 2–6 days post-inoculation and were severely swollen with edema (Fig. 1). The supernatant of the homogenate of the embryos had an infectivity titer of 105.5 ELD50/mL. Electron microscopy The purified causative agent was examined by electron microscopy.

Physicochemical properties of the isolate To test whether the virus was covered with an organic solvent- labile lipid envelope, FX2010 was treated with either ether or chloroform. FX2010 lost infectivity after treatmentwith either organic solvents, indicating that it is an enveloped virus. To define the nucleic acid type of FX2010, RNA and DNA were extracted from purified FX2010 and subjected to agarose electropho- Nucleotide Substitutions (x100) 32.5 51015202530 Ilheu Rocio virus Fig. 3. Phylogenetic tree for the NS5 gene of the Tembusu virus FX2010. The phylogenetic tree alignment algorithm. The length of the branches represents the distance between sequence resis. No specific DNA band was found on the gel, while a specific RNA band was detected (data not shown). Upon treatment of the nucleic acid extracted from FX2010 with RNase but not DNase, the RNA band was no longer detected. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis An FX2010 cDNA library was made and 100 plasmids extracted from the bacterial clones picked randomly from the cDNA librarywere directly sequenced. One-third of the sequences of the inserted nucleotides shared 40%–80% identity with viruses of the flavivirus family when analyzed by using BLAST at the NCBI. The remaining sequences showed high identity with the rRNAs or mRNAs of Gallus gallus. Sequences with high homology to other virus genera were not found. The complete E gene (1–1497 nucleotides)(GenBank accession number HQ833330)and a partial sequence (1022 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus) of the NS5 gene (GenBank accession number HQ833331) of FX2010 were determined when the library sequences were compiled and analyzed by using the SEQMAN program. To understand the taxonomic relationship of FX2010, the sequences of the E gene, from nucleotide positions 318 to 1266 and the 1022 nucleotide segment of the NS5 gene were compared with those of representative flavivirus obtained from GenBank. The nucleotide sequences of the E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 were highly similar to those of BYD virus (sharing 99.6% and 99.7% nucleotide identities, respectively); BYD virus was isolated from ducks with egg-drop syndrome in China (Su et al.). The E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 88.3% and 88.0% nucleotide homology with those of the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain, respectively. Accordingly, the amino acid sequence of the E protein and the NS5 protein of FX2010 proved to be 97.2% and 98.8% identical to those of the MM1775 strain, respectively. When compared with other viruses in the Nyata group, to which Tembusu virus belongs, of genus Flavivirus, the NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 69.6%, 75.1%, 76%, 71.2%, and 76.8% nucleotide identity with that of Rocio virus, Ntaya virus, Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, Ilheus virus, and Bagaza virus, respectively (Fig. 3). The NS5 protein that corresponded to the 1022 nucleotide sequence from the 3′ terminus of FX2010 shared 78.2%–88.8% amino acid homology with that of these viruses. Since the flavivirus isolates with N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998), we designated this virus Tembusu virus Fengxian 2010 (FX2010) after the name of the virus species, the district from which it came, and the time when it was isolated. 0 Tembusu virus Sitiawan Tembusu virus strain MM1775 Tembusu virus FX2010 Baiyangdian virus Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus Bagaza virus Ntaya virus s virus was constructed by use of theMEGALIGN program (DNASTAR) and by using the Clustal pairs.

A protein expression plasmid, pCAGGS-E possessing this partial E gene under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter, was generated. BALB/c mice were injected intramuscularly with this protein expression plasmid every two weeks. Three weeks after the third injection, the serum of the immunized mice was collected for cross- neutralization assays. 3P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Cross-neutralization assays In cross serum neutralization tests between FX2010 and JEV, we found weak to no cross-reactivity with heterologous antibodies; an antiserum against FX2010 neutralized its homologous virus at a serum dilution of 1:1580 (Table 1). In cross serum neutralizing tests between FX2010 and Tembusu virus, an antiserum against the partial E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010 at a serum dilution of 1:90.

Upon three further passages of the virus in duck embryo fibroblasts, CPEs became apparent. Pathogenicity in ducks Birds were thought to be the natural hosts of flaviviruses, and only a limited number of flaviviruses were reported previously to cause disease or death in ducks. We, therefore, infected six shelducks by inoculating them i.n. or i.m. with 0.2 mL of supernatant of homoge- nates of embryos containing 105 ELD50 of FX2010. One day after the ducks were inoculated, we introduced three naïve ducks to the isolator in which the i.n.-infected ducks were housed. Both the i.n. and i.m. inoculated ducks lost their appetite on day 3 post-infection, and the contact ducks showed symptoms similar to those of the infected animals on day 5 post-contact. Upon dissection of the inoculated ducks on day 4 post-infection and of the contact ducks on day 6 post- exposure to the infected ducks, all of the ducks showed grossly swollen spleens and kidneys.

Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Histopathological studies showed that all of the ducks tested had systemic lesions: moderate necrosis in the brain, severe nephrosis, pneumorrhagia, and severe necrosis of the spleen. To detect the specific viral antigen of FX2010 in organs, tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with an antiserum against FX2010. Virus antigens were found in the brain, kidney, lung, and spleen (Fig. 4), indicating systemic infection of FX2010; no antigen was detected in the tissues of uninfected ducks. Upon viral titration in organs, high levels of virus were detected in the trachea, spleen, pancreas, kidney, brain, lung, livers, and blood of the inoculated and contact ducks (Table 2). The results show that the virus could transmit efficiently and directly to contact animals without mosquito. To determine the mortality rate in a larger cohort of ducks, a total of eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with 105 ELD50 of FX2010 in 0.2 mL. Of these, three ducks died on day 7, day 10, and day 11 post-infection, yielding a mortality rate of 7.5%. None of the forty ducks in the negative control group died during the experiment. All of the remaining ducks that were inoculated with FX2010 seroconverted. Discussion Tembusu virus (TMUV), a member of the Ntaya virus (NTAV) group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, has been frequently isolated from Culex and Aedes mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand (Gubler et al., 2007). Although birds, including domestic fowl, are thought to be the natural vertebrate hosts of Flavivirus (Hoshino et al., 2009; Lindh et al., 2008), a few infectious diseases of poultry caused by these viruses have been recorded (Ianconescu et al., 1975). Sitiawan virus, which was isolated from sick chicken and transmitted by Culex mosquitoes in Malaysia was one of the first Tembusu virus strains reported to cause disease in domestic poultry (Kono et al., 2000). Recently, Su et al. (2011) reported that a new Tembusu-related flavivirus, BYD virus, caused duck egg-drop syn- drome in China. The E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 have 99.6% and 99.7% nucleotide identities with those of BYD virus, respectively, suggesting that the FX2010 and BYD viruses are essentially the same virus. The E and NS5 genes of the FX2010 and BYD viruses share about 88% nucleotide homology and 97% amino acid homologywith those of Tembusu virus. Cross-neutralization studies with the reference Tembusu virus would further support an antigenic relationship between FX2010 and other Tembusu viruses. However, we could not obtain a permit from the Chinese government to import the reference Tembusu virus, because it does not exist in China. However, we found that the antiserum to the partial E protein (aa 107-422) of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010, whereas antise- rum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not. These results suggest a close antigenic relationship between FX2010 and Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain. Recently, classification of adenoviruses based on C C1 C2 Fig. 4 (continued). 5P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 sequences, not serology, was suggested and debated widely (Aoki et al., 2011; Imperiale and Enquist, 2011; Seto et al., 2011). For flavivirus, isolateswith N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998). Therefore, FX2010 and BYD virus represent a new strain of Tembusu virus because the former viruses share about 88.0% nucleotide homology for the NS gene with the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain. Although BYD virus was described as a new Tembusu-related flavivirus (Su et al.), we suggest that the virus be named as a Tembusu virus. A Tembusu virus has never before been detected in China. Given the limited sequence information available, it is not possible for us to speculate which of the amino acid differences may contribute to the different pathogenic properties of these viruses in ducks. Only a limited number of flaviviruses have been reported to cause duck infectious diseases (Wojnarowicz et al., 2007), although many flaviviruses, whose pathogenicity for animals is unknown, have been isolated from mosquitoes, ticks, and bats (Cook et al., 2009; Crabtree et al., 2009; Ebel, 2009; Epstein et al., 2010; Hoshino et al., 2009; Huhtamo et al., 2009; Junglen et al., 2009; Morales-Betoulle et al., 2008; Platt et al., 1975; Roiz et al., 2009; Saiyasombat et al., 2010). Tembusu virus was isolated frommosquitoes in Kuala Lumpur in 1955 (Kono et al., 2000). Since then, Tembusu virus has been isolated from the Culex species of mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand. Encephalitis and retarded growth of chicks caused by a Tembusu virus was firstly reported in Malaysia (Kono et al., 2000). In addition, high levels of serum-neutralizing antibody against Tembusu virus have been reported in humans in Malaysia, although a disease associated with Tembusu virus infection had not yet been reported (Kono et al., 2000). It remains unknown whether FX2010-like Tembusu virus can infect humans, although the virus has spread widely in Southeast China. However, given that the areas where FX2010-like Tembusu virus is circulating are among the most densely populated areas in the world, this virus may pose a threat to human health in the future. We recommend that human serological surveillance be conducted in FX2010-likeTembusu virus -circulating areas as soon as possible. Materials and methods Field samples In a shelduck layer farm in the Fengxian district of Shanghai, China, an outbreak of a disease characterized by retarded growth, egg production decline, and 10% mortality was observed in 9–26-week- old ducks. Postmortem examinations were performed on the dead ducks. Tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin; 3-um sections were stain with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic diagnosis. Virus isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs The homogenated spleens of dead shelducks were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), filtered through 0.22 um filters and inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (0.1 mL per egg). Embryos and the chorio- allantoic membranes of the eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation were pooled, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use for virologic and molecular analyses. Virus purification The above-described supernatant of homogenated embryos and chorio-allantoicmembraneswas subjected toultra-speed centrifugation; D D1 D2 Fig. 4 (continued). 6 P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 the pellet was resuspended in PBS, loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient of 30%, 45%, and 60% (W/V), and centrifuged for 2 h at 35,000 rpm. The fraction between the 30% and 45% sucrose gradient was collected and ultra-centrifuged; the pellet was resuspended in PBS. Electron microscopy Purified virus was negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid and observed under a JEM2100 transmission electron microscope. Table 2 Replication of FX2010 in ducks.

For chloroform treatment, 2 mL of FX2010 virus stock was mixed with 0.1 mL of chloroform and placed at 4 °C for 20 min. The organic layers were discarded, and air was bubbled through both mixtures for 2 min to remove residual organic solvents. Viabilitywas tested by inoculating the aqueousphaseof the chloroform- or ether-treated virus into eggs (Miller and Lipman, 1973).

Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Nucleic acid extraction and identification Nucleic acid was extracted from purified virus by using the QIAamp Viral RNAMini Kit (QIAGEN Inc. Valencia, CA, US) or the Viral DNA Extraction Kit (ABigen Inc, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the nucleic acid type, extracted nucleic acid was treated with RNase and DNase (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Construction of a cDNA library of viral genes Viral cDNAs were synthesized by using a cDNA Library Construc- tion Kit (Takara), which includes the following steps: first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA synthesis, adaptor ligation, restriction enzyme treatment, vector ligation, and competent Jm109 cell transformation. Bacterial clones were picked at random for sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Plasmids extracted from the bacterial clones picked from the cDNA library were directly sequenced by use of the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Foster, CA, USA) and an ABI 3500 genetic analyzer. To compile and analyze the sequences, we used the SEQMAN program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The sequences of the reference viruses were obtained from GenBank by using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Informa- tion (NCBI) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The nucleotide sequences were compared and phylogenetic trees were generated with the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR) by using the Clustal alignment algorithm. The sequences of the following reference viruses were included in the phylogenetic analysis: Baiyangdian (BYD) virus, JF312912; Tembusu virus strain MM1775, AF013408.1; Tembusu virus Sitiawan, AB110489.1; Rocio virus, AF013397.1; Ntaya virus, AF013392. 1; Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, AF013377.1; Ilheus virus, AF013376.1; and Bagaza virus, AF013363.1. Cross-neutralization assays Antisera against the FX2010 virus were collected from ducks 21 days after i.m. inoculation with 105 ELD50 of FX2010. The antiserum to JEV was from a pig infected with JEV, strain SA-1414-2 (provided by Shanghai Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shang- hai, PRC). Because Tembusu virus and antiserum to it were not available in our laboratory, a portion of the E gene encoding amino acids 107 to 422 with artificial start and stop codons was synthesized based on the sequence in GenBank (AB110494.1). A protein expression plasmid, pCAGGS-E, possessing this partial E gene under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter was generated. BALB/c mice were injected i.m. with this protein expression plasmid every two weeks. Three weeks after the third injection, the serum of the immunized mice was collected for cross-neutralization assays. The viruses used in the cross-neutralization assays were FX2010 (second passage in embryonated chicken eggs) and JEV (provided by Shanghai Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shanghai, PRC). Serial ten-fold dilutions starting from a 1:5 dilution of the heat-inactivated antisera were mixed with 100 TCID50 of JEV or 100 ELD50 of FX2010 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture containing JEV was then inoculated into BHK cells, and the mixture containing FX2010 was inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For the neutralization assays with JEV, the results were read when cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in control cultures (no antiserum) and the serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited CPEs. For the neutralization assays with FX2010, the serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited egg embryo death 6 days post-inoculation. Virus replication in cell cultures African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and duck embryo fibroblast cultures were used for virus replication. These cells were grown in 75 mm flasks and then infected with 100 ELD50 of FX2010 in 1 mL of PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions of viral samples (0.1 mL) were inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Three eggs were used for each dilution. The eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation were considered virus-positive; the 50% egg lethal dose (ELD50) was calculated by using Reed and Muench's method. To detect CPEs, FX2010 was passaged five times in duck embryo fibroblasts. Duck experiments To determine the pathogenicity of the virus isolate, six 9-week-old ducks (a local outbred strain of shelducks) were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 50% lethal doses for eggs (ELD50) of virus in 0.2 mL of supernatant of homogenized embryos and chorio-allantoic membranes of eggs that died 24–120 h post-inocula- tion with FX2010 and housed separately in two isolators. One day after inoculation, to test the transmissibility of the virus, three contact ducks were introduced into the isolator in which the ducks that had been inoculated i.n. were housed. Three virus-inoculated ducks in each group and three uninfected control ducks were euthanized on day 4. Six days after being co-housedwith the virus-inoculated ducks, the three contact ducks were euthanized. Samples of lung, trachea, kidney, brain, liver, pancreas, spleen, and blood were collected and virus titers were determined by using 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For histopathological study, samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Alternatively, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted with an antiserumagainst the virus isolate. The three remainingducks thatwere inoculated i.n. or i.mwere observed daily for 10 days for signs of disease. To determine the mortality rate of ducks infected with FX2010, eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with 0.2 mL of 105 ELD50 of FX2010 virus, and another forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with the same volume of PBS. The two groups of ducks were housed separately in different rooms and were observed daily for 20 days for signs of disease, and the number of duck deaths was recorded. Acknowledgments We thank Drs.
