Ulrich,3 and Matthias Niedrig1 Abstract Introduction: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes one of the most important flavivirus infections of the central nervous system, affecting humans in Europe and Asia. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation. Method: To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)– quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas. Results: In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas. TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated. Discussion and Conclusion: The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation. Key Words: Distribution—Monitoring—Rodents—Tick-borne encephalitis—Zoonosis. Introduction Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most im-portant flaviviral human diseases in Europe and Asia. The causative agent TBE virus (TBEV) has a positive single- stranded RNA genome of about 11 kilobases and is a member of the tick-borne flavivirus group (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) (Grard et al. 2007, Mansfield et al. 2009). TBEV is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick or, rarely, through nonpasteurized milk products from infected mam- mals (Holzmann et al. 2009). The main vectors of TBEV are ticks of the genus Ixodes: Ixodes persulcatus in Asia and eastern 1Center for Biological Security (ZBS-1), Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany. 2Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, University of South Bohemia, Ceské Budejovice, Czech Republic. 3Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany. 4Landesforstanstalt Eberswalde, Eberswalde, Germany. 5Department of Virology, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany. 6Amt für Landwirtschaft, Flurneuordnung und Forsten Mitte, Außenstelle Wanzleben, Wanzleben, Germany. 7Wildlife Biology and Game Management Team, Department of Forest Zoology and Forest Conservation, Büsgen-Institute, Georg-August- University Göttingen Büsgenweg 3, Göttingen, Germany. *These two authors equally contributed to this work. {Present address: Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany.

During the lifecycle of a tick, TBEV can be transmitted transstadially, transovarially, or primarily from infected ticks to other ticks while cofeeding on the same rodent host (Pfeffer and Dobler 2010). The virus circulates between vector ticks and some of their hosts, mostly deer and small mammals such as rodents and insectivores, whereas only small mammals are presumed to be competent virus reservoir hosts (Mansfield et al. 2009). Larger mammals, such as sheep, cattle, or humans, are accidental hosts, as they develop only a short viremia with low viral titers or no detectable viremia. As a consequence, they are not competent to transmit and spread the virus (Pfeffer and Dobler 2010). In recent years, the incidence of diagnosed TBE cases has increased throughout Europe. In addition, TBEV infections emerged in new areas, for example, southern Sweden, Den- mark, and France, possibly because of socioeconomic or cli- mate changes (Haglund 2002, Bröker and Gniel 2003, Donoso Mantke et al. 2008, Sumilo et al. 2008, Fomsgaard et al. 2009). In Germany, most of the human TBE cases are reported to occur in the southern federal states. Therefore, certain parts of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hesse have been classi- fied as risk areas for TBE (Fig. 1). These risk areas are defined by the incidence of human cases (RKI 2009, 2010). This method of classification might be misleading because of in- creasing vaccination rates in humans, particularly in risk ar- eas, and a resulting decrease in the number of human TBE cases. Additionally, the exposure of humans to ticks might vary substantially in space and time and might thus also in- troduce bias to the current risk-mapping approach (Kiffner et al. 2010). Further, humans are accidental hosts rarely be- coming infected, and quite often an infection will not be rec- ognized because of unspecific symptoms, mild courses of disease, or unawareness of physicians.

Ticks that have frequently been used in prevalence studies are not suitable for TBEV monitoring because infection rates vary greatly between local tick populations. Infections rates are usu- ally below 1% even in highly endemic areas, for example, 0.23% and 0.46% in recent studies from Germany and Switzerland, respectively, implying high costs for collecting and screening (Süss et al. 2004, Gaumann et al. 2010, Kup�ca et al. 2010). Alternatively, terrestrial mammals could be used for TBEV monitoring and the definition of risk areas, as virus or virus- specific antibodies have been detected in nearly all species studied so far (Radda 1973, Wurm et al. 2000, Mandl 2005, Mansfield et al. 2009). In line with these findings, TBEV prev- alence investigations by detecting TBEV-specific antibodies in game animals such as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cattle, and goats) revealed reliable information (Radda et al. 1968, Wurm et al. 2000, Klimes et al. 2001, Juceviciene et al. 2005, Lindhe et al. 2009, Sikutova et al. 2009). However, because of their large activity range as well as a lifespan of several years, the exact time and site of an infection cannot be determined. In contrast, TBE risk analysis based on prevalence studies in small mammals, such as rodents, has advantages. They are widespread in most ecological systems, have a small home range, are easy to trap and monitor, and are heavily parasit- ized by ticks, which probably results in higher TBE virus prevalence (and thus lower associated costs) than in ticks. Once infected with TBEV, they are supposed to develop a persistent infection (Ernek et al. 1963, Kozuch et al. 1963, Nuttall et al. 1994, Danielova et al. 2002, Süss 2003, Bakhva- lova et al. 2006, Gray et al. 2009, Kiffner et al. 2011). Therefore, in this study, we chose rodents as potential sentinels for distribution analysis studies of TBEV. First, lab- oratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally in- fected with TBEV, and selected organs and blood were analyzed for viral RNA and, in part, for virus particles over a period of 100 days postinfection (dpi). The results obtained should provide new information about replication, persis- tence, and organ tropism of TBEV in wild rodents. To assess the suitability of rodents as sentinels for virus spread in nature, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with emerging autochthonous TBE cases, was determined by real-time (RT)–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR). The prevalence was compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas. Materials and Methods Experimental infection of M. arvalis voles and organ sampling Twelve female, adult, outbred M. arvalis voles obtained from the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Uni- versity of South Bohemia, Czech Republic, which underwent several generations under specific-pathogen-free conditions, were infected by subcutaneous inoculation of 1000 plaque forming units of TBEV strain Hypr (GenBank accession number: U39292.1) isolated by Pospisil et al. (1954). At 5, 20, 50, and 100 dpi, two or three animals were killed and dis- sected. Organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney) and blood samples were frozen immediately at - 80�C for later RNA extraction and virus cultivation. Collecting and preparation of samples from rodents Four hundred forty-one wild-living rodents were collected in different federal states of Germany (Fig. 1) between 2002 and 2008 and necropsied according to standard protocols established by the network ‘‘Rodent-borne pathogens’’ (Ul- rich et al. 2008). Briefly, the collected rodents were frozen and stored until necropsy. After identifying the species, weight, size, and sex were determined. During necropsy, spleen and brain tissue for TBEV analysis and additional tissues were taken and stored at - 80�C until further analysis. The species affiliation of TBEV-positive rodents was confirmed by a PCR- based cytochrome b analysis. Isolation of viral nucleic acids Total RNA preparations from whole blood and cell culture supernatant samples were obtained using the peqGOLD blood RNA kit (PeqLab Biotechnology GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) and the Qiagen viral extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Tis- sue samples were first homogenized with Fast-Prep FP120 (eu- bio, Vienna, Austria). Afterward, RNA was extracted according to the protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). Virus detection by RT-qRT-PCR and sequencing To obtain cDNA, 5 lL of the RNA preparation was reverse- transcribed in a 20 lL final reaction volume by Superscript II kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Initially, the RNA was incubated for 10 min at 65�C. The reverse transcription was performed at 37�C for 60 min and at 93�C for 10 min in a Biometra thermoblock cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). cDNA was tested by a TBEV-specific RT-qPCR as previously described (Achazi et al. 2011). Sequencing of TBEV-positive PCR samples was performed using the BigDye� Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus isolation and cultivation Tissue samples were homogenized in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and the homogenate was clarified by cen- trifugation. The obtained supernatant was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586). Cell culture supernatant was harvested at 4 days after inoculation for later RNA extraction. To assess the presence of viable virus in the sample, the in- oculated cell culture was maintained through sequential blind passages over a period of 6 weeks. Detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin G antibodies The detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was done by an immunofluorescence assay from EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the following changes: as secondary antibody, we used the FITC-conjugated goat anti- mouse IgG antibody A90-216F from Bethyl (Montgomery, TX). Samples were diluted 1:10 and 1:100. Statistical analysis Laboratory data were handled and analyzed using PASW Statistics 17 (version 17.0.3; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 643 Results As, at present, the knowledge on TBEV replication, persis- tence, and organ tropism in rodent reservoirs is poor, 11 lab- oratory-bred M. arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV. Selected organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and blood) were taken at four different days over a period of 100 dpi and analyzed by RT-qPCR and, in part, by a virus isolation approach (Table 1). Throughout the whole period of investi- gation, no obvious clinical signs of infection were observed in any of the animals. Beginning at 5 dpi, TBEV genome was found in several organs, that is, brain, spleen, and liver, and at 50 dpi, all organs investigated were found to be RT-qPCR positive (in at least one animal). At the final day of investiga- tion, all three animals were found to be TBEV RNA positive in at least one tissue. Mean copy numbers of the different organs and on different dpi ranged from 4 · 100 to 3 · 106 genome copies per mg organ or mL blood (Table 1). In the TBEV RNA- positive animals, the highest copy numbers were found in the brain at 5 and 20 dpi, but the initial copy number in the brain of > 106 at 5 dpi decreased over time to 101 at 100 dpi. Blood taken at 5 and 50 dpi (of one animal each) was found positive for TBEV genome by RT-qPCR, indicating a viremia in these two animals on these days. In contrast, all blood samples from the three animals at 100 dpi were negative (Table 1). In the control animal, TBEV-specific RNA was not detectable in brain, spleen, kidney, or blood. The persistence of infectious TBEV was confirmed by virus cultivation and subsequent RT-qPCR on cell culture super- natants for three RT-qPCR–positive tissue samples, that is, brain samples from animals at 5 and 100 dpi and a liver sample at 100 dpi (Table 1). The samples were chosen because of their high viral load as well as to prove whether viable virus could be recovered from tissue samples at 100 dpi. A typical cytopathic effect was detected for all the brain tissue–inocu- lated cell cultures at 5 and 8 dpi. In contrast, virus isolation from the liver samples was successful only after two cell passages and an observational period of 28 days until cyto- pathic effect occurred and the supernatant could be tested positive for TBEV genome (Table 1). A clear titer of TBEV-specific IgG antibodies of > 1:10 could be detected in all samples from 5 dpi on over the whole period of investigation. No specific TBEV-IgG antibodies were de- tected in the control animal. To check the suitability of wild-living rodents as sentinels for the spread of TBEV, the prevalence of TBEV was deter- mined in spleen or brain samples from 259 rodents trapped in Brandenburg. This prevalence was compared with that in 137 samples from rodents trapped in TBE risk areas in southern Germany (Hesse) as well as with that in 45 samples from rodents trapped in TBE nonrisk areas in northern and western Germany (Fig. 1). In 45 of 441 (10%) rodents, TBEV RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in brain or spleen. The infection rates varied be- tween 0% and 20% among the 13 trapping sites (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The average TBEV prevalence in TBE risk areas was about 15%. A statistically significant lower infection rate of Table 1.

Sequencing of amplification products was performed, but because of low copy numbers (mean copy number of rodent spleen and brain samples tested positive on TBEV genome by RT-qPCR = 67 copies per mg organ) and the short size of the PCR fragment, the obtained sequence data were of poor quality, so no subsequent subtyping and phylogenetic anal- ysis were possible (data not shown). TBEV genome was detected in rodents of six species, that is, Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvati- cus, Microtus agrestis, M. arvalis, and Myodes glareolus (Table 3). Infection rates in these species ranged from 7% to 29%. No viral RNA could be detected in Mus musculus samples, most likely because of a small sample size (n = 2). Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference (v2 test) in the infection rates of the different species. Interestingly, in the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg, TBEV RNA was detected in five rodent species, with the highest infection rates found in M. glareolus (11%, 8/73), M. arvalis (11%, 2/19), and A. agrarius (11%, 2/19). In the high-risk regions of Hesse and in the nonrisk area of Saxony-Anhalt, three of four investigated rodent species were found to be RT-qPCR positive, with the highest rates in M. glareolus of 18% (11/63) and 9% (2/22), respectively. Remarkably, A. flavicollis showed a higher in- fection rate in Hesse (13%, 9/69) than in Brandenburg (2%, 1/50). Also, there was no statistically significant difference (v2 test) in the infection rates of male (11%, 24/216) versus female (8%, 17/207) rodents or in the body mass of animals found positive or negative for TBEV, respectively. Discussion The results of the experimental TBEV infectivity study in- dicate a persistent infection in M. arvalis. Obvious clinical signs of disease were absent despite high virus titers in the brain. At 5 and 50 dpi, virus was detectable in blood, dem- onstrating a long duration of viremia in some individuals. However, the lack of detection of viral RNA in blood samples drawn at 20 and 100 dpi may suggest an oscillation of the viral load in blood. This assumption might be in line with the previously reported short-term viremia found in other mammalian (including human) hosts (Ernek et al. 1963, Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981, Schultze et al. 2007, Holzmann et al. 2009). The oscillation and vari- ability in the process of infection in individual voles could be attributed to the variable genetic background of the outbred animals. Experimental TBEV infections in conventional in- bred laboratory M. musculus–derived lines, such as Swiss Albino or BALB/c mice, had a lethal outcome within 1–3 weeks as these mice suffer from a mutation in the Oas 1b gene, which is supposed to be an interferon-induced effector gene (Lindenbach and Rice 2001, Mandl 2005, Růžek et al. 2008). The presented results prove that TBEV persists for at least 3 months in different organs and for > 1 month in the blood of M. arvalis; however, virus titers decreased over time, partic- ularly in the brain. These results support former studies with other rodent species (M. glareolus and A. flavicollis) in which TBEV could be detected in blood only up to 5 dpi and in organs only up to 30 dpi by classical methods (Ernek et al. 1963, Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981). Besides the different rodent species used in these studies, the prolonged detection of TBEV RNA as well as viable virus in the present study might be related to improved cultivation techniques and the use of highly sensitive RT-qPCR diag- nostic methods. Also, anti-TBEV IgG antibodies could be detected from 5 dpi on over the whole 3 months. These results indicate a normal immune response in the infected animals. It might be interesting to analyze antibody titers over a longer period than 3 months because in a former study with rodents from Finland (Tonteri et al. 2011), antibodies could only be detected in 2 of 16 rodents whose brain tissue tested positive for Eu- ropean TBEV RNA. The findings of the experimental study and the detection of TBEV RNA in wild-living M. arvalis presented here supports a previous study by Nosek et al. (1970) proposing M. arvalis as a reservoir for TBEV. In line with these findings, related rodent species such as M. agrestis and M. glareolus were also found to contain TBEV RNA. TBEV RNA-positive M. glareolus voles were trapped not only in the TBE risk area in Hesse but also in the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Fur- ther, in all trapping sites, M. glareolus voles showed the highest infection rates. These results suggest that this species might be the most important host for TBEV in Germany. In Brandenburg, M. arvalis and A. agrarius showed similar infection rates and therefore seem to be important hosts in this federal state. In contrast, in Hesse, A. flavicollis showed the second highest infection rate of about 10% and therefore may substitute the role of A. agrarius and M. arvalis in the western parts of Germany. This is especially interesting because the geographical distribution of A. agrarius is restricted to the eastern part of Germany (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999). Because of high variation in sample size and sampling sites of species in this initial study, the significance of the observed differences in infection rates between different rodent species has to be corroborated in future large-scale screening studies. Altogether, previous investigations and our present study suggest TBEV to be rather nonreservoir specific. The reasons and mechanisms for this apparent unspecific virus–host interaction are interesting issues for further investigations (Kozuch et al. 1981). Table 3.

RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 645 The detection of TBEV RNA in rodents from four of five districts of the federal state of Brandenburg and both inves- tigated districts of Saxony-Anhalt raises questions on the definition of risk areas, as these regions have not been clas- sified as risk areas so far (RKI 2009, 2010). In future, based on the number or proportion of infected rodent specimens per area, a modified classification would be possible. Taking into account the geographical distribution of the districts (Fig. 1), it becomes evident that the trapping sites with rodents tested positive for TBEV and previously classified as TBE nonrisk areas are located in or near areas with autochthonous TBE cases (light gray). In contrast, rodents trapped in a park in the city center of Cologne (far away from TBE risk areas) are found to be free of TBEV. In Germany, the overall prevalence of TBEV-positive ro- dents averaged at 10%. Therefore, Germany seems to be a country of low TBE risk in comparison to a prevalence of 61% in rodents of a high endemic area in Siberia (Bakhvalova et al. 2006). This rating is supported by the low incidence of human TBE cases in Germany compared with other European countries, for example, the Czech Republic or Russia (Donoso Mantke et al. 2008). In general, the infection rates vary strongly among the different trapping sites. These variations are consistent with the fact that TBEV are concentrated in so-called ‘‘natural foci,’’ habitat sites limited to a few square meters or square kilo- meters (Pavlovsky 1966, Zeman 1997, Gritsun et al. 2003, Süss 2003, Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008), but could also be led back by seasonal fluctuations, which could not be considered because of missing data. This investigation provides further direct evidence of TBEV in Brandenburg (northeastern Germany) and is in line with case reports on human TBE patients in Brandenburg (Süss et al. 1996, 2008, Becker et al. 2006, RKI 2009, 2010). Further, the results demonstrate that TBEV is endemic in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, federal states that have not been previously classified as risk areas. This finding has important implications for public health policy regarding vaccination strategies, awareness training, and the definition of risk areas for TBEV. We conclude that TBEV detection in rodents represents a promising surrogate marker system for TBE, particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation. Rodents are easy to capture, show a persistent TBEV infection, and are ubiquitous in all ecological systems. Future investigations should assess the value and accuracy of this approach by parallel investigations of ticks, rodents, or other host animals in high and low TBE risk areas in Germany.

ABSTRACT: During 1988 and 1989, a serologic survey of wildlife was conducted in northeast- ern Mexico to determine the presence, preva- lence, and distribution of arboviruses and other selected disease agents. Eighty mammal speci- mens were tested. Antibodies to vesicular sto- matitis-Indiana, Venezuelan equine encephali- tis-Mena II, Rio Grande virus, and vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey were detected predomi- nately in small mammals. Deer and mouflon (Ovis musimon) had antibodies to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Two species had serologic evidence of recent exposure to Francisella tularensis. A white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) had antibodies to An- aplasma marginale. All specimens tested for an- tibodies against Yersinia pestis and Brucella abort us were negative. Sera from 315 birds were tested for antibody against five equine enceph- alitis viruses and six avian pathogens. During 1988, antibodies to Venezuelan equine enceph- alitis-Mena II, Venezuelan equine encephalitis- TC83, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine en- cephalitis, and western equine encephalitis were detected in birds of several species. Antibodies to Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease virus were also detected. Birds from five species presented antibodies to Mycoplasma meleagri- dis. Specimens tested for M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chiamydia psittaci were nega- tive. To the best of our knowledge, this survey represents the first serologic evidence of blue- tongue, Cache Valley virus, epizootic hemor- rhagic disease, Jamestown Canyon virus, vesic- ular stomatitis-Indiana, vesicular stomatitis- New Jersey, Rio Grande virus, and tularemia reported among wildlife in Mexico. Key words: Arboviruses, avian cholera, dis- ease survey, Newcastle disease, tularemia, wild- life. Much of the information known about diseases in wildlife has been aquired from serologic surveys. A number of factors, however, such as viremia titer and dura- tion, antivector behavior, and longevity may bias results. Another limitation of se- rology includes the size and distribution of the samples. Samples from a single flock or herd may be insufficient. Also, the trap- ping technique may bias the composition of the collection, resulting in a non-rep- resentative sample of wildlife tested. De- spite these limiting factors, serologic sur- veys are considered important in that they reveal evidence of the presence of disease when apparent infections and clinical cases have not been detected. Also, presence of selected disease agents may be determined when limited information is known about a specific disease in a geographic area. The prevalence of arboviruses in wild vertebrates in Mexico has been previously documented (De M ucha-Macias, 1963; Campillo-Sainz, 1969; Scherer et al., 1971; Dickerman et al., 1972b). Other disease agents have been reported from wildlife in that country. For example, Varela and Vazquez (1954) isolated Yersinia pestis from spleens of Mexican prairie dogs (Cynomys mexicanus) trapped in the State of Coahuila, demonstrating for the first time that sy!vatic plague was present in Mexico. However, we know of no serologic Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use 436 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 28, NO. 3, JULY 1992 FIGuRE 1. Study areas from which serum samples were collected from wildlife for serologic survey, Mexico 1988-89. surveys performed in wildlife in Mexico since that time. The objective of this study was to determine, through a serologic sur- vey, the presence and prevalence of ar- boviruses and other potential pathogens in resident wildlife species from northeastern Mexico. The study areas, located in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, Republic of Mexico (Fig. 1), have been previously described (Bennett et a!., 1991). Mammals and birds were captured in all study areas from 18 May to 8 August 1988 and 10 June to 11 August 1989. Capture techniques and field procedures used in this study were similar to those described by Sudia et al. (1970). Sherman traps and leghold traps for mammals were operated for not more than 3 days in the same study area and were visited once a day early in the morning. An average of 41 Sherman trap-nights and five leg-hold trap-nights were used during a 65-day period over the two summers. Carnivores and other large mammals were chemically immobilized with ketamine (Ketaset, Bristol Labora- tories, Syracuse, New York 66201, USA) at recommended dosages (Jessup, 1982). At the time of this survey, several wild-caught species were temporarily held in corrals and pens at Rancho San Francisco, Coa- huila. For the purposes of this study, a wild-caught captive animal included any mammal or bird held in captivity for a week or longer. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at ground level for a total of 560 net hours (1 net hr = one 12-m mist net operated for 1 hr of daylight) (McLean et a!., 1989). Nets were checked every 2 hr. Mist nets were set for 1 to 3 days on the study sites from 8:00 to 17:00 each day. Waterfowl and other birds species were manually captured in nesting boxes or while on ground nests (Markum and Ba!- dassarre, 1989a, b). A number of nesting black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocyg- na autumnalis) were captured by hand at night using a spotlight. Blood specimens (0.5-10 ml) were taken by venipuncture from the heart, radial, tarsal or jugular veins, allowed to clot and refrigerated overnight at 4 C. After blood specimens were centrifuged, sera were re- moved, placed in vials and frozen on dry ice. In the laboratory, serum specimens were heat-inactivated at 56 C for 30 mm and tested by the plaque-reduction neu- tralization test (McLean et a!., 1985, 1989) for antibody against the following arbo- viruses: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) (TBH- 28 strain), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) (NJ-160 strain), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) (TC83, lAB strain and Mena II, 1E strain), western equine en- cephalitis (WEE) (Fleming M I-2959B strain), vesicular stomatitis-Indiana (VSV- In) (lab strain), vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey (VSV-NJ) (Haze!hurst strain), epi- zootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) (New Jersey strain), bluetongue (BT) [BT-13 (67- 41B) and BT-17 strains], Cache Valley vi- rus (CV) (M23355 strain), Jamestown Can- yon virus (JC) (61V2235 strain), Nepuyo virus (NEP) (HBL7-2BG strain), and Rio Grande virus (RG) (TBM4-719 strain).

The pas- sive hemagglutmnation test and passive hemagglutination inhibition control test were used to detect antibodies against Y. pestis (Wolff and Hudson, 1974). Titers � 16 were considered indicative of expo- sure. The micro-agglutination test was used to detect antibodies against Francisella tu- larensis. Titers � 128 were considered to provide evidence of previous exposure (Stewart, 1988). Serum specimens from ungulate species were submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Brucellosis Laboratory (Denver, Colorado 80211, USA) for the detection of antibodies against Brucella abortus and Ana plasma margin- ale. Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease virus antibodies were tested by us- ing the ELISA Antibody Test Kit (Agritech Systems, Inc., Portland, Maine 04101, USA). Values for samples to known posi- tive (S/P) ratio of �0.2 were considered as not providing evidence of previous ex- posure. Bird specimens obtained in 1988 were submitted to the National Animal Health Reference Laboratory (Ames, Iowa 50010, USA) to test for serologic evidence of exposure to Myco plasma meleagridis, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chla- mydia psittaci. Serum samples obtained during summer 1989 were tested for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae antibodies by the stained antigen rapid plate agglu- tination test (Intervet America Inc., Mills- boro, Delaware 19966, USA). Serum specimens from 80 mammals of 14 families and 21 species were tested for antibody against 13 selected arboviruses, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. abortus, and A. marginale. Results for serologic tests for arboviral antigens in mammals are listed in Table 1. During 1988, 12 species from San Francisco presented antibodies to VSV-NJ and seven species had antibody to VSV-In. Of these, six species presented antibodies to both viruses. In 1988, anti- bodies to enzootic strain VEE-Mena II were present in seven species predomi- nated by small mammals. Antibody to VEE-TC83 strain was detected in three species including deer and two species of lagomorphs. From all the ruminants tested in 1988, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus vir- ginianus texanus) was the only species with serologic evidence of exposure to both BT serotypes and EHD. During 1989, two of six mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon) had an- tibodies to BT. All other ungulate sera test- ed negative to hemorrhagic disease. Desert cottontail (Sylvilagus auduboni) was the only species with serologic evidence to NEP (1/6). Jackrabbits (Lepus calif ornicus) (3/ 10) and a striped skunk (Mephitis me phi- tis) trapped during summer 1988, had di- agnostically significant titers (128) to F. tularensis. A white-tailed deer serum had serologic evidence of exposure to A. mar- ginale. There was no evidence of exposure to Y. pestis and B. abortus in the mam- malian specimens tested. Sera from 315 birds of 24 families and 44 species were tested for antibody to five arboviruses and six other selected avian pathogens (Table 2). During summer 1988, birds from 14 species had serologic evi- dence to the enzootic strain of VEE-Mena II. Antibodies to P. multocida were de- tected in five bird species in 1988 and two bird species in 1989. Newcastle disease vi- rus antibodies were also identified in two species for both years. A scaled quail (Cal- lipepla squamata) had a positive titer of 160 to M. meleagridis. No serologic evi- dence to selected arboviral antigens was found in 27 species of birds. Birds from 18 species had no antibodies to avian cholera and Newcastle disease. No serologic evi- dence of exposure to M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae and C. psittaci was identified in the bird specimens tested. The present study indicates that trans- mission of at least 12 arboviruses occurred prior to the summers of 1988 and 1989 in the mammal species tested in northeastern Mexico. Previous evidence of exposure to equine encephalitis viruses in wild and do- mestic mammals has been reported in Mexico (Scherer and Dickerman, 1972; Gonzalez-Cortes et a!., 1975).

This survey identified five new species with serologic evidence to VEE in Mexico including striped skunk, white-tailed deer, kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), woodrat (Ne- otoma mexicana), and jackrabbit. It is un- known, however, if all of these species act as effective reservoir hosts. Nepuyo virus was isolated for the firsttime in Mexico in 1966 (Dickerman et al., 1971). There is evidence that this virus is widely distrib- uted and can cause epidemics in humans similar to dengue. The present study pro- vides the only serologic evidence of this arbovirus in cottontails in Mexico since that year.

During the present survey, three of five blackbuck (Antilope cervi- capra) obtained from Texas were seropos- itive to VS V-NJ. These animals were sam- pled the same day they arrived at Rancho San Francisco, Coahuila. These results may indicate activity of VSV in Texas. The im- plications of disease movement caused by wildlife translocations should be consid- ered. Although virus isolation was not at- tempted, the introduction of VSV into Mexico is a possibility. VSV is indigenous to the western hemisphere and epizootics have occurred in southeastern United States almost every year (Karstad, 1981). There is extensive serologic and virologic evi- dence of BT virus infection in domestic livestock from Mexico (Stott et a!., 1989). This study confirms exposure of white- tailed deer to BT-13 and BT-17, strains previously isolated in Mexico. To the best of our knowledge this is the first confirmed report of serologic evidence to EHD, VS- NJ, VS-In, CV, JC, and RG in wildlife in Mexico. These arboviruses are enzootic in areas of the United States bordering Mex- ico (Karabatsos, 1985). Tularemia titers obtained in jackrabbits and a skunk indicate that the disease may be active in Mexico. Implications to hu- man health are important since it is known that jackrabbits are a source of food to people in Mexico. To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the first serologic evidence of tularemia reported in wild mammals from Mexico. The present study indicates that the bird species sampled were exposed recently to four encephalitis viruses, of which three have been reported previously in Mexican birds. Campillo-Sainz (1969) found herons and egrets from five species with antibod- ies to SLE and WEE. SLE was isolated from water birds in Veracruz, Mexico (Dickerman et a!., 1972a). The present sur- vey of waterbirds identified similar num- bers of reactors to the ones previously re- ported for VEE in resident birds collected in southeastern Mexico (Dickerman et al., 1972b). It isknown that some mammals and birds may develop persistent viremias and act as amplifying hosts of these diseases in epi- zootic situations (Dickerman et a!., 1972b; McLean and Bowen, 1980; McLean et al., 1985). At least three of the equine en- cephalitis viruses (EEE, SLE, and VEE) have caused epidemics in humans and epi- zootics in horses in Mexico. The role of wildlife in any of these outbreaks is un- known. Birds appear to be particularly im- portant in the ecology of arboviral diseases. Mammals play an incidental role in the natural cycle, but this fact does not exclude the possibility of infection during epizootic situations. SLE and other flaviviruses have been present in Mexico for many years (Sosa-Martinez, 1963). To the best of our knowledge this is the first laboratory con- firmed serologic report of EEE in wild birds in Mexico. Further studies in the prevalence, transmission, and ecology of selected diseases in wildlife populations in Mexico are required. Increasing data on disease agents in a greater number of spe- cies and scattered locations raise questions regarding the possibilities of disease intro- duction and exchange between geograph- ical areas. There is supported evidence of annual reintroduction of arboviruses from areas south of the United States by migra- tory birds (Stamm and Newman, 1963; Calisher et a!., 1971; Dickerman et al., 1980). Surveillance for currently known dis- eases and isolation of new etiologic agents can be the initial attempt to establish the laboratory confirmed status of selected dis- eases in Mexico. The systematic collection of samples to establish the presence of dis- ease is essential in the continental man- agement of migratory species as well as other wildlife in North America.

Balseiro-2012-Louping ill in goats, Spain, 201.pdf	Dispatches.indd Louping Ill in Goats, Spain, 2011 Ana Balseiro, Luis J. Royo, Claudia Pérez Martínez, Isabel G. Fernández de Mera, Úrsula Höfl e, Laura Polledo, Nelson Marreros, Rosa Casais, and Juan F. García Marín Although louping ill affects mainly sheep, a 2011 outbreak in northern Spain occurred among goats. Histopathologic lesions and molecular genetics identifi ed a new strain of louping ill virus, 94% identical to the strain from Britain. Surveillance is needed to minimize risk to domestic and wildlife species and humans. Louping ill is a zoonotic disease caused by a neurotropic, single-stranded, 40 to 50–nm RNA virus, which has been classifi ed in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Louping ill virus belongs to a subgroup antigenically related to viruses known as the tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEVs) of Europe (1). These viruses are medically considered to be the most common fl aviviruses in Europe and Asia (2). Among them, the TBEVs, which infect thousands of humans per year (3), are related to louping ill virus. Most reports of louping ill virus originate from the British Islands; knowledge with regard to the strain from Spain is limited. Because it is a tick-transmitted disease, the distribution of louping ill is closely associated with the distribution of the primary vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus. It mainly affects sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but many other species have been reported to be susceptible, including dogs, llamas, alpacas, goats, pigs, and humans (2). Infection with a strain of louping ill virus from Spain was fi rst reported for sheep in the Basque region of northern Spain in 1987. For several years during the spring, mortality rates for lambs and yearlings in infected fl ocks were high (4). The causative agent was identifi ed as Spanish sheep encephalitis virus (SSEV) (5). Additional studies failed to isolate the virus from ticks (6) in the region where the fi rst cases occurred, indicating that prevalence of SSEV, if present, was low. To our knowledge, no cases of encephalitis caused by a fl avivirus in ungulates in Spain have been described since then. Also to our knowledge, no cases of tick-borne fl avivirus infection in humans have been reported in Spain, although 1 case of tick-borne encephalitis in a person from southwestern France was considered to have been caused by an SSEV subtype virus (3,7). Therefore, except for the 1 person in France, SSEV infections seem to be restricted to sheep and to the Basque region of northern Spain. We report suspected infection of a herd of Bermeya goats (an endangered breed of Asturian goats) with a TBEV. The Cases In September 2011, a herd of 70 adult goats was purchased in southern Asturias and then moved to northern Asturias. Within 1 month, 1 goat became ill. The fi rst sign was hindleg lameness, which quickly progressed to incoordination, fever, tremors, and bulging eyes. The goat died 2 days later, after which 17 other goats (including 2 goatlings born on the farm) showed the same signs and died over a 4-month period. Many ticks were found on these animals (≈10–15 ticks/goat), and Butox (Merck, Madrid, Spain) was applied. Necropsy was performed on 2 adult goats; gross lesions were recorded and special attention was paid to the nervous system. Samples for histopathologic examination were taken from the brain (cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, and brain stem), spinal cord, liver, kidney, adrenal glands, lungs, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. They were fi xed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and 4-μm hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections were produced. Samples of brain tissue were also taken for molecular analysis. Total RNA was extracted (TRIzol reagent; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), treated with DNase 1 (Takara Bio Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA by using random hexamers (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [avian myeloblastosis virus]); Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Real- time RT-PCR primers designed to detect all viruses in the family Flaviviridae (8) were used in a conventional RT-PCR protocol, and a 231-bp amplicon was detected and sequenced (BigDye Terminator, version 3.1, Cycle Sequencing Kit protocol; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). To compare the phylogenetic relationships of the isolate virus with other representative TBEV strains, we constructed an unweighted pair-group method analysis tree in MEGA 5 (9), by using published TBEV sequences (8) and the Three Arch Rock Island strain of Tyuleniy virus as an outgroup. During necropsy of the 2 goats, no gross lesions were found. No histopathologic lesions were found in any organ system except the central nervous system (Figure 1).

Marreros) DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1806.120220 Louping Ill in Goats, Spain cerebellum showed necrosis of Purkinje cells and neurons. Histopathologic examination of the rest of the brain revealed a mild meningeal infi ltration with widespread lymphocytic perivascular cuffs and evidence of neurophagia and gliosis, characterized by degenerating neurons surrounded by glia cells. These lesions were concentrated in the hypothalamus and midbrain and were more severe in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. The histopathologic lesions observed in these goats were indistinguishable from those caused by louping ill virus (10). Molecular genetic studies enabled identifi cation of the virus. The sequence (Genbank accession no. JQ646028) was 94% identical to the strain from Britain (EU074000) and 93% identical to the strains from Spain (EU074016) and the Negishi virus (EU074002), thus confi rming identity of the Asturian strain louping ill virus. Phylogenetic analysis, conducted by using the unweighted pair-group method analysis tree (Figure 2) shows how the new virus strain is related to the strains from Britain and Spain. Conclusions Histopathologic lesions together with molecular genetic results enabled a defi nitive diagnosis: tick-borne encephalitis caused by an Asturian strain of louping ill virus. These cases confi rm the infection in species other than sheep in Spain and the presence of the virus in areas of northern Spain other than the Basque region. An epidemiologic survey confi rmed that no clinical signs were observed for the source herd in southern Asturias. However, a few years ago, another herd, located in the same area to which the affected herd described here had been moved, showed similar signs; 8 of 20 goats died. Although a diagnosis was not confi rmed for this earlier outbreak, the facts suggest that the virus might have been in this area for several years.

Numerous cases of human infection have been described (11). Humans can become infected in a variety of ways. Infections have been naturally acquired in persons who had direct contact with infected animals, for example on the farm or in laboratory settings (11,12). The virus can also be transmitted by direct mucous or respiratory pathways. Another route for infection is the consumption of milk from infected goats or products (cheese, butter, or yogurt) made from milk from infected goats (13). The presence of the virus in milk could represent a public health hazard if the milk is not pasteurized. The Bermeya goat is considered to be at high risk for extinction, and many efforts have been made by breeders and the local administration of agriculture to limit the loss of genetic variability in these goats. The cases reported here provide an example of how an infectious disease can also reduce the local genetic resources. These cases, together with the case described in the Basque region, underline the need for a specifi c surveillance plan in northern Spain that focuses on ticks, wildlife species, and livestock. This plan will be crucial for determining the actual effects of louping ill on hunting, animal breeding, and human health.

This represents the first isolation of SLE virus from a marine mammal. The animal presented with reduced appetite, rapidly became lethar- gic and subsequently died. Virus-induced CPE was observed in a dolphin cell line, SP-1K (ATCC CCL 78), inoculated with brain, kidney, and lung tissues obtained at necropsy. Electron microscopy of infected SP-1 K cells revealed the presence of virions having morphology and size resembling members of the Flaviviridae. Final identifi- cation as SLE virus was made by neutralization and immunofluorescence staining tests. Key words: Flavivirus; Orcinus orca; Encephalitis; Marine mammal Introduction Case Report A mature male killer whale (Orcinus orca), estimated to be 25 or more years old, presented with reduced appetite. Within 24 h, the animal became lethargic. The animal died in September, 1990, within 48 h after the onset of clinical signs, while under veterinary care. The necropsy was unremarkable, but the histopathology examination reported a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. Laboratory Studies Virus isolation. Frozen samples of brain, lung, kidney and several other organs were sent to the ATCC Virology Laboratory as part of an ongoing screen for viruses of cetaceans. All tissues were thawed, mixed with sterile sand and tissue culture medium, and aseptically ground with a mortar and pestle. The suspensions were clarified by low-speed centrifugation (500 x g for 10 min) and the supernatants were used to Correspondence to."" C. Buck, Virology Department, ATCC, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. 110 inoculate primary African Green Monkey kidney cells, SP-1K (a dolphin cell line, ATCC CCL 78) cells and bovine turbinate (ATCC CRL 1390) cells. Upon initial inoculation, bacterial contaminations were noted in all cultures. All first passage cultures were frozen, thawed and blind passaged on fresh cells in the presence of 100 #g/ml gentamycin sulfate. Possible CPE was noted in SP-1K cells inoculated with the brain, kidney and lung samples. These samples were passed through a 0.2-#m filter and a third passage was made on SP-1K cells. A definitive CPE was then observed from the brain, lung and kidney samples; cells became rounded and refractile and detached from the flask. No further attempts were made to isolate the agent from the bovine turbinate and primary monkey kidney cells. The bacterial contaminants, although not identified, do not at this time appear related to the animal's death. Many of the necropsy samples received by ATCC for viral screening from cetaceans have bacterial or fungal contaminants. This is due in part to the cetacean's large size and insulating layer of blubber which make it impossible to quickly cool the animal after death. As a result, bacteria from the intestine and other non-sterile areas quickly multiply and spread throughout the peritoneal cavity. Electron microscopy. When infected SP-1K cells showed distinct CPE, they were removed from the flask and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for two hours. Fixed cell suspensions were sent to the VA Virology Laboratory in West Haven, Connecticut by overnight mail. The cells were postfixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr's resin as described previously (Hsiung, 1982). Thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1). For each of the three (brain, lung and kidney) SP-1K samples, numerous enveloped virus particles 40-50 nm in size were seen in the cytoplasm. Each particle had an electron-dense core 25 nm in diameter; virus particles budding from the plasma membrane were also observed (Fig. 1, inset). With the noted size and morphology, the isolate was tentatively identified as a member of the Flaviviridae family. Final identification. A virus preparation propagated from the brain sample, having a titer of 104.5 tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDso) was inactivated by exposure to 20% chloroform for two hours. A neutralization test on the same virus preparation was performed in SP-1K cells. Antisera to Japanese encephalitis virus (ATCC VR- 1259AF) suppressed the appearance of CPE for 72 h, but CPE subsequently devel- oped. In contrast, antisera to St. Louis encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-1265AF) com- pletely neutralized the infectious virus through the entire 7 days incubation. In addition, acetone-fixed infected and non-infected SP-1K cells were sent to Dr. Karabatsos at the CDC Arbovirus Diseases Branch of the Division for Vector-Borne Infectious Disease, CDC in Fort Collins, CO, for confirmation. Using monoclonal SLE type-specific antibody (Roehrig et al., 1983), the three isolates were identified as St. Louis encephalitis virus by the immunofluorescent staining test (Nick Karabatsos, personal communication). It should be noted that, although two strains of SLE are available through the ATCC, neither has been propagated at the ATCC during the past four years that the marine mammal screening program has been active. Consequently, it is very unlikely that the three SLE isolates, from a single animal, were the result of cross-contamination from existing stocks. 111 Fig. I. Electron micrograph of SLE virus-infected SP-1K cell showing numerous cytoplasmic virus particles. Inset: virus budding into cytoplasmic vacuole. Discussion We have been unable to find any reference to SLE virus infecting marine mammals in the current literature (McLean and Bowen, 1980; Buck and Schroeder, 1990; Kennedy-Stospkopf, 1990; Monath, 1990). Since 1933, when the SLE virus was first isolated from a human brain, there have been many recognized epidemics of St. Louis encephalitis in the United States. The clinical cases associated with these outbreaks, and the intervening endemic periods, have been most frequent in California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana (Monath, 1990). SLE is a member of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) antigenic subgroup of the Flaviviridae (Wengler, 1991). Wild birds appear to be the primary (maintaining) vertebrate host, and the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from infected viremic birds to susceptible birds. When conditions are suitable (large numbers of viremic birds and large numbers of mosquitoes), transmission to incidental hosts such as humans and horses occurs. Although several members of the JE subgroup are 112 pathogenic for humans, only the prototype JE strain is economically important as a disease of domestic animals (Fenner, 1987). SLE virus does not cause clinical disease in horses and other domestic mammals (Monath, 1990). Even in humans where SLE can cause severe encephalitis, many cases of SLE go undiagnosed or are subclinical (Monath, 1990). In the present case, the killer whale apparently contracted SLE virus during a recognized SLE outbreak in Florida (CDC, 1990a,b). It is likely that, as with humans, killer whales are incidental hosts in the SLE cycle. Other cetaceans in the vicinity of the infected animal showed no illness consistent with SLE and were seronegative for SLE antibody (data not presented). The absence of reports associating illness or death of any marine mammal with SLE or other member of the Japanese encephalitis group further suggests that infections of marine mammals by infected mosquitoes are quite rare or, as in the case of many terrestrial mammals, most SLE infections are subclinical. This report of an unexpected isolation of St. Louis Encephalitis virus from a cetacean demonstrates the importance of viral screening in animal species where the knowledge of viral pathogens is limited. The EM examination provided a rapid presumptive identification of an unknown agent which was confirmed by antibody neutralization and immunofluorescent staining tests. Studies are currently under way to identify two additional agents recently isolated in cell culture from other marine mammal specimens.

Although a great deal is known about them, detailed information is needed to explain the astonishing variations of their anatomy, their lifestyles, their roles in ecosystems ecol- ogy, and their importance as reservoir hosts of viruses of proven or potential significance for human and veterinary health. Bats fly with wings which range in span from 130 mm to 2 m. Bats of various species feed on insects, mammals, fish, blood, fruit, and pollen. Bats of most species echolocate to navigate and to find prey. Bats are found on all continents except Ant- arctica. Bats also are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts for viruses which can cross species barriers (i.e., “spill over”) to infect humans and other domestic and wild mam- mals. Nonetheless, studies of the natural histories of bats and their importance as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses largely have been underappreciated and underfunded, except for their role in maintaining and transmitting rabies virus. Irrespective of the negative public perception of bats, they are critical elements of all terrestrial biotic communities. They help con- trol insects, reseed cut forests, and pollinate plants that provide food for humans and other species, and their guano is used as a fertilizer and for manufacturing soaps, gasohol, and antibi- otics (21, 69, 83). Bat echolocation and signal processing have provided models for sonar systems (112, 130). Myths and misunderstandings about the roles of bats in ecosystems and their danger to other species as hosts of rabies virus have led to efforts to extirpate bat populations, with serious consequent effects on insect control and crop produc- tion, without coincidental reduction in the already low inci- dence of rabies virus transmission by bats (93). This paper summarizes what is known about viruses isolated from bats. Although there is serologic evidence for infection of bats with many viruses (see, for example, references 82 and 101), we will focus here only on the 66 viruses that have been * Corresponding author.

Some of these bat-borne viruses can cause diseases of humans and other animals. The roles played by bats in the maintenance and transmission of viruses require consideration of the unique characteristics that distinguish bats from all other mammals. Examples are drawn from the extensive literature on rabies virus in bats, as well as from recent data on the roles of bats in the natural cycles of other viruses. Evolution and Phylogeny of Bats Whereas other mammals, such as certain species of rodents (order Rodentia) and carnivores (order Carnivora), may pos- sess traits in common with species of bats, such as the ability to hibernate, no group of mammals shares the full suite of at- tributes that make bats unique. Of the more than 4,600 recog- nized species of mammals, 925 (about 20%) are bats (147). Bats are grouped into two suborders: Megachiroptera, contain- ing a single family, Pteropodidae (42 genera, comprising 166 species), and Microchiroptera, containing 16 bat families (135 genera, comprising 759 species) (Table 1) (138). Bats evolved early and have changed relatively little in com- parison with mammals of other taxa (69). Although the fossil record of bat evolution is incomplete (77), a recent analysis of 17 nuclear genes dated the origin of chiropterans to the Eo- cene period (52 to 50 million years ago), coincident with a significant rise in global temperature (147). Three major mi- crochiropteran lineages were traced to Laurasia and a fourth to Gondwana (147). The correspondingly ancient origins de- duced for certain zoonotic viruses maintained in bats, such as the henipaviruses (60) and lyssaviruses (10), suggest a long history of cospeciation. Viruses that evolved with bats may have used for replication cellular receptors and biochemical pathways which are conserved in mammals that evolved later and which underwent radiation in later geological periods. If so, these conserved cellular receptors and pathways could en- hance the capacity for transmission of bat-associated viruses to other mammals. Ability To Fly Bats are unique among mammals in their ability to fly. Bats fly daily in pursuit of food, and bats of many species fly long distances during seasonal migrations (62). For example, bats of Myotis spp. may travel 200 to 400 miles from their winter hibernation sites (reviewed in reference 62), and Mexican free- tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) migrate at least 800 miles between their summer caves in Texas and New Mexico and their overwintering sites in Mexico (36) and are otherwise very widely distributed. In France, rabies virus infections have been associated with the migratory routes of Nathusius’ pipis- trelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) bats (20). Silver-haired bats (La- sionycteris noctivagans) seasonally range from Alaska, across Canada, and south to Texas (13). Rabies virus variants associ- ated with silver-haired bats and the Eastern pipistrelle (Pipis- trellus subflavus) have been identified from numerous locations throughout the geographic range of these bats (106, 124), and the same variants have been identified as the cause of the majority of cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the United States and Canada (127). Different patterns of migration within the same species of bat, as occurs with relatively solitary species, such as the silver- haired bat (69), and colonial cave-dwelling species, such as Mexican free-tailed bats (128), may permit exchange of novel viruses or virus variants between migrating and nonmigrating subpopulations of conspecifics or bats of other species. A Mex- ican free-tailed bat infected with a rabies virus variant normally associated with hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), suggests inter- species transmission (124). In the field, rabid bats of one spe- cies have been observed to be aggressive toward bats of other species (14). Moreover, Shankar et al. (136), in a study of the phylogenesis of divergence of rabies viruses from bats and terrestrial animals in Colorado, found that bats of different species had the same genotypic variants, indicating active in- terspecies transmission of rabies virus. They concluded that, at least in Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats and that identification of bat-associated variants of rabies viruses in domestic cats, gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) demonstrates the impor- tance of rabies virus spillover from bats to domestic and ter- restrial wild vertebrates. Torpor and Hibernation An important trait of temperate bats of the families Vesper- tilionidae and Rhinolophidae is their ability to enter into daily torpor and seasonal hibernation to conserve energy during cool nights and winter months (89). The impact of torpor and hibernation on the pathogenesis and maintenance of viral in- fections in bats has not been studied extensively. However, viruses may overwinter in bats, and persistently infected bats may shed viruses, such as lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae) or flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) for extensive periods with- out evidence of disease (143). Virus isolation and antibody studies suggest that many viruses can cause persistent infec- tions in bats (82). When big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifigus) were experimentally infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and then subjected to temperatures TABLE 1.

With few exceptions, e.g., rabies virus, relatively little is known about the natural history of these viruses or about non-arthropod-transmitted viruses of bats. c Issyk-Kul and Keterah viruses may be synonyms. 534 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV. tibody titers. Nevertheless, the fact that infectious JEV was recovered from seropositive bats 15 weeks after the shift in temperature indicated that infection persisted (143). It is pos- sible that neutralizing antibody has a shorter half-life in bats than in other mammals. Tick-borne encephalitis virus and other viruses have been isolated from bats with neutralizing antibody, and bats are susceptible to reinfection with tick- borne encephalitis viruses (82). High titers of virus were obtained from brown fat of appar- ently healthy bats inoculated with rabies virus when the bats were kept at low temperatures (4, 142, 143). Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) that survive challenge with rabies virus may excrete virus in their saliva (1). Rabies virus was isolated from big brown bats that were captured to establish colonies and then died in the first month of captivity (135). Antiviral antibodies were detected in sera of several apparently healthy bats born in the new colony, suggesting past or subclinical rabies virus infection (135). Mexican free-tailed bats may trans- mit rabies virus transplacentally, as evidenced by the fact that infectious virus was isolated from cell lines established from fetal tissues of these bats (141). Studies of Mexican free-tailed bats roosting at a colony in Austin, Texas, identified rabies virus in about 70% of several hundred downed, dead, or dying bats, which represented a relatively small proportion of the estimated 600,000 bats in that colony. Over the study’s 2-year duration, about 45% of apparently healthy bats from this roost were found to have neutralizing antibody to rabies virus, sug- gesting acquired immunity following prior exposure (101; C. Rupprecht [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.], personal communication, 2006). Because only one or another of many methods usually is applied in studies of rabies virus in bats, we do not know the proportion of bats having both viral RNA in their tissues and antibody to rabies virus. Temperate and tropical bats of the family Molossidae ap- pear to be transitional between true hibernating bats and trop- ical bats that have limited ability to enter torpor. For example, the Western bonneted bat (Eumops perotis) enters a period of daily torpor during the winter that is similar to the daily hiber- nation or torpor that occurs in temperate zone bats during the summer (89). Long Life Span The extreme longevity of bats, together with the possibility that they might develop persistent infections with certain vi- ruses, may help maintain the viruses and transmit them to other vertebrates. Many species of small temperate bats of the suborder Microchiroptera have life spans that exceed 25 years, with the greatest longevity, of 35 years, documented for a little brown bat. (On average, little brown bats weigh about 7 g.) This extreme longevity in a small mammal places bats well outside the traditional regression line for mammals that relates the life expectancy (9) to the ratio of metabolic rate to body weight (see reference 44, Fig. 45). If bats routinely become persistently infected by certain vi- ruses, and infectivity lasts for months or possibly years, the impact on the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) would be significant. R0 is the expected number of newly in- fected hosts that one infectious host will produce during its period of infectiousness in a large population of completely susceptible individuals (65). Since R0 is the sum of the products of the average duration of infection, the average contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, and the prob- ability of transmission per contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual, increased duration of infectiousness or increased prevalence of infection in a population can dramat- ically enhance the potential for secondary infections that em- anate from a single infected individual. Persistent viral infec- tions occurring among long-lived bats, coupled with their often gregarious roosting behavior, could greatly increase the poten- tial for intra- and interspecies transmission of viruses. Population Size and Roosting Behavior The frequently great population densities of bats and their crowded roosting behavior increase the likelihood of intra- and interspecies transmission of viral infections. Bats are the most abundant of mammals, and except for humans and perhaps rodents, they are the most widely distributed land mammals (154). Certain species of bats, such as Mexican free-tailed bats, are highly gregarious and roost in southwestern caves of the United States, such as Carlsbad Caverns and Frio Cave, in densely packed aggregates of approximately 300 bats per ft2 (37), in populations comprising several million individuals (37, 94). Under these conditions the only example of airborne ra- bies virus transmission was documented, either in droplets of excreta or by small particle aerosol (38, 155). Bat Population Structure The demographic and spatial structuring of bat populations is sufficiently variable to offer opportunities for viruses that cause both acute and persistent infections to be maintained. The potential for migratory and nonmigratory populations to serve as a mixing vessel for viruses has already been men- tioned. Additionally, within given regions, bat populations may be panmictic or may exist as metapopulations, offering the potential for seasonal virus transmission and annual outbreaks of viral diseases as well as the potential for periodic outbreaks among spatially discrete populations. Colonial microchiropterans (such as Schreibers’ long-fin- gered bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Mexican free-tailed bats) typically exist in panmictic populations of hundreds of thousands or millions of individuals and produce an annual birth pulse (37). In theory, such large bat populations could sustain acute viral infections that produce permanent steriliz- ing immunity in affected individuals in a manner akin to that of measles morbillivirus, which persists to cause annual outbreaks only when human communities exceed 250,000 to 500,000 (16). The persistence of measles virus within demographically het- erogeneous human populations, whereby different communi- ties are affected in different years, may give rise to viral per- sistence in spatially discrete “patches,” in which infection dies out sequentially rather than simultaneously (17). A different pattern of social structure is present among other colonial bats that have a metapopulation structure (consisting of periodically interacting, spatially discrete subpopulations). Flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) have such a structure. In this sit- uation, the total number of individuals in the various subpopu- VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 535 lations or “patches” must be sufficient to maintain virus circu- lation in the metapopulation over time, while immunity or death due to viral infection extinguishes transmission chains within individual subpopulations. Periodic outbreaks of viral infection and disease may then be expected among given sub- populations in a region, once the number of susceptible indi- viduals has recovered through births or loss of immunity, such that the populations once again can support viral transmission with an R0 of �1. Such periodic outbreaks of acute, even fatal viral disease are well documented for rabies virus among ter- restrial carnivores (28) and may occur among vampire bats, as exemplified by the so-called “migration” of rabies virus in vampire bat populations in different regions with a 2- to 3-year cycle (19, 126). Preliminary modeling suggests that Hendra virus persists in Australian flying foxes in this way (H. E. Field, unpublished data). Given that the phylogenetic distance of Hendra virus (and Nipah virus) from other viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae suggests that these are ancient viruses that likely have an evolutionary association with their flying fox hosts, it is both intuitive and biologically plausible that the maintenance of Hendra virus infection in flying foxes is based on the spa- tially heterogeneous population structure and nomadic na- ture of flying foxes. Echolocation Microchiropteran bats are, with rare exceptions among the Megachiroptera (69, 71), the only land mammals that emit sounds and then detect and characterize the time delay and signal properties of returning echoes for the purpose of navi- gation (echolocation). Although certain birds and several spe- cies of megachiropterans use primitive echolocation, the de- gree to which neural and muscular systems of bats have evolved to produce echolocation signals, protect the individual bat from its own potentially deafening emissions, and decipher the information contained in returning echoes is unique. How- ever, acoustic imaging is energy-intensive, corresponding to an energy flux of as much as 6 � 10�6 J/m2 per echolocation call (113). The intense, high-frequency echolocation signals, rang- ing between 80 and 110 dB at a distance of 1 m from the emitting bat, approximate the range between the noise level produced by a coffee grinder and that produced at a rock concert or by a jet plane at ramp (5, 113). Echolocation signals are produced by the larynx, are powered by the muscles of the abdominal wall of bats, and are emitted through the mouth or nostrils (113). Production of such loud sounds also could gen- erate droplets or small-particle aerosols of oropharyngeal flu- ids, mucus, or saliva, enabling transmission of viruses between individuals in close proximity. The hypothesis that rabies virus could be expelled from the nostrils of echolocating bats was supported by the isolation of rabies virus from mucus obtained from naturally infected Mexican free-tailed bats (39). Bat Immunology Why can certain viruses infect and persist in apparently healthy bats yet be highly pathogenic for humans and other vertebrates? Because bats were among the earliest mammalian species to develop, it is possible that their innate and acquired immune responses have important qualitative or quantitative differences from those of the rodents and primates which have been studied extensively. Do bats have a different set point in their immune responses, one that results in control of the level of virus replication without clearance of infectious virus in order to prevent immunopathological responses in infected tissues? Are all of the innate immune mechanisms that are presumed to have preceded the development of acquired im- mune responses also functional in bats? Is there affinity mat- uration of antibodies in bats? What are the properties of cell- mediated immune responses in bats? Significant differences in immune responses to viral infection likely will be found among the very large number and diversity of bat species, and it is unlikely that immunological reagents will be reactive across all bat species. Very little is known about bat immune systems, although several studies suggest that immune responses of bats have some similarities with those of mammals that evolved after bats. For example, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM have been purified from sera of great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus) (96). Macrophages, B- and T-lymphocyte-like cells, and cells expressing surface Ig were identified in the bone marrow of Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), indicating that lymphoid development is generally similar in bats and other mammals (26, 131). Presumably in bats, as with other mammals, the generation of high-titer IgG requires two events mediated by helper T cells: class switching and affinity matu- ration. Serological assays that detect IgG antibodies to Hendra vi- rus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS- CoV)-like viruses, and Ebola viruses in bats (66, 84, 85) indi- cate that some virus-specific adaptive T- and B-cell responses occur despite persistent virus infection. Further studies will require development of cell culture-based assays for examining lymphocyte proliferation, antibody synthesis, cytokine synthe- sis, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats. VIRUSES FOUND IN BATS Table 2 lists the large number of viruses that have been isolated from or detected in bats, but most of these viruses have not been shown to be transmitted from bats to other animals or to cause human disease. Transmission from bats of viruses causing highly pathogenic disease has been demon- strated for rabies virus and related lyssaviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, and inferred for SARS-CoV-like virus of bats. The relationships of these viruses to their bat hosts and to zoonotic human diseases is described below. Other viruses in Table 2, such as certain alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunya- viruses, may infect bats via arthropods, but it is not clear whether bats are important reservoir hosts for these viruses. Clearly, a great deal of additional research is needed to doc- ument the roles of bats of different species in the natural history of the many viruses for which these remarkable animals can serve as hosts. Rabies Virus It would be impossible here to summarize the scientific lit- erature with regard to rabies and rabies virus. Therefore, we 536 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV. will merely summarize what we believe is relevant to this re- view. Descriptions of a disease consistent with rabies date from 4,000 years ago. The Eshnunna code invoked penalties for knowingly allowing a “mad” dog to bite a human (12). In the first century of this era, Celsus warned of fatal bites from animals and suggested that such bites may contain venom (i.e., “virus”). However, it was not until the late 19th century that rabies virus was studied methodically. Louis Pasteur amplified the virus in rabbit spinal cord and prepared and administered a vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis. Those classical studies laid the foundations for virology and immunology. Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, sero- type 1/genotype 1) is transmitted between mammals, including bats, primarily through the bite inoculation of rabies virus present in the saliva of infected individuals (95). The dual characters of transmitting rabies virus and being hematopha- gous (i.e., vampire bats) have cast a shadow on bats. Bats of three species (Diphylla ecaudata [hairy-legged vampire bat], Diaemus youngi (white-winged vampire bat), and Desmodus rotundus [vampire bat]) are known vampires and have been found to be involved in transmission of rabies virus, although available evidence indicates that only the latter is important in this regard (149). Globally, a vanishingly small proportion of the approxi- mately 55,000 annual human deaths caused by rabies virus are caused by variants of virus associated with bats (81). Although most cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the United States are caused by bat-associated variants of rabies virus, the average of 1 or 2 cases per year over the past 2 decades indicates the rarity of these events (101). In the United States, most rabies victims do not recall having been bitten by a bat, which may be due to the small size of the biting animal or to unusual circumstances leading to the bite (127). Recent evidence suggests that all rabies virus variants that affect terrestrial carnivores originated from cross-species trans- mission of bat-associated variants of rabies virus (10). A mo- lecular clock model based on genetic divergence of rabies virus variants in bats of different species suggests that in North America the divergence of extant bat-associated rabies viruses from a common ancestor occurred about 1651 to 1660 C.E. The bat rabies virus variants found in Latin America in com- mon vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and in free-tailed bats (genus Tadarida, family Mollosidae) are closest to the earliest common ancestor. Adaptation of rabies virus variants occurred earlier and more rapidly in bats of colonial genera (genera Eptesicus and Myotis) than in bats of more solitary genera (Lasionycteris, Pipistrellus, and Lasiuris) (74). Bat variants of rabies virus sporadically spill over to infect mammals other than humans (97). Sustained transmission of bat variants of rabies virus within populations of red foxes on Prince Edward Island and striped skunks in Arizona (40, 45) proceeded until natural extinction or control by vaccination. Lyssaviruses Related to Rabies Virus Rabies virus is related to other lyssaviruses from bats, ro- dents, and arthropods (137). There are seven lyssavirus geno- types and an additional four novel genotypes recently recov- ered from bats in Eurasia (Table 2), which probably will be included in this genus (67, 151). Some of these viruses, most notably Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) (140), can cause a fatal human illness indistinguishable from classic rabies (68, 129), but other lyssaviruses are not known to cause disease in vertebrates. The diagnosis of rabies in humans and animals traditionally was restricted to the acute fatal encephalomyelitis caused by rabies virus serotype 1/genotype 1, but now the disease “rabies” includes any of the fatal illnesses caused by any lyssavirus (67). Details of the maintenance cycles for lyssaviruses other than rabies virus, such as Duvenhage, Lagos bat, and Mokola vi- ruses (Table 2), are unclear (111). However, as with rabies virus, their perpetuation is assumed to involve bite transmis- sion, primarily involving conspecifics of the reservoir host spe- cies, with occasional spillover to other susceptible vertebrates. Individuals of other species have been sporadically found to be infected by these rarely identified lyssaviruses, including a hu- man with Duvenhage virus (100, 144), domestic cats and a dog with Lagos bat virus (54, 80, 98), and humans, domestic cats, and dogs with Mokola virus (15, 46, 47, 53, 110). In May 1996, a lyssavirus was isolated from tissues of a black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) with signs of encephalitis found near Ballina, New South Wales, Australia (55). Six months later, a bat handler from Rockhampton, Queensland, Austra- lia, developed numbness and weakness in her arm and later died from encephalitis. She had been infected with what is now known as ABLV. In 1998, a woman from Mackay (Queens- land, Australia) was diagnosed with ABLV infection at her death, 2 years after having been bitten by a sick bat (68). Protection trials with mice conducted at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., indicated that a rabies human diploid cell vaccine might be useful for prophy- laxis against this virus (90). Recent serologic evidence suggests that this virus also is present in bats in Thailand (88). Because of the colonial nature of many bats, it is likely that this virus may be found wherever the host bats are found. Henipaviruses In 1994 an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness occurred in a human and 14 horses in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Australia. Twenty-one horses and two humans (the trainer and a stable hand) were infected (109). Four additional outbreaks, in 1994, 1999, and 2004, infected five horses and two humans, killing all but one human (49, 72, 116, 123, 133). A virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus [named after Hendra and Nipah viruses]) was shown to be the etiologic agent of this disease (109). The natural hosts and probable reservoirs of Hendra virus are fruit bats (“flying foxes”) of the genus Pteropus, including the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), gray-headed flying fox (P. poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), and spectacled flying fox (P. conspicillatus) (50). Little is known about the dynamics of infection in flying foxes and how Hendra virus infection is maintained in them. Field (50) proposed three alternative models for the main- tenance of infection: (i) infection is enzootic in all species throughout their distribution; (ii) infection is enzootic in a particular species with a periodic epizootic pattern in the other species; or (iii) infection is periodically epizootic in all these species, persisting in a spatial or temporal mosaic across their distribution. He contends that the apparent pattern of known VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 537 “spillovers” from flying foxes to horses fits better with either of the two latter hypotheses. That is, a periodic outbreak in a local population of flying foxes results in an increased proba- bility of spillover to horses in a specific locality during a limited time period. An outbreak of Hendra virus infection in a local population of flying foxes may depend on attainment of a threshold number of susceptible flying foxes in the population and introduction of the virus into the population from a no- madic individual or group. These concepts are well studied for related morbilliviruses (17, 146). A situation analogous to the circumstances being proposed for spillover of Hendra virus to horses has been described for rabies virus spillover to domestic cats. In the eastern United States, there is a strong association between the local temporal dynamics of rabies epizootics within a reservoir host species, in this case the raccoon (Pro- cyon lotor), which serves as the regional reservoir host for a specific variant of rabies virus, and an increase in the risk of rabies spillover to domestic cats (59). Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus related to Hendra virus, was first isolated in 1999 from pigs and adult human males affected by fever and encephalitis, some with respiratory illness, during a major outbreak in peninsular Malaysia and then in Singapore (23, 24, 31). Of 265 reported human cases, 105 were fatal. Direct contact with infected pigs was identified as the predom- inant mode of human infection (33, 57). Most of the humans affected in the Malaysian outbreak had a history of direct contact with live pigs, and most were adult male Chinese pig farmers (31, 117). More than 1 million pigs were culled to contain the outbreak. With the knowledge that Pteropus spe- cies bats were the likely reservoir of the closely related Hendra virus in Australia, Malaysian bats were prioritized for surveil- lance. Like most other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia has a great diversity of bat species, including 13 species of Megachiroptera and 60 species of Microchiroptera (99). The large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and the variable flying fox (P. hypomelanus) were found to be natural reservoir hosts for Nipah virus (34, 76). Since 2001, sporadic outbreaks of Nipah virus-associated disease in humans have been identified in Bangladesh (6, 7, 8, 73). Although many characteristics of these outbreaks were similar to those of the Malaysian outbreak, including delayed recognition, a primary presentation with fever and central ner- vous system signs, and a high case fatality rate, in Bangladesh the human cases were not associated with disease in pigs, and there was some evidence suggesting human-to-human trans- mission (73). Serologic surveys of domestic and wild animals undertaken after the 2001 and 2003 outbreaks in Bangladesh provided evidence of Nipah virus infection only in Indian flying foxes (6, 73). Concurrent serologic surveillance of Indian flying foxes in India in 2003 found that 54% had neutralizing anti- bodies to Nipah virus (J. H. Epstein et al., personal commu- nication, 2006), suggesting that Nipah virus or a closely related virus was widespread across the range of Indian flying foxes. Chadha et al. (25) recently reported the occurrence of Nipah virus infections in humans in India in 2001. Neutralizing anti- bodies to Nipah virus were found in large flying foxes in Indo- nesia (134) and Cambodia (114), and Nipah virus was isolated from Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Cambodia (121). Thus, the henipaviruses likely occur across the entire global distribu- tion of pteropid bats (66). Available evidence suggests that Hendra and Nipah viruses are ancient viruses that have long circulated in their natural hosts, flying foxes (60). What precipitated the apparent recent emergence of these viruses? Can we identify environmental factors that altered flying fox ecology and facilitated the move- ment of henipaviruses (and other bat-associated zoonotic agents) beyond their natural ecological niches? Disease emer- gence requires, in addition to the presence of an agent, an effective bridge from the natural host to a susceptible spillover host. Such bridges may be caused by changes to the agent, the host, or the environment. Data on fruit bats of many species suggest that populations are in decline throughout their range, primarily as a result of habitat loss and hunting. In Australia, fruit bat roosting sites recently have been increasingly redis- tributed to urban areas (64). A scenario emerges of flying fox populations under stress, altered foraging and behavioral pat- terns, and virus niche expansion, all leading to closer proximity to humans and livestock. This certainly was the case with Nipah virus emergence (35). Chong et al. (30) suggested that the risk of humans contracting Nipah virus infection from bats is low. Once Nipah virus escapes its natural cycle, its epidemiologic characteristics are quite a different story. Menangle and Tioman Viruses Menangle virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Rubulavirus) was isolated in 1997 from stillborn piglets at a large commer- cial piggery near Menangle in Australia (118); the bat colony and the piggery had coexisted for 29 years before the incident. There were large numbers of within-litter fetal deaths at a variety of gestational ages. Most sows carried their litters to term, but abortions occasionally occurred. Affected litters in- cluded mummified, autolyzing, fresh stillborn, and live piglets. Teratogenic defects frequently seen included arthrogryposis, brachygnathia, and kyphosis. Internally, part or all of the brain and spinal cord was absent in most piglets, and there was malacia and nonsuppurative inflammation of the brains and spinal cords of some. Nonsuppurative myocarditis and hepati- tis also were present in some piglets (118). Two of 250 humans in contact with the infected pigs had high titers of antibodies to the new virus, and both reported a febrile illness with a measles-like rash, but neither had direct exposure to flying foxes (27). Individual bats living in a large, mixed colony of gray-headed flying foxes and little red flying foxes seasonally, and roosting within 200 m of the affected piggery, had neutralizing antibodies (118), as did flying foxes of other species from other colonies thousands of kilometers dis- tant and previous to the outbreak at Menangle (Field, unpub- lished); other species in the vicinity of the affected piggery were seronegative. Although attempts to isolate virus from flying foxes were unsuccessful, paramyxovirus-like virions labeled with antibody to Menangle virus from a convalescent sow were seen by electron microscopy in flying fox feces collected be- neath the roost near the piggery. Tioman virus, a rubulavirus distinct from Menangle virus, has been isolated from variable flying foxes in Malaysia. Little is known about the host range or pathogenesis of this newly recognized paramyxovirus (32). 538 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV. SARS-CoV-Like Viruses of Bats In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus (family Coronaviridae) was found to cause a new, severe acute respi- ratory syndrome in humans (92, 125). This virus, named SARS-CoV, is a distant relative of the group 2 coronavi- ruses that infect rodents, cattle, dogs, pigs, and humans and has been assigned to group 2b (58). It is distinct from two other coronaviruses recently identified in bats in southern China (84, 119). Epidemiologic studies showed that the earliest cases of SARS were associated with the wildlife meat industry. A survey of wildlife in a Shenzhen market recovered SARS-CoV-like viruses from masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and detected antibodies to the SARS-CoV-like virus in a hog badger (Arctonyx collaris) (63). Interestingly, the epidemiology of the outbreak in animals in the wildlife meat market resembled that of shipping fever, a viral syndrome that occurs when animals from different farms are comingled under crowded, stressful conditions. Under such circumstances, immune responses to persistent virus infections are reduced, virus shedding is increased, and susceptible ani- mals become infected and shed virus. In the marketplace where SARS-CoVs were detected, viral RNA from some ani- mals that were seronegative was detected by reverse transcrip- tion-PCR, suggesting acute infection, while other animals had antibodies to SARS-CoV but continued to shed virus, suggest- ing persistent infections (63). Although no pathology was as- sociated with SARS-CoV in animals in this market, civets inoculated with human isolates of SARS-CoV had severe lung pathology (156). By sequencing many viral genomes from SARS patients, wild and farmed civets, and other animals, a dendrogram was generated that showed that the first human SARS coronaviruses were closely related to a contemporary virus from masked palm civets and that point mutations were selected and accumulated later, as the virus passed from hu- man to human (139). Extensive surveys of viruses in domestic animals, poultry, and wildlife were done by reverse transcription-PCR to iden- tify the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Palm civets were found to be an incidental host rather than the principal host for SARS-CoV. Recently, several groups simultaneously identified bats from different locations in southern China as being in- fected with SARS-CoV-like viruses or having antibody to these newly recognized coronaviruses, including members of several species of Chinese horseshoe bats (suborder Microchirop- tera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) (Tables 1 and 2) (42, 84, 86). The prevalence of antibody to bat SARS- CoV in some species of Chinese horseshoe bats was as high as 84%. Pathology has not yet been associated with SARS- CoV infection of bats. The genomes of SARS-CoV isolates recovered from civets and humans during the 2002-to-2003 outbreak of SARS lay phylogenetically within the broad group of SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats (86). These data show that the virus responsible for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this group of bat-associated viruses. Antibody against SARS-CoV- like viruses of bats was also detected in Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia), a cave-dwelling megachiropteran, suggesting that fruit bats also may support infection with SARS-CoV-like viruses. Thus, the natural history of SARS- CoV appears to involve a previously unrecognized SARS- CoV-like virus of bats being transmitted in meat markets to amplifying hosts, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, and a hog badger, and then spilling over to infect humans in close contact with these intermediate hosts or their tissues. Subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus was associated with adaptive mutations in the viral genome (139). Ebola Viruses Five viruses have been placed in the taxon Filoviridae. Four of them (Ebola Zaire virus, Ebola Sudan virus, Ebola Ivory Coast virus, and Ebola Reston virus) comprise the genus Ebo- lavirus; Marburg virus comprises the genus Marburgvirus. The natural reservoir hosts of these viruses have not yet been iden- tified. However, Ebola virus RNA has been detected in terres- trial mammals in the Central African Republic (107). Experi- mental infections of the Angola free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus), little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus), and Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) with Ebola Zaire virus led to replication of virus in these bats (145). Recently, Ebola virus RNA was detected in liver and spleen tissues of three fruit bats: the hammer-headed fruit bat (Hyp- signathus monstrosus), Franquet’s epauletted bat (Epomops franqueti), and little collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata) (85). Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin M antibody was de- tected in bats of the same species, but Ebola virus RNA was not detected in bats with antibody, and antibody was not de- tected in bats with Ebola virus RNA. Detection of Ebola virus RNA in bats and rodents is a fascinating finding, as is detection of antibody. However, until and unless an Ebola virus (or Marburg virus) is isolated from a wild vertebrate, and experimental infections unambiguously demonstrate that the virus not only persists but is shed by that animal and that disease can be transmitted under controlled conditions, these findings will remain simply intriguing and promising. Monath has postulated that there may be an as-yet- undetected Ebola virus, one that is nonpathogenic but may give rise to pathogenic genotypes by mutation, and that the filoviruses may be arthropod or plant viruses (105). IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON EMERGING VIRUSES OF BATS AND OTHER WILDLIFE Emerging Viruses and Wildlife Surveillance Scores of newly recognized viruses have emerged in recent decades, and elegant reviews have brought into focus the con- tinuing importance of this phenomenon (91). It seems surpris- ing, as though we are caught unawares, when a hitherto un- recognized disease and its causative virus are discovered. Recognition of the spillover of a zoonotic virus is precipitated by human, livestock, or wildlife deaths, with considerable med- ical, emotional, and economic miseries. We wonder how such a virus could have evaded detection, why it had not been seen to cause disease before, and whether it is a “new” virus. When new emerging zoonotic viral diseases appear, reviews and grant applications are written, explanations proffered, symposia or- VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 539 ganized, and molecular and other specific diagnostic tools de- veloped. Unfortunately, one important method to predict emergence of zoonotic diseases that has been overlooked re- peatedly is the natural history survey, followed by targeted studies of species of interest identified through the survey. Survey research followed by targeted study has been used suc- cessfully to explore the epidemiology of reservoir host-zoo- notic virus maintenance, as exemplified by studies on hantavi- ruses in the southwestern United States (102, 103). These studies have helped epidemiologists and public health officials make recommendations to reduce the risk of infection and to help forecast the location and severity of future outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (22, 51, 52, 56). From about 1930 to about 1970, governments and private institutions emphasized sending people into the field to count, trap, measure, bleed, and test vertebrates and invertebrates for viruses. Although those surveys may not have provided answers directly and quickly, they did provide specimens for future analyses and questions to be addressed. Many “orphan” viruses without known connection to disease were discovered. Infor- mation regarding more than 500 viruses was collected by the American Committee on Arthropod-Borne Viruses and pub- lished in the International Catalogue of Arboviruses Including Certain Other Viruses (78). This invaluable but badly outdated compendium is slowly being replaced by Internet resources as a means of information dissemination. Supplementing and re- placing this printed catalogue are numerous databases (e.g., ICTVdB, The Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, available at http://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/). Nevertheless, most of the cur- rent data are limited in scope and in imagination. What is needed is a survey of viruses of all vertebrates, inverte- brates, plants, and other life forms. Although thoughts of complete surveys obviously are wishful thinking, some sur- vey efforts are better than none. Information about the natural history of most viruses in bats is limited. Regarding the conservation status of 914 bat species listed by Wilson (153), omitting those that are, or are suspected to be, extinct, 390 (42.7%) are considered not assessed (ade- quately), 297 are considered stable, 201 are considered vulner- able or potentially vulnerable, and 26 are considered endan- gered. Of the 390 species that have not been assessed adequately, 38 (9.7%) are of the family Pteropodidae, the Old World fruit bats, from which the most recent virus emergences have been observed. These 38 represent 59.4% of the 64 gen- era in this family, indicating that we know relatively little about the bats from which zoonotic viruses that cause human disease have recently emerged. To various degrees, this can be said about all bats, if not about all vertebrates. Obviously, there is a need for comprehensive surveys of bats in every place where they occur, although conservation con- cerns must be addressed in the design of survey and sampling methods, given that bats of many species are protected. Non- killing techniques involving bleeding or procuring of oropha- ryngeal and rectal swabs for PCR-based analyses, in addition to collection of recently dead individuals, have been used to determine viral infections and the prevalence of antibodies in bats (see, e.g., references 43, 114, and 115). We know very little about the 925 bat species that have been recognized, placed in a taxon, and largely ignored after that. How many unrecog- nized viruses do those bats harbor? Will any or all of these viruses eventually be shown to be human, livestock, or wildlife pathogens? What new viruses lurk in the other nearly 4,000 species of mammals and the thousands of species of other vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and individuals of other kingdoms, phyla, and classes? In effect, without even partial predictive capacity, we are simply waiting for the next disas- trous zoonotic virus outbreak to occur. Clearly, this is not an effective prevention or prediction philosophy. However, there is no simple solution to this need. Perhaps part of the problem is lack of interest (ignorance?), and part is due to lack of funding (there is not enough money for every- thing). Surely in some countries, principally those from which emerging disease are emerging, there is a lack of infrastruc- ture, manpower, and even national will; these are political questions. We suggest holding international symposia empha- sizing the importance of both natural history surveys and of knowledge as not only predictive tools but also disease-preven- tion tools. Further emphasis on greater prioritization of such studies might be shown to be very cost-effective in the long run. Virus Isolation and Characterization Virus isolation techniques and PCR assays now are ex- tremely sensitive and rapid. These methods could provide the opportunity to collect and store a massive amount of informa- tion to accompany bat sera and tissue specimens. This would provide us with at least some degree of intellectual prepared- ness and with reagents that could be used to develop rapid diagnostic assays for newly emerged viruses. When a newly recognized virus is detected, virus identifica- tion is now done by PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid, and the resulting sequence data are compared with sequences in the genetic databases, such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nih .gov/GenBank/), to search for similarities with sequences of recognized viruses. In addition, viral proteins (antigens) can be expressed and used for serodiagnostic tests. If possible, the infectious virus is isolated, antigens are prepared for diagnosis, and experimental infections are conducted to study pathogen- esis. Emerging viral diseases often are misdiagnosed. For ex- ample, when the Nipah virus infection was first reported in Malaysia in 1999, the diagnosis was “JEV infection,” even though (i) all the human patients were adult males, (ii) most or all of those people had been vaccinated against JEV, (iii) pigs suffered fatal disease (pigs do not die when infected with JEV; they serve as amplifying hosts for that virus), and (iv) a virus isolated from patients with the disease appeared by electron microscopy to be a paramyxovirus, not a flavivirus, as JEV is. Only after it was realized that an intensive JEV vaccination campaign was not diminishing transmission of this new disease were other approaches initiated; by then, valuable time and many lives had been lost. That outbreak can serve as an exam- ple of our perpetual following of epidemic curves rather than predicting them, of our lack of early recognition of emerging diseases. Diagnostic Limitations At this time, diagnostic reagents or tests are available for all the viruses shown in Table 2. However, to detect previously 540 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV. unrecognized viruses, new reagents and approaches must be developed or existing techniques applied. Among the new re- agents, a variety of nested primers useful for exploratory PCR might be formulated based on knowledge of sequences of recog- nized viruses within the order Mononegavirales (which includes Bornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae [120]). In addition, bat family-specific or genus-specific conjugates could be produced and applied for use in immunofluorescence assays or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to identify an- tibodies in sera or blood samples, or antigens in tissue samples. Classical methods including hemagglutination-inhibition tests, which are broadly cross-reactive, also could be developed using inactivated antigens prepared from various recognized viruses. Virus isolation assays, while potentially quite hazardous, also can be applied if used with appropriate biocontainment. In this day of increasing emphasis on molecular genetic tools for detecting viral nucleic acids and for identifying nucleotide sequences rather than the viruses themselves, it is frequently overlooked that virus iso- lation provides us with a virus. With the virus itself, many areas of research and development can be addressed, including develop- ment of diagnostics, of animal disease models, and of vaccines. Emphasis, sometimes complete emphasis, on nucleotide se- quence characterization rather than virus characterization has led us down a primrose path at the expense of having real viruses with which to work. Studies on Immune Responses of Bats To understand the innate and acquired immune responses of bats during acute and chronic virus infections, much additional research is needed. It will be necessary to develop bat cell culture-based assays and bat-specific reagents to examine lym- phocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine synthesis, cell- mediated immune responses, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats that are important reservoirs of emerging viruses. A major challenge in studying T-cell responses in bats is the apparent lack of inbred strains of bats. Such animals are needed for long-term T-cell studies because of the require- ment for matched major histocompatibility complex molecules on T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Colonies of captive bats might carry zoonotic viruses that could be transmitted to hu- mans, so research on the bats and their cells might require biological containment. In rodents, the growth factors required for in vitro expansion and maturation of bone marrow stem cells into competent antigen-presenting cells have been par- tially characterized, leading to development of cell culture assays for intermediate-term propagation of rodent T cells (41). Similar strategies likely can be employed for propagation of T cells from bats of various species. Molecular genetics should be useful for analyzing bat im- mune responses. More than 4,000 protein-encoding sequences from chiropterans are in the National Center for Biotechnol- ogy Information databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), but of these only sequences for recombination activation genes 1 and 2 are immunologically relevant. Despite this limitation, it should be possible to develop assays for evaluating such re- sponses in infected bats. Perhaps most tractable and meaning- ful for understanding these responses are analyses of cytokines and chemokines, especially in conjunction with cell culture assays. Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and flow cytometry-based assays for a number of cytokines and chemo- kines from conventional species have permitted an elegant dissection of immune responses in humans and rodents. How- ever, development of monoclonal antibody pairs for cytokine detection assays requires substantial funding and effort. More recent developments employing molecular approaches, such as real-time PCR, cDNA arrays, and RNase protection assays, have accelerated development assays for cytokine and chemo- kine gene expression. These assays will require sequencing of bat orthologs, but considering that 11 assemblies of mamma- lian genomes are already available, it is likely that most genes from bats of most species could be cloned and sequenced using degenerate PCR primer sets, a strategy that has been used for other species (132). Once the relevant gene sequences are known for bats of a given species, real-time PCR assays could be developed. In conjunction with cell culture studies, it should be possible to characterize bat immune responses to challenge with viral antigens. Bacterial artificial chromosome libraries are available for the little brown bat and the greater horseshoe bat, a species closely related to the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), a host for SARS-CoV-like virus (84; http://bacpac.chori.org/libraries.php). These resources may be particularly valuable for rapidly identifying immune response or cytokine genes of interest by using human or mouse hybrid- ization probes. Immune Evasion and Virus Persistence Viruses must evade the host immune response for a time sufficient to allow transmission to other susceptible hosts or to establish persistent infection. The strategies employed by vi- ruses are numerous and target both the innate and adaptive phases of the immune response. Some commonly employed evasion strategies include virus-encoded immune-modulating cytokines, decoy soluble cytokine receptors, inhibitors of apop- tosis and cellular signaling, inhibitors of antigen processing, and T-cell antagonists (2, 3, 18, 61, 70, 79, 87, 104, 150, 152). To persist, viruses must also become biochemically adapted, so that they can replicate without severely compromising the host’s survival. Some viruses, including SARS-CoV, elicit an immune re- sponse in the nonreservoir host that may contribute to pathol- ogy (75, 148, 157) while apparently, at least for SARS viruses, not causing immunopathology in the reservoir. Elucidating the immune responses in reservoir hosts that determine the bal- ance between virus persistence and immunopathology could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis in hu- mans and reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Some paramyxoviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses, encode V proteins that bind to signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 proteins of host cells to block both alpha/beta and gamma interferon responses (122). How the viral proteins might affect potential interferon re- sponses to virus infections in bats is unknown. Possibly the V proteins play a role in viral persistence and evasion of the immune response. Addressing these important issues regard- ing the pathophysiology of viral infections in bats will require the development of infection models for reservoir species of each zoonotic virus. With regard to bats, there is evidence that “healthy bats” can VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 541 be asymptomatically infected with rabies virus. In nonlethal rabies infections produced in Mexican free-tailed bats, individ- uals surviving infection do not have virus in the brain or saliva. In one experimental study of free-tailed bats inoculated with salivary gland tissues from naturally infected bats, the incuba- tion periods were 24 to 125 days, but one asymptomatic bat sacrificed at the end of the study had rabies virus in the brain, salivary glands, and other organs (11). Incubation periods for rabies virus are certainly highly variable in bats, and persis- tence of virus in hibernating bats has been suggested as serving a viral reservoir function (143). A carrier state for rabies virus has also been suggested by experimental and observational studies among dogs in Ethiopia (48). Discovery of Emerging Viruses in Wildlife It is, perhaps, instructive that viruses of the families Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Bornaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae are phylogenetically related and have been grouped in a single order, the Mononegavirales (120). There are at least 250 rec- ognized viruses in this order, including some that infect hu- mans, other primates, livestock, birds, dogs, seals, fish, crabs, mosquitoes, ticks, amoebae, plants, or bats. If there is an un- recognized tendency for bats and viruses to be associated, viruses of this order would be prime targets for beginning the search. Essentially every living life form investigated has been shown to host viruses, and bats are no exception. However, it is rea- sonable to query the roles of viruses of bats. What role, for example, does a fruit-eating bat play in the life cycle of a human or livestock pathogen? If human and livestock infec- tions from bats simply are host-switching phenomena, why have these viruses not been recognized previously, and why have they emerged now? Are these events the results of eco- logic alterations, such as impingement of human activities on heretofore virgin areas, consequences of global climate change, or the product of improved surveillance activities co- incident with the technical advances in diagnostic capabilities required to identify heretofore undescribed zoonotic viruses? Are viruses of bats symbionts, parasites, or commensals? Is pathogenicity for humans and livestock simply a freak occur- rence? Perhaps these emerging bat viruses are naturally trans- mitted by arthropods or by other potential vectors that have not been examined. Surely a fatal infection in a host is not in the long-term best interest of the virus. Might fruit-eating bats transmit viruses to or from plants? How? Are insectivorous bats intermediate hosts between insects and vertebrates (or plants)? Are fruiting events part of periodic amplification cy- cles of viruses from frugivorous bats to wildlife and humans, as suggested by Dobson (42)? Childs summarized the processes by which zoonotic viruses are transmitted (29). He noted the rarity of surveillance for wildlife diseases or infections and suggested that such studies usually are outbreak-driven, i.e., after an epidemic of a newly recognized virus has emerged. Outbreaks of Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus, SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats, and European bat lyssavirus 1 (108) have not been recognized more than once or a few times. Are transmissions between bats and other vertebrates infre- quent, incidental spillover events? Do many of the 66 viruses listed in Table 2 represent fortuitous, irrelevant events, or have we detected only the tip of the iceberg? Do bats differ from other mammals in their ability to clear viral infections? Does the persistence of asymptomatic viral infections in bats indicate that bats are an important reservoir for the wide variety of viruses in nature? Is the prevalence of RNA viruses in persis- tent infections in bats indicative of a defect in host resistance or viral clearance mechanisms, such as interferon or interferon- responsive genes that lead to clearance of RNA viruses from other vertebrates? There is some urgency to explore these impor- tant questions. There is no reason to believe that bats are different from other mammals with regard to species specificity of host sus- ceptibility to virus diseases, nonuniform persistence of viral infections, or mechanisms of virus shedding, so that such in- vestigations likely do not require development of new assay systems or diagnostic concepts. Additional research is needed to determine the roles played by bats of various species in the natural histories of the viruses for which bats can serve as hosts. One or more of the 66 viruses listed in Table 2 have been isolated from bats of 74 species. As well, viruses have been isolated from bats not identified further than to genus level and from four unidentified bats. Some viruses have been isolated from bats of as few as 1 species and one from as many as 14. Clearly, bat handlers, people entering bat habitat areas, and people who usually think in noninfectious disease terms re- garding various studies of the bats themselves should take necessary precautions to avoid exposing themselves to recog- nized and unrecognized viruses and to other human pathogens which the bats may harbor.

We captured 161 rodents inside private residences, using Sherman traps, including 86 house mice (Mus musculus) and 75 black rats (Rattus rattus). Serum from each animal was assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using two vertebrate-specific flaviviruses (Apoi and Modoc viruses) and five mosquito-borne flaviviruses (dengue 2, dengue 4, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses). Sixty-one (37.9%) rodents had anti‐ bodies that neutralized at least one virus. Prevalences for flaviviruses were 64.0% and 15.1% for black rats and house mice, res‐ pectively. None of the PRNT90 titers exceeded 80, and often they were highest for Modoc virus. These data suggest that a subset of rodents had been infected with Modoc virus or a closely related flavivirus that was not included in the PRNT analysis. Key words: Flavivirus, Mexico, Modoc vi- rus, rodents, surveillance. Rodents often live in urban environments in proximity to humans, causing serious implications for public health (Meerburg et al. 2009). Many zoonotic viruses have rodents as reservoir hosts, and rodent-borne zoonotic viruses of particular concern in- clude those in the genera Hantavirus (e.g., Hantaan and Sin Nombre viruses), Arena- virus (e.g., Lassa virus), and Alphavirus (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus). Several human pathogens in the genus Flavivirus have rodents as reservoir hosts including tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe and Asia (Mansfield et al. 2009), Powassan virus in the northeastern US, Canada, and Russia (Ebel 2010), and Kyasa- nur Forest disease virus in Asia (Hol- brook 2012). There is limited information on the prev- alence of flaviviruses in rodents in Mexico despite the enormous burden that these viruses place on human health. Of particu- lar concern is dengue virus (DENV), which is distributed throughout Mexico and causes large outbreaks of dengue fever and life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever each year (Tapia-Conyer et al. 2012). Dengue virus is primarily main- tained in a primate-mosquito transmission cycle, but detection of DENV RNA in wild rodents, marsupials, and bats suggests that nonprimates may occasionally serve as reservoir hosts (de Thoisy et al. 2009). West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis en- cephalitis virus (SLEV) are also human pathogens that occur in Mexico (Farfan- Ale et al. 2006). Both are primarily main- tained in bird-mosquito transmission cycles although evidence suggests that some ro- dent species are competent reservoirs for WNV (Platt et al. 2008). We determined the prevalence of DENV, WNV, SLEV, and select other flaviviruses in small, peri- domestic rodents in Merida, the largest city on the Yucatan Peninsula. Rodents were trapped inside 20 houses in a 92-km2 area of Merida. Trapping was performed at each house for three consec- utive nights each month, October 2011– September 2012. Twelve traps were placed each night. Each house had a cement floor and roof, cement walls, a small backyard, potable water and electricity, and most had screened windows. All houses were within 100 m of vacant lots that contained a large amount of domestic trash or veg‐ etation. Rodents were captured using 168 DOI: 10.7589/2015-05-116 Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 52(1), 2016, pp. 168–172 # Wildlife Disease Association 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis mailto:carmachain@gmail.com Sherman traps (839323 cm, H. B. Sher- man Traps Inc., Tallahassee, Florida, USA) baited with oats and sunflower seeds. Trapping was performed with permission of the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (permit 31D8B- 01373/1305). Captured rodents were eu- thanized by CO2 inhalation and identified to species and sex using morphologic keys (Emmons 1990; Reid 2009). Blood was col- lected from each animal by cardiac punc- ture, dispensed into VacutainerH tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA), placed on wet ice, and trans- ported to the laboratory. Samples were microfuged and supernatants were collect- ed and stored at −80 C. Animals were han- dled in accordance to protocols approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. All animals appeared healthy at the time of capture. Sera were assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) following stan- dard protocols (Beaty et al. 1995). The PRNTs were performed using five mos- quito-borne flaviviruses: DENV-2 (strain NGC), DENV-4 (strain 241), SLEV (strain TBH-28), WNV (strain NY99-35261-11), and yellow fever virus (YFV; strain YF- 17D) as well as two rodent-associated flavi- viruses that have no known arthropod vec- tor (NKV): Modoc virus (MODV; strain M544) and Apoi virus (APOIV, strain origi- nal). Although YFV and APOIV are not known to occur in Mexico, they were in- cluded in the PRNTs to detect antibodies to unrecognized YFV- and APOIV-like viruses that may be circulating in the area. We selected an antigenically diverse group of flaviviruses to reduce the likelihood of flavivirus-specific antibodies remaining un‐ detected. We obtained DENV-2, DENV- 4, SLEV, andWNV from theWorld Health Organization Center for Arbovirus Refer- ence and Research at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado, US; YFV, MODV, and APOIV were obtained from the World Arbovirus Reference Collection at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Gal- veston, Texas, US. The PRNTs were per- formed in 6-well plates using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera were tested at a starting dilution of 1:20. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilutions yielding $90% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT90). We captured 161 rodents of two species; 86 housemice (Musmusculus) and 75 black rats (Rattus rattus). Thirteen (15%) house mice and 48 (64%) black rats were PRNT- positive for flavivirus. Sixty-one (37.9%) rodents had antibodies that neutralized at least one virus. The PRNT90 titers for the positive black rats were usually highest for MODV although no titers exceeded 80 (Ta- ble 1). Twenty-five rats had MODV PRNT90 titers of 20, eight had titers of 40, and two had titers of 80. The two rats with titers of 80 (R-35 and R-77) could be con- sidered seropositive for MODV because these titers are at least fourfold greater than that of the other viruses tested. How- ever, because a PRNT90 titer of 80 is not particularly high and because all other positive rats had antibodies to an undeter- mined flavivirus, these two animals were assigned the conservative diagnosis of “seropositive for MODV or a MODV-like virus” to avoid potential misdiagnosis. All of the positive house mice had antibodies to an undetermined flavivirus (Table 2). None of their PRNT90 titers exceeded 40. Our data indicate that flaviviruses are a cause of infection in two species of peri- domestic rodents in Merida. In most instances, the flavivirus(es) responsible for these infections were not identified. Most of the positive rodents were black rats and often their PRNT90 titers were highest for MODV. However, because all of the titers were relatively low, it is likely that these animals were infected with a MODV-like virus that was not included in the PRNTs. The etiologic agent could be Cowbone Ridge virus, Jutiapa virus (JUTV), Sal Vieja virus (SVV), or San Perlita virus (SPV). All of these are NKV flaviviruses that belong to the Modoc serogroup and are known to SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 169 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis occur in the Americas. Cowbone Ridge virus, SPV, and JUTV have been isolated from cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in Florida, Texas, andGuatemala, respectively, while SVV was isolated from a white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) in Texas, al- though none of these viruses have been reported in Mexico (Centers for Disease TABLE 1.

These viruses were not in- cluded in the PRNTs because they did not form distinct plaques in any of the cell lines that we tested (Vero, BHK-21, and LLM- CK2). Another explanation is that a subset of positive rats had been infected with MODV but high antibody titers were not generated because the virus replicates poor- ly in some species of rodents. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) experimentally infected with MODV produced low anti- body titers when analyzed by serum dilution neutralization tests; none had titers .40 (Davis and Hardy 1973). Flavivirus-neutral- izing antibody titers steadily decline over time, so another explanation is that some of the positive rats had been infected with MODV, but none of the infections were re- cent. As observed with the black rats, all of the positive house mice had low PRNT90 titers. None of the house mice had PRNT90 titers .40, and usually their titers were higher for the mosquito-borne flaviviruses than for the NKV flaviviruses. Explanations for these findings include: 1) a subset of pos- itive mice had been infected with one or more of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses in- cluded in the PRNTs, but none of the infec- tions were recent, 2) a subset of positive mice may have been exposed to another, perhaps unrecognized, mosquito-borne fla- vivirus that was not included in the PRNTs, and 3) the etiologic agent was not identified because some of the positive mice and rats had been exposed to more than one fla‐ vivirus. However, previous studies have demonstrated that rodents sequentially challenged with heterologous flaviviruses develop high antibody titers (Tesh et al. 2002). Anecdotal evidence suggests that MODV was a cause of aseptic meningitis in a young boy who had handled a sick mouse (Davis and Hardy 1973). Direct con- tact with virus-contaminated rodent urine could be a mechanism by which MODV (and potentially MODV-like viruses) are transmitted to humans. Experimental stud- ies have shown that MODV is chronically shed in urine of golden hamsters (Mesocri- cetus auratus) for several months (Adams et al. 2013). Modoc virus was also detected in urine of experimentally infected deer mice for up to 6 d (Davis et al. 1974). Other serologic investigations have pro- vided evidence of flavivirus exposure in small rodents. Antibodies to flaviviruses were detected by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 10 of 19 (53%) house mice, 17 of 41 (41%) deer TABLE 2.

SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 171 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis mice, 4 of 13 (31%) western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis), and 1 of 15 (2%) Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in the central and eastern US in 2003 (Root et al. 2005). Flavivirus-specific antibodies were detected by blocking ELISA in nine of 215 (4%) deer mice in Iowa in 2005–07 (Blitvich et al. 2009). Taken together, our data and previous studies indicate that the presence of antibodies to flaviviruses in small North American rodents is not un- common. With increasing urbanization and the continual emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens, it is likely that peridomestic rodents will have an increasingly important role in zoonotic disease transmission. We thank the research staff in the Arbo- virology Laboratory at the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán for assisting with fieldwork and the homeowners for gener- ously allowing us to collect rodents inside their homes.

Unlike other ar- boviruses, wild mammals have no confirmed role in the cycle of dengue in the neotropics, although serologi- cal studies have suggested a possible secondary amplification cycle involving mammals other than nonhuman primates. In French Guiana, where all four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) are present, the disease is endemic with outbreak events. To determine whether wild mammals can be infected by DENV, ro- dents, marsupials, and bats were captured over several periods, from 2001 to 2007, at two sites. The first loca- tion is a secondary forest surrounded by an urban area where dengue is endemic. The second location is a for- est edge site where the disease has not yet emerged. A total of 10,000 trap-nights were performed and 616 mammals were captured. RNAs representing the four DENV serotypes were detected at both sites by reverse- transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the livers and/or sera of 92 mammals belonging to 14 out of 32 species distributed among all the orders investigated: Rodentia (33 positive/146 tested), Marsupialia (40/318), and Chiroptera (19/152). Sequence analyses of a portion of the capsid and premembrane junction revealed that mammal strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 had only 92.6%, 89%, 95%, and 95.8% identity, respectively, with strains circulating in the human population during the same periods. Regarding DENV-2, strains related (99% identity) to those responsible for an epidemic event in humans in French Guiana concur- rent to the capture sessions were also evidenced, suggesting that wild mammals in edge habitats can be in- fected by circulating human strains. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that neotropical wild mammals can be infected with dengue virus. The question of whether mammals maintain DENV in enzootic cycles and can play a role in its reemergence in human populations remains to be answered. Key Words: Dengue virus; wild mammals; South America; periurban areas. 157 Introduction DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) BELONGS to the Flaviviridae familyand has been responsible for major epidemics in the tropics since the 17th century (Gubler 2001). Its associated disease manifestations (dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome) are caused by four vi- ral serotypes designated DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 that are widespread in the tropics throughout the world with significant public health and economic impacts. Indeed, with respect to both morbidity and mortality, dengue is the arbovirus with the highest incidence in hu- mans (an estimated 80–100 million infections are reported each year), with exponentially increasing occurrence (Weaver and Barrett 2004) and expanding distribution (Solomon and Mallewa 2001). The extent of epidemic events has been increasing due to several factors: the increase in hu- man population densities and movements worldwide, 1Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana. 2Molecular Virology and Surveillance Laboratory, CDC Dengue Branch, San Juan, Puerto Rico. 3Laboratoire Population Environnement, UMR-151 Université de Provence-IRD, Université de Provence, Marseille, France. 4Association Kwata, Cayenne, French Guiana. 5Laboratoire de Paléontologie, Paléobiologie et Phylogénie, Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution, UMR 5554, Université de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France. 6Département de Rétrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Franceville, Gabon. 7Laboratoire de Virologie, Centre National de Référence des Arbovirus et Virus Influenza, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne cedex, French Guiana. 8Unidad de Investigación Medica en Immunologiá, Coordinación de Investigación, Instituto del Seguro Social, CMN Siglo XXI, Hospital de Pediatría, Mexico, D.F. 9Département de Virologie, Institut de Médecine Tropicale du Service de Santé des Armées, Armées, France.

Up until now, factors regulating dengue outbreaks have mainly been related to the ecology of vec- tors, including seasonal variation of densities, relative abun- dance of infective females, daily survival rates (Kuno 1997), immune status of human hosts (Halstead 2007), and possi- bly their genetic background (Rico-Hesse 2003). Unlike most of the other arboviruses, dengue virus pos- sesses a unique human-to-human cycle, without the need for an intermediary wild mammalian reservoir (Rodhain 1991, Monath 1994). In Africa, Asia, and possibly in the Philip- pines, the virus nevertheless has, together with the human urban cycle, a sylvatic cycle, most likely involving nonhu- man primates as reservoirs (Fagbami et al. 1977, Inoue et al. 2003). Serological investigations in mammals suggest that the circulation of dengue follows epidemiological patterns, with- out detectable clinical signs in hosts (Saluzzo et al. 1986a, de Silva et al. 1999). The oscillating nature of cycles (Diallo et al. 2003) can suggest that herd immunity of nonhuman pri- mates and/or possibly other mammalian hosts regulates vi- ral amplifications, but so far, wild mammals have no dem- onstrated role in the dengue virus emergence processes in humans. Indeed, sylvatic dengue strains are genetically and ecologically distinct from urban ones. Nevertheless, though epidemic events are induced by nonsylvatic strains (Rico- Hesse 1990), sylvatic strains can induce characteristic febrile syndromes in West Africa (Carey et al. 1971, Saluzzo et al. 1986b) and limited epidemics in urban settings (Vasilakis et al. 2008). Sylvatic cycles have not been recognized in South America (Hayes et al. 1996, Scott 2001), in agreement with the supposed recent introduction of dengue in the New World due to hu- man population flows during the colonization and slave trade periods, a scheme supported by both genetic variability (Gaunt et al. 2001) and historical records (Christie 1881, Stead- man 1828). Two serological studies in remote forest Amerindian communities nevertheless led to divergent results with regard to the potential sylvatic circulation of DENV (Roberts et al. 1984, Valero et al. 2004). These discrepancies can be explained by virus divergence that may have led to technical difficulties in the detection of dengue viral infection by commonly used serological markers. Investigations on dengue sylvatic strains in wild mammals have also led to con- tradictory conclusions. Following the negative results ob- tained in serological investigations (Rosen 1958, Karesh et al. 1998, Contigiani et al. 2000), other works have shown indirect evidence of dengue virus infection in mammals. In Central America, antibodies that neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 were detected in 20% of tested bats, while in Ecuador 30% of bats had neutralizing antibodies for DENV-2 and/or DENV- 3 (Platt et al. 2000). In French Guiana, neutralizing antibodies for DENV-2 virus were also detected in the sera of rodents, bats, marsupials, ungulates, and xenarthres (de Thoisy et al. 2004). But, because these neutralizing titers were generally low, they could have been induced by other flaviviruses. Nev- ertheless, DENV is presumed to make its own antigenic com- plex within the Flaviviridae (Calisher et al. 1989). On the basis of these studies, a strictly sylvatic dengue circulation can therefore not be excluded. To resolve these questions, we investigated the presence of dengue virus in wild mammal fauna in areas of French Guiana, using molecular tools, where dengue is endemic, with outbreaks of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 reported since 1991. Only DENV-4 has been detected sporadically (Dussart et al. 2006). Two distinct sites were targeted. The first was near the city of Cayenne, where all four dengue serotypes circulate. There, we monitored fauna over a 6-year period, during and between dengue epidemics, to gain in- sights into the susceptibility of free-ranging mammals pres- ent close to human settlements to infection with DENV and the possibility that they can maintain a continuous trans- mission cycle in the wild. A second site was chosen in a rural location where DENV is practically absent. This area is un- dergoing rapid development, with the construction of roads and the establishment of new human settlements. It was thus of twofold interest. First, it would allow us to investigate po- tential occurrence of sylvatic circulation. Second, as dengue emergence events are expected to be related to environ- mental disturbances, a long-term study site would be valu- able to evaluate potential movements of DENV from humans to mammals and conversely. Materials and Methods Sites and trapping French Guiana is a French overseas department on the northeast coast of the South American continent, between Brazil and Suriname (4°N 53°W). Ninety percent of its sur- face area of 89,000 km2 FD is tropical rain forest; the re- maining 10%, situated in the northern part of the country, is coastal plain, where 90% of the 200,000 inhabitants live. The main urban center is Cayenne, with a total of 100,000 in- habitants. The diurnal temperature in the country varies from 28°C to 30°C. The dry season occurs from August to November with a short dry period in March (50 to 150 mm rain/month) and the rainy season lasts throughout the re- mainder of the year (200 to 600 mm rain/month). Animals (bats, terrestrial and arboreal rodents, and mar- supials) were captured at two different sites. The first, known as “le Camp du Tigre” (CT), is a secondary forest fragment of about 100 hectares located in a periurban area near Cayenne, where dengue is endemic. Seven trapping periods were implemented: in March 2001, and in the months of May (rainy season) and October (dry season) 2005, 2006, and 2007. The site is surrounded by urban areas and has a low diver- sity of mammalian fauna, including small monkeys (squir- rel monkeys, golden-handed tamarins), sloths, rodents, mar- supials, and bats. The second site, “Saint Georges de l’Oyapock” (SG), is located near the Brazilian border and has a low human population. This trapping site is located be- tween the edge of a primary forest and a rural area. Three trapping periods were carried out there in November 2006 and in June and November 2007. At each site, 20 to 30 trap stations were used to capture nonflying mammals. Each station included one Tomahawk trap (50 � 18 � 18 cm; Tomahawk Live Trap Co., Toma- hawk, WI) on the ground and 2 BTTm traps (33 � 11 � 10 cm; BTTm, Besançon Trap Service mécanique, France) or one BTTm and one Sherman trap (23 � 9 � 8 cm; Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, FL), with one trap being placed on the ground and the other in trees between 1 and 3 m in height. Traps were baited with apples and/or peanut butter for 15 to 21 consecutive nights and checked every morning.

A total of 418 mammals of the orders Rodentia and Marsupialia were captured at CT, and 46 were captured at SG (Table 1). In addition, 125 and 27 bats representing 14 species were captured at CT and SG, re- spectively, during the same periods on 2 to 4 consecutive nights using capture mistnets (12 � 2.40 m, 16-mm mesh; La- vorazione Reti, Monte Isola, BS Italy). Captured animals were brought back to the laboratory, identified using external morphological characteristics (Em- mons and Feer 1997), and their age and sex were determined. They were euthanized with pentobarbital (Dolethal©, Véto- quinol, Lure, France) after chemical anesthesia (ketamine 10 mg/kg � xylazine 1 mg/kg) under veterinary supervision. Blood and liver samples were collected aseptically and pre- served at �80°C for later use. Detection of dengue viral RNA in sera and liver samples by reverse-transcriptate polymerase chain reaction RNA was extracted from sera and liver tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, Refrewshire, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was re- verse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer oligonu- cleotides (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Promega, Madison, WI). Primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions were used following Lanciotti et al. (1992). cDNA (4 �L) was then used for the seminested PCR: During the first run of PCR, primers D1 and D2 were used to amplify a fragment of 511 bp corresponding to a portion of the capsid and premembrane (C/prM) genes. The second amplification run corresponds to a seminested PCR using primers D1 and TS1-TS2-TS3-TS4. Each of the last four primers is serotype specific, generating PCR products of different sizes (482 bp for DENV-1, 119 bp for DENV-2, 290 bp for DENV-3, and 392 bp for DENV-4). For each experiment and at every step, all the necessary controls were carried out to confirm that contamination did not occur. After serotype identification of positive animals, the first RT-PCR products were then used for another seminested PCR amplification using D1 and one of the newly designed primers to obtain longer amplification products (Table 2). The amplification was carried out as follows: an initial denatu- ration at 94°C for 5 min, then 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final incubation at 72°C for 10 min. The obtained PCR products were then di- rectly sequenced using the amplification primers. Sequenc- ing was carried out with an automatic sequence analyzer (ABI PRISM 3700, Applera, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DENV PCR products obtained from humans (CNR des Arbovirus et Virus Influenza, Insti- tut Pasteur de la Guyane) during contemporary periods were sequenced using the same primer pairs. Sequences were then aligned with other previously published sequences of dengue virus using MEGA software and alignments were checked manually. Database searches using the BLAST web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) were performed to identify the most closely related strains to those obtained from wild mammals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PAUP*4.0b8 (Swofford 1998). The MODELTEST 3.7 program (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to determine the optimal model of nucleotide evolution for the dataset, which was then applied for distance and maximum likelihood analyses. The resul- tant topology was examined by bootstrapping. One thou- sand iterations were performed for distance analyses and 100 replicates for maximum likelihood analyses. In addition, a Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1.0 (Ron- quist and Huelsenbeck 2003) to infer phylogenetic relation- ships. Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations were run for 1,000,000 generations, with six simultaneous chains, using a sample frequency of 100 and a burn-in of 100,000. Default settings for the prior probabilities of the model parameters (GTR��4) were used. Results Detection of dengue virus RNA in mammals A total of 569 livers and 560 sera collected from 616 cap- tured mammals were tested for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR. Dengue viral RNA representing the four serotypes was detected in samples from both collecting sites for a total of 92 mammals (Table 1). At the CT site, 16% (87/543) of the animals were infected; the distribution of DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 at this site was 41% (36/87), 20%, 33%, and 6% respectively. The distribution of DENV positive mammals by order was: Chiroptera 4% (19/543), Rodentia 5%, and Marsupialia 7%. At the SG site, only 7% (5/72) of the mammals, representing a single rodent species (Proechimys cuvieri) and trapped during a single session, were positive; they represented the DENV-3 serotype: 4% (3/72) and the DENV-4 serotype: 3% (2/72). Sequence analyses and phylogenetic investigations At least one C/prM sequence was obtained for each serotype from mammals collected in 2006 and 2007. These sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers EU518594–EU518605, EU522110, and EU642553. One sequence was obtained from DENV-1 RNA detected in one bat (Carollia perspicillata) captured in May 2007 at CT (accession number: EU518594). BLAST database searches of the obtained sequence revealed that the DENV-1 Mochizuki strain detected in Japan in 1943 is the most closely related strain with 97.3% identity (419 bp analyzed). Furthermore, the DENV-1 strain circulating in humans in French Guiana (EU518605) during the same period presents a lesser degree of identity (92.6%; Table 3). Phylogenetic analyses show that the major genotypes of DENV-1 (genotypes IV and V) are supported with high bootstrap values with the exception of genotype I (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic reconstruction confirms that the D1 C0558 bat French Guiana 2007 sequence is closely related to the Japanese DENV-1 Mochizuchi strain with high bootstrap values (80% in distance, 64% in maximum likelihood [ML], 76% in Bayesian analysis) and belongs to genotype I. In contrast, the DENV-1 strain identified in French Guiana in the human population at a contemporary period belongs to genotype V composed of American and Asian strains. Four sequences were obtained from DENV-2 RNA de- tected in four mammals captured in 2006 at CT. These se- quences reveal two distinct groups. The first two sequences (EU518601 and EU518602) were detected with DENV-2 RNA DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 159 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 3/ 04 /1 9.

BLAST database searches revealed that they share approximately 95% identity (390 bp analyzed) with a strain isolated in In- dia in 2001 (Table 3). Comparison with a human sequence obtained in French Guiana during the same period reveals approximately 89% identity (Table 2). The two other se- quences (EU518603 and EU518604) were obtained from DENV-2 RNA detected in two Marmosa murina (Marsupialia) and are most closely related to a sequence detected in the Dominican Republic in 2001 with which identities vary be- tween 99.2 and 99.7%. They are also closely related to the DENV human sequence obtained in French Guiana at the same period (98.7 and 99.2% similarity; Table 2). Phylogenetic analyses performed on these sequences with other representative strains enabled the five major DENV-2 lineages to be identified on the basis of consistent topologi- cal associations. Nevertheless, although the Asian, Ameri- can-Asian, American, and sylvatic lineages are supported with high bootstrap values, the cosmopolitan lineage is less supported and divided into two clades that are supported with high bootstrap values (Fig. 2). The DENV-2 sequences identified in mammals segregated into two distinct clusters. Two strains (D2 B1004 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D2 B1010 Marsupial French Guiana 2006) were related with high bootstrap values (81% in distance, 78% in ML, 100% in Bayesian analysis) to an urban strain circulating in French Guiana during the same period, and to strains identified in the Dominican Republic in 2001 (Fig. 2). These sequences are included in the American-Asian genotype that is well sup- ported (93% in distance, 96% in ML, 100% in Bayesian anal- ysis). The two other sequences (D2 B1015 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D2 B1032 Marsupial French Guiana 2006) are located at the base of the Native American lineage. This association is also well supported (87% in distance, 69% in ML, 98% in Bayesian analysis). Three sequences were obtained from DENV-3 RNA ex- tracted from three mammals: two in Marmosa murina (Mar- supialia) captured at CT in October 2006 and 2007 (EU518599 and EU518598, respectively) and one in Procchimys cuvieri (Rodentia) captured at SG in November 2006 (EU518600). These three sequences are closely related to each other and to a strain identified in Brazil in 2002 as well as to the H87 strain isolated in the Philippines in 1956. They show from 99.7 to 100% identity (on a 364 bp fragment) with these se- quences. Comparison of the three nucleotide sequences with the nucleotide sequence representing a human DENV-3 iso- lated in French Guiana during the same period shows ap- proximately 95% identity (Table 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that the three se- quences detected in mammals (D3 B1018 Marsupial French Guiana 2006, D3 C1034 Marsupial French Guiana 2007, and D3 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are related with high bootstrap values (99% in distance, 97% in ML, 100% in Bayesian analysis) to strains isolated in the Philippines in 1956, in China in 1980, and in Brazil in 2002. These sequences cluster together and belong to genotype V (Fig. 3). The hu- man strain circulating in French Guiana at a contemporary period belongs to genotype III composed of strains from Cen- tral and South America, Africa, Asia, and the West Indies (Fig. 3). Two sequences were obtained from DENV-4 RNA de- tected in a marsupial Didelphis marsupialis (EU518596) and a rodent Procchimys cuvieri (EU518595), which were trapped in 2006. The C/prM sequence is identical to a strain isolated in 2001 in Peru and is closely related to the H241 strain isolated in 1956 in the Philippines (AY947539) with 99.5% identity (360 bp analyzed; Table 2). Finally, they share 95.8% iden- tity with a strain observed in French Guiana (EU522110) in 2005. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that the mam- malian strains (D4 B1008 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and D4 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are associated with strains isolated in the Philippines in 1956 and 1995, in Peru (2001), and in Brazil (2006). This group of sequences belongs to genotype I, which is not well supported (Fig. 4). In con- trast, the only DENV-4 strain isolated in humans in French Guiana in 2005 belongs, together with other South Ameri- can and West Indian strains, to genotype II. Discussion In the New World, unlike in the Old World, the commonly held belief is that dengue infection is absent in the fauna. Af- ter recent evidences of positive seroneutralization in wild fauna, we identified viral RNA in many species of South American bats, rodents, and marsupials, and we provide the first C/prM sequences of strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 circulating in animal communities. These results were found repeatedly both in an endemic area where all four serotypes circulate in the adjacent human pop- ulations (Fig. 5) and in an area where the disease is nearly DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 161 TABLE 2.

DENGUE INFECTION IN WILD MAMMALS 163 FIG. 1. Phylogenetic Analysis of DENV-1 Isolates. The phylogenetic tree was derived from the partial nucleotide sequences of the C/prM genes (419 bp excluding primers) of representative strains belonging to the major lineages of DENV-1 (as designated by Goncalvez et al., 2002) using Distances, Maximum Likelihood (ML) (PAUP, version 4.10), and Bayesian analy- ses (1,000,000 replicates, MrBayes, version 3.1b). The following ML parameters corresponding to the TrN � G model were used: Nucleotide frequencies were estimated to be as follows: A � 0.3098, C � 0.1997, G � 0.2389, T � 0.2515. The –lnL value was 1816.49. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution was estimated to be 0.2005. The tree was rooted on the strains belonging to genotype IV. Support for nodes was provided by bootstrapping and the posterior probabilities of the corresponding clades (i.e. 1000 and 100 replicates under distances and ML (in normal and boldface type respectively) and under Bayesian analyses (in italics and underlined).

These findings suggest either spillover infections from humans to mammals or a possible enzootic cycle in- volving mammals. DENV sequences obtained from mam- mals led to the development of two plausible scenarios. First, on the basis of C/prM sequences, most of the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 strains obtained from wild mammals were divergent from those circulating in the surrounding human populations during the same periods. The strains identified in the wild mammalian fauna were found, at dif- ferent periods, in periurban areas and in forest areas, where human contacts are limited. This suggests that DENV in- fection of wild mammals and its circulation in mammal communities are widespread, which eliminates the possi- bility that our positive results could be related to inciden- tal, local, and/or time-restricted epiphenomena. Neverthe- less, some authors have already recorded such divergent strains and attributed them to laboratory contamination (Rico-Hesse 2003). Although laboratory contamination can- DE THOISY ET AL.164 FIG. 2. Phylogenetic Analysis of DENV-2 Isolates.

Indeed, none of the strains closely related to the ones we identified in the fauna, with the exception of the H87 DENV-3 strain, have been han- dled in our institution. Furthermore, viral RNAs were ex- tracted and amplified right after the collection of the sam- ples, and the different mammal dengue strains were identified repeatedly. Our data thus strongly suggest a for- est circulation of all four serotypes of DENV, but conclu- sive evidence will only be supported by isolating DENV from forest-dwelling mosquitoes. Moreover, although the relatedness of the mammalian strains to the human ones is only based on a 400 bp anal- ysis, DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4 strains are related to Asian strains that were isolated decades ago. The origin of these strains in South American fauna thus remains highly questionable. It could be explained either by the history of dengue dispersal during the 17th and 18th centuries (Due- nas 1909), or by its introduction by Asian migrants in the first half of the 20th century (Rico-Hesse 2003). Then, mam- mals could have maintained these strains and, under the right conditions (vector pullulation, environmental distur- bances), these strains could have escaped from mammals and circulated at low levels among human populations. For instance, recent DENV-4 strains isolated in humans in Brazil in 2005 and 2006 cluster with the mammalian strains we describe here (Pinto de Figueiredo et al. 2008). In the same way, some DENV-3 strains detected in Brazil in 2002 (EF629370) and during epidemics that occurred there from 2002 to 2004 (Figueiredo et al. 2008) belong to genotype I and are closely related to the ones we detected in mam- mals in French Guiana.

Generating the complete en- velope gene sequences should enable us to support or re- fute this scenario. Secondly, the D2 B1004 20066 and D2 B1010 2006 se- quences support the notion that fauna can also be infected by strains circulating in surrounding human populations. In fact, DENV-2 caused an epidemic in French Guiana from Jan- uary to September 2006, and the two strains identified in two Marmosa murina (marsupialia) in October 2006 are related to the ones responsible for that epidemic. This strongly sug- gests that under the pressure of a strong epidemic event, ur- ban strains could enter the forest and then infect the fauna. Such transmission, facilitated by hunting, logging, or tourism, has already been suspected with Plasmodium falci- parum (Volney et al. 2002). Moreover, the vector Aedes (Ste- gomyia) aegypti, though mainly anthropophilic, can be found at the edge of forest habitats (Fouque and Carinci 1996) and could therefore provide a mechanism for virus introduction in forest animal communities. It thus seems to be of major importance to consider wildlife species not only as potential reservoirs for DENV, but also as potential hosts, sensitive to infection by “human” infectious agents. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that wild an- imals could maintain the four DENV serotypes in South America. Further investigations will have to be conducted to confirm their potential role as reservoirs and/or as sec- ondary hosts (Haydon et al. 2002). Actually, all these mam- malian species can be either an epidemic dead end or can play a role in maintaining the virus during interepidemic pe- riods or even in virus amplification. Experimental infections will therefore be necessary to assess the efficiency of wild mammals as reservoirs. The ecological dynamics of the mam- malian species in relation to that of the virus will also need to be explored. Lastly, extensive research on vectors will be required. Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti is the vector of DENV in French Guiana, since Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus is not recorded in the department. Alhough it is associated with human settlements, it has also been found in the rainforest (Fouque et al. 2004) and could therefore be involved in DENV transmission between humans and mammals and be- tween mammals. Our preliminary mosquito surveys at CT revealed relatively low population densities of Aedes spp., which raises the question of whether other mosquito species identified in the area (e.g., Coquilletidia, Culex, etc.) might be involved in the circulation of the virus among mammals. Ex- perimental infections have suggested that the role of Culex mosquitoes may be negligible in DENV transmission (Vazeille-Falcoz et al. 1999), but extensive vectorial capacity studies on locally captured mosquitoes will be required. Once the questions raised above will have been explored, the results obtained could profoundly modify our vision of the epidemiology of dengue virus in South America.

In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. BecauseWest Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argen- tina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV andWNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 out- break, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However, the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread abundance. For the same reasons, Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed to confirm these relationships.

In 2005, an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths [1]. SLEV has been considered a serious public health threat since 1933, when it was first discovered during a large human encephalitis outbreak that initiated in Missouri, USA [3]. In North America, SLEV is maintained through transmission between Culexmosquito vec- tors and certain passeriform and columbiform birds. In North America, House Sparrow (Pas- seridae; Passer domesticus) and House Finch (Fringillidae; Haemorhousmexicanus) are thought to be principal amplifiers of SLEV in urban locations, with Mourning Dove (Columbidae; Zenaidamacroura) also contributing in rural regions [3]. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. The virus has been isolated from humans (Buenos Aires Province), Culex spp. mosquitoes (Córdoba and Santa Fe provinces) and wild rodents (Córdoba) [4,5]. SLEV has never been isolated from birds in Argentina. How- ever, serological evidence indicates frequent infection of SLEV in Argentine birds [6]. In tem- perate and subtropical regions of Argentina, neutralizing antibodies were detected in a wide range of birds belonging to several families (Furnariidae, Columbidae, Tyrannidae, Fringillidae, Icteridae, Ardeidae and Cotingidae) [6]. In 2005, the first human encephalitis outbreak attributed to SLEV outside the USA took place in Córdoba Province in central Argentina [1], providing an opportunity to characterize the role of avian hosts in the ecology of SLEV in this locale. Because certain birds are the pri- mary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. Thus, we should detect a significant increase in viral activity in birds during an epidemic period compared to an enzootic period. To test this hypothesis, we compared avian SLEV sero- prevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epi- demic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (Flaviviridae; WNV) was also detected in Argentina in 2005 [7, 8], and is closely related to SLEV, all analyses were also con- ducted for WNV. Material and Methods Study area and collection sites Bird captures were carried out during summer and fall of 2004 and 2005 in 4 sites located in Córdoba city (31°24'30”S, 64°11'02”W) (Córdoba Province, Argentina) (Fig 1). This city of 1.3 million inhabitants is situated at 450 m above sea level, and encompasses an area of 576 km2 of which 37.2% is urbanized. The area belongs to the phytogeographic region called Espinal, Cha- queño Domain, or “Chaco Thorn-Forest” [9]. This region is characterized by semi-arid thorn scrub habitat but has been modified intensively by human activities (soy and fruit agriculture, cattle ranching, industrial activity). Isolated patches of natural habitat surrounding the city are comprised of shrub forest. The climate is temperate and semi-arid due to high evapotranspira- tion in spite of a relatively high precipitation level (750–800 mm) [10]. Four sampling sites were selected based upon accessibility, owners’ authorization and feasibility for mist net use; most of them are located in the periphery of the city of Córdoba (Fig 1): 1. Bajo Grande (BG) sewage treatment plant (31°23038@ S; 64°04036@W). The site is sur- rounded by aquatic vegetation, reservoirs, low income human settlements and crop lands (vegetables and fruits). Vegetation is dominated by non-native chinaberry (Melia azedar- ach) and white mulberry (Morus alba) deciduous trees alternating with grasslands.

Permission for sampling work in Bajo Grande and Botanical Garden were obtained from the Municipality of Córdoba. Private landowner permission was obtained for study sites at Camino San Carlos and Villa Gran Parque. Bird captures and sample collection Birds were captured with mist nets (AFOMist Nets, Manomet, Inc., Manomet, MA, USA). Four mist nets per site were installed and operated at dawn and late afternoon. The bird cap- ture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency. Captured birds were identified, weighed, sexed and aged when possible. Wild birds were marked with uniquely numbered aluminum leg bands. Before released, blood-sampled birds were rehydrated with sugar water. Whole blood was collected by jugular (most species) or brachial venipuncture (columbids). Birds that weighed less than 10 grams were not blood-sampled. Blood was placed into a centrifuge tube containing 0.45 mL or 0.9 mL (according to blood sample volume: 0.1 ml or 0.2 ml, respectively) of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) for an approximate 1:10 serum dilution, held at ambient temperature for 20–30 min for coagulation and placed into coolers. At the laboratory, samples were centrifuged at 5,000g for 15 min for separation of serum. Sera were stored at -20°C. Prior to analysis, sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C to inactivate non-specific inhibitors of virus neutralization. Ethics Statement The bird capture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency (586869- 053-107). Birds were handled following guidelines for the use of wild birds in research elabo- rated by the Ornithological Council (http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/ guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf). Field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. All blood sampling proce- dures were specifically approved as part of the obtaining field permit. Viral stocks preparation Low-passage SLEV CbaAr-4005 and WNV NY99-4132 strains were used for serologic assays. CbaAr-4005strain of SLEV was isolated from Culex quinquefasciatusmosquitoes collected in Córdoba during the human encephalitis outbreak of 2005 [5]. NY99-4132 strain of WNV was obtained from the brain of an American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) collected in New York during 1999. Viral stocks were obtained from infected Vero cell monolayers harvested on day 7 and 5 post-inoculation for SLEV and WNV, respectively. Serological assays and data interpretation Avian serum samples were screened for the presence of WNV- and SLEV-reactive antibodies by the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A suspension of approximately 100 pla- que-forming units (PFU) of virus in 75 μL of MEM was added to an equal volume of diluted avian serum, bringing the final serum dilution to 1:20. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Vero cell monolayers grown in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) were inoculated with 0.1 mL of the serum-virus mixture and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were overlaid with an initial 1 mL of 0.5% agarose in M-199 medium supplemented with 350 mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 29.2 mg/L L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin, SLEV andWNV Activity Patterns in Urban Birds, Argentina PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0161871 August 26, 2016 4 / 14 http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf streptomycin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B). After 3 and 6 days of incubation with WNV and SLEV, respectively, cultures were overlaid again with the same nutrient–agarose mix but also containing 0.004% neutral red for staining and visualization of viral plaques. Plaques were counted the following day. Serum samples that neutralized> 80% of the challenge virus (rela- tive to a serum-free control) were selected for further titration against both WNV and SLEV. Flavivirus titers of serum samples that tested positive in screen tests were determined as fol- lows. Seven serial two-fold dilutions of serum in MEM were prepared beginning with a dilution of 1:10. Virus mixtures were added as described above, resulting in final serum dilutions of 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1280. Endpoint titers were assigned as the reciprocal of the greatest dilution in which>80% neutralization of the challenge virus was achieved. Experiments that evaluated cross reaction among SLEV and WNV in heterologous inoculation scenarios in Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) indicated no cross reaction among SLEV and WNV (Contigiani MS personal communication).Based on this evidence, plus studies by Patiris et al. [11] and Ledermann et al. [12], we considered all serum samples with antibody titers higher than 20 positive. Therefore samples with titers higher than 20 for both viruses were con- sidered as multiple heterologous infections. Statistical analysis Infection prevalence with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for both viruses. Infection proportions within the year and month of sampling were compared using the Fisher exact test or Pearson chi-square test. P-values were considered significant at a threshold of α = 0.05. The homology between spatial activity for SLEV and the bird community was explored by means of a Procrustes analysis [13]. First, we selected a subset of 6 species that accounted for the majority of captures (51%) and 70% of SLEV seroprevalence, which included Eared Dove (Zenaida auri- culata), Picui Ground-Dove (Columbina picui), Rufous Hornero (Furnarius rufus), House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Great Kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus) and Bay-winged Cowbird (Agelaioides badius). These 6 species were represented in all sampled sites. Abundance and absolute prevalence matrix were built and data exploration showed the need to remove VP from the dataset (due to double zeros abundance). These frequency matrices were used to pro- duce unconstrained ordinations analysis with chi-square distance (community assemblage matrix) and Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (SLEV seroprevalence matrix). Finally, the ordination configuration homology was estimated by a Procrustes analysis and its statistical significance was calculated after 9999 permutations [13]. All analyses were run using vegan and core packages within the R platform [14,15,16]. In order to explore the effect of new species detected as infected on the overall avian sero- prevalence among the study periods, we compared the proportion of infected birds of the selected species (same subset as used for the spatial analysis) vs. the proportion of infected birds of the non-selected species, for a given period. Results A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV- and WNV-neutralizing antibodies. Analyzed sera belonged to 65 species and 27 families of free-ranging birds. SLEV seropreva- lence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005 (Table 1). Although the difference in sero- prevalence observed between years was significant (Fisher exact test, p<0.001), no significant difference was detected between months within each year (2004, χ2 = 1.51, df = 3, p = 0.68; 2005, χ2 = 0.44, df = 2, p = 0.80). During January-April 2004 only 3 birds tested positive for SLEV-neutralizing antibodies (0.7%). SLEV activity was found in 3 resident (i.e. non-migra- tory) bird species: Rufous Hornero (2.0%, 1/49), Bay-winged Cowbird (8.3%, 1/12) and Great SLEV andWNV Activity Patterns in Urban Birds, Argentina PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0161871 August 26, 2016 5 / 14 Kiskadee (1.2%, 1/80). These three seropositive individuals were distributed among three of the four study sites (Fig 1). One of these (Rufous Hornero) seroconverted from January to March (Table 2). Of 14 other recaptured birds in 2004, none seroconverted. In the second period (Jan- uary-March 2005), an overall SLEV seroprevalence of 7.7% (42/543) was registered, with sero- positive birds detected at all four study sites. Multiple infections for SLEV and WNV were detected in 6 serum samples (1.1%).Neutralizing antibody titer ranged from 40 to 1280, with titers of 40 and 160 the most frequently detected. SLEV seroprevalence increased between years in all three paired-year sites, showing significance differences between 2004 and 2005 (BG: χ2 = 136; p<0.001; CS: χ2 = 58; p = 0.01 and VP: χ2 = 56.35; p = 0.01) (Fig 1). Differences were also observed among sites within 2005 (χ2 = 24.53; df = 3; p = 0.006). In 2005, the number of SLEV-seropositive bird species increased from 3 in the previous year to 15 (Table 3). The avian families with the highest seroprevalence for SLEV-neutralizing anti- bodies were: Columbidae (14.0%; 14/101); Tyrannidae (10.1%; 14/138); Furnariidae (6.3%; 4/ 63); Thraupidae (5.5%; 2/36); Turdidae (4.5%; 1/22); Passeridae (3.9%; 2/51); and Icteridae (1.7%; 1/59). The seroprevalence by bird species ranged between 0% and 28.6%. Highest values were observed in Brown Cacholote (Pseudoseisura lophotes, 28.6%; 2/7) and Picui Ground- Dove (15.4%; 10/65). Two out of 25 recaptured birds seroconverted for SLEV during the Janu- ary-March 2005 period (Table 2). Bird community assemblage ordination showed pairwise overlapping (BG-CS, BG-BT) total inertia 0.62. Two first axes explained 78% of the variation (Fig 2A). Great Kiskadee is a common element in the BG-CS paired cluster. Picui Ground-Dove, Eared Dove and Bay- winged Cowbird/House Sparrow abundances are key species in the ordination of CS, BG and BT respectively. Rufous Hornero was common among all sites analyzed. Two convergent solu- tions were found after six iterations running NMDS analyses (stress: 0.1267; non-metric fit R2 = 0.9840; RMSE = 2.77−5). SLEV prevalence ordination shows a complete overlapping among analyzed sites suggesting a similar composition of infected bird species (Fig 2B). In site BG, infected individuals of all six selected species were detected. Infected Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) was only detected here. Sites BT and CS share the absence of infection in Shiny Cowbird, Eared Dove and Rufous Hornero (Fig 2A). Procrustes test was not signifi- cant (m2 = 0.7775; t0 = 0.4717; p-value = 0.3456) and failed to detect an association pattern between SLEV prevalence and bird abundance by sites. During 2005, whereas the SLEV seroprevalence among birds appeared to be relatively stable, with no significant change among sampling months, the number of infected bird species increased throughout the sampling period. Moreover, the relative importance of the 6 selected species used in the spatial analysis diminished from January to March as more species were Table 1.

The monthly infected bird species richness increased by 67% from January to March (Fig 3B). Only Picui Ground-Dove, Great Kiskadee and Eared Dove were detected as seropositive in all three months surveyed in 2005. Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee together contributed the largest number of infected individ- uals by month (approximately 50% of all seropositive birds each month). No WNV-neutralizing antibody was detected during January–April, 2004, among 437 bird sera analyzed. However, during January–March, 2005, the WNV seroprevalence observed was 1.5% (8/543, binomial 95% CI: 0.6–2.9%). Highest WNVseroprevalence was observed in March (2.3%; 95%CI = 1.7% - 9.0%;5/125) compared to January (0.9%;95% CI = 0.2% - 4.8%; 1/114) and February (0.5%; 1/209; 95%CI = 0.1% - 2.7%).WNV seropositive birds were observed in BG (1.3%; 2/160; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.4%), BT (1.1%; 2/176; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.1%) and CS (2.0%; 3/151; 95%CI = 0.7% - 5.7%). Only four out of 52 bird species were positive for WNV-neutralizing antibodies: American Kestrel (Falco sparverius); Rufous Hornero; House Sparrow; and Great Kiskadee (Table 2). Four WNV seroconversion events were registered out of 25 opportunities in 2005, most of them in Rufous Hornero (Table 3). Discussion Arbovirus activity is influenced in a complex manner by several biological and environmental factors [17]. As in North America, it appears thatcertain birds play an important role in the amplification of SLEV during outbreaks of human disease. Our study indicated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host popula- tion was primed to amplify SLEV. Another biologic factor that may have promoted the SLEV outbreak could be the sustained increase in abundance of the main vector Culex quinquefascia- tus which has been documented elsewhere [18,19]. In temperate areas, arbovirus transmission is highly influenced by mosquito vector abundance [20,21]. In urban sites of central Argentina, SLEV is mainly transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus [22] and potentially also by Culex inter- for [5]. These mosquitoes’ populations have two annual peaks: a small one in late spring-early summer (November-December) and a large one in late summer-early fall (February-March) [18,19]. Based on this vector pattern one would expect the presence of two peaks of SLEV activ- ity, which indeed was observed during this human encephalitis outbreak [1]. The high avian SLEV seroprevalence detected in January, followed by no discernable increase in antibody Table 3.

Some transmission continued in birds after January as evidenced by two serocon- version events (Table 3) and an expanding number of seropositive bird species (Fig 3B). The apparent reduction in avian seroprevalence for SLEV inMarch 2005 can be explained in several ways: 1. By March, conditions for SLEV amplification among birds were no longer favor- able, and the detectable seroprevalence dropped as a consequence of normal bird movements (emi- gration of seropositive individuals and immigration of seronegative individuals from regions where SLEV was not active); 2. Diminishing detectability of SLEV antibodies as birds aged and their anti- bodies, derived from infections several months earlier, began to wane to undetectable levels. SLEV antibodies in some birds infected during December to January could become undetectable in March due to diminishing neutralizing antibody titers below the detection threshold (20) [23,24]. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments (urbanized neighborhoods as well as patches of native habitat) throughout the city of Córdoba, indicating that ecological requirements for its maintenance are present. However, variation in the force of viral transmission among sites was observed. The highest activity was registered in the eastern peri-urban site (BG). This area contains large polluted water reservoirs and trash dumps, which support an abundant population of Culex quinquefasciatus. These landscape elements agree with those associated with risk of human infection identified by Vergara Cid et al. [25]. Differences in transmission among sites would be due to fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts. Infected bird species found during the SLEV epidemic period belong to the same families (Columbidae, Furnariidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidae) as those detected during enzootic periods further north in Argentina [6]. Presumably, a strain of SLEV would utilize similar vector and vertebrate host species for its maintenance/amplification throughout its geographic range. Hence, spatiotemporal variation in transmission would result from differing ecological features such as vector and vertebrate host abundance and distribution, habitat use and population dynamics. Within the epidemic period, we observed an increase in the number of SLEV- infected bird species between months (Fig 3). Whether this was due to a change in transmission ecology (i.e. a shift of transmission to novel amplifier hosts) or spillover to tangential avian hosts remains unknown. However, infected individuals of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kis- kadee were reliably present at all sampling sites. Multivariate analysis used in the geospatial analyses compared the bird species composition and SLEV seroprevalence among the study sites, but failed to detect a clear separation pattern. In our study, avian community assemblage varied among sites (Fig 2A) yet SLEV seropreva- lence ordination overlapped with all sites. The overlapping pattern observed in SLEV seroprev- alence could be explained by the presence of identical/similar mosquito vector(s) with similar host preferences. Such was the case for WNV in the eastern USA where viral activity is driven by mosquito host preference [26]. Although WNV and SLEV share ecological requirements, this hypothesis must be corroborated for SLEV. Eared Dove and Picui Ground-Dove (Columbidae), Great Kiskadee (Tyrannidae) and Brown Cacholote (Furnariidae) had high seroprevalence (>12%), are widely dispersed and are abundant in several ecosystems (urban and rural habitats). Moreover, seropositive individuals of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee were frequently detected during the epidemic Fig 2.

These features make these species candidates for amplifying hosts of SLEV. Experimental infections of adult Eared Dove demonstrated this species’ competence to infect a local strain of Culex quinquefasciatus with the enzootic 78V-6507 strain of SLEV [27]. Another interesting species is Rufous Hornero. Although its infection prevalence was low (3.7%), it is abundant in urban and rural areas. Since it is highly territorial and easy to collect with mist nets, and it is frequently infected with both SLEV andWNV, it could represent an important amplifier as well as a good sentinel for flavivirus transmission activity. The House Sparrow is the main SLEV host in largely urban areas of the USA[3]. However, previous reports from Argentina highlighted the absence of SLEV-infected House Sparrow (more than 200 sera ana- lyzed) and questioned its role as amplifying host for SLEV in Argentina [6]. For the first time in South America, our study detected SLEV-infected individuals of House Sparrow (seroprevalence<5%). Host competence assays carried out with North American House Spar- row and SLEV strains isolated in South America suggested a poor amplification potential for House Sparrow [28,29]. However, without data on host competence derived from infection studies matching Argentinean strains of SLEV with a sympatric population of House Sparrow, we cannot speculate regarding its role as an amplifier of SLEV in Argentina. The first evidence of autochthonous circulation for West Nile virus (WNV) in the American continent was detected in 1999 in New York City [30]. Thereafter, it rapidly spread throughout the NewWorld [31,32]. In Argentina this virus caused epizootic events in equines [7]. Molecu- lar characterization indicated that the introduced strain in Argentina belongs to the I2 lineage (NY99 strain cluster) [33]. A serosurvey of free-ranging birds indicated widespread transmis- sion, with no evidence for disease detected in Argentinean birds [8]. The earliest detection of WNV-neutralizing antibodies in birds from Argentina was January 2005, indicating that WNV circulation in this country had begun by the end of 2004. In the present study, we document four birds that seroconverted to WNV sometime between January and March 2005. One of them was negative in January and had seroconverted to positive 34 days later in February. Host competence assays carried out in urban birds have indicated that the Picui Ground-Dove is competent to amplify WNV [34]. However none of 65 representatives of this species was found to have been infected by WNV in Córdoba. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in a variety of avian species. Seroprevalence combined with avian abundance may be used to iden- tify candidate amplifier hosts. Competence studies are needed to verify the importance of these candidates as amplifiers, as well as vector feeding studies to confirm vector-amplifier host con- tact. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV. Rufous Hornero and Brown Cacholote are also frequently infected and may be useful sentinels because of their local residence, territoriality and ease of capture. Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina.

Fajs-2012-Phylogeographic characterization of.pdf	pone.0048420 1..8 Phylogeographic Characterization of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus from Patients, Rodents and Ticks in Slovenia Luka Fajs1, Emina Durmiši1, Nataša Knap1, Franc Strle2, Tatjana Avšič-Županc1* 1 Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2 Department of Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Abstract Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important arboviral agent causing infections of the central nervous system in central Europe. Previous studies have shown that TBEV exhibits pronounced genetic variability, which is often correlated to the geographical origin of TBEV. Genetic variability of TBEV has previously been studied predominantly in rodents and ticks, while information about the variability in patients is scarce. In order to understand the molecular relationships of TBEV between natural hosts, vectors and humans, as well as correlation between phylogenetic and geographical clustering, sequences of TBEV E and NS5 protein genes, were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from TBE-confirmed patients as well as from rodents and ticks collected from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia. A total of 27 partial E protein gene sequences representing 15 human, 4 rodent and 8 tick samples and 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences representing 17 human, 5 rodent and 8 tick samples were obtained. The complete genome sequence of TBEV strain Ljubljana I was simultaneously obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the E and NS5 protein gene sequences revealed a high degree of TBEV variability in patients, ticks and rodents. Furthermore, an evident correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering was shown that was independent of the TBEV host. Moreover, we show the presence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient sample, which was supported with multiple recombination event detection methods. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed the genetic relationships of directly sequenced TBEV samples from patients, ticks and rodents and provides the largest set of patient-derived TBEV sequences up to date. In addition, we have confirmed the geographical clustering of TBEV sequences in Slovenia and have provided evidence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome, obtained from a patient.

TBEV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [1]. TBEV genome comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb, which encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural and seven non-structural proteins [2]. Phylogenetic analyses of TBEV isolates identified three TBEV subtypes: European (TBEV-Eu), Far Eastern (TBEV-Fe) and Siberian (TBEV-Sib) [3]. TBEV is transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks. Primary vector of the TBEV-Eu subtype strains is Ixodes ricinus. TBE is maintained in the ecosystem between tick and vertebrate hosts. The most important vertebrate reservoirs in Europe are rodents. Rodents serve as both maintaining and amplifying hosts [1]. Although TBEV viral load is often low or undetectable, they play an important role in the circulation of the virus in nature as they enable co-feeding of infected and uninfected ticks [4]. In TBE-endemic areas the virus is distributed patchily in geographically limited areas, known as TBE-foci [1,5]. Within such foci, several genetic variants of TBEV have been identified [6–12]. Furthermore, several studies have identified geographical clustering of specific TBEV variants within small geographic areas [6–8]. Gaumann et al. for example performed phylogenetic analysis of 71 TBEV found in I. ricinus in Switzerland and identified 10 phylogenetic clades of closely related TBEV, some of which showed regional clustering [6]. Furthermore, Weidmann et al. have also identified the presence of several viral variants in ticks in Czech Republic and Germany. Their analysis also showed regional clustering of TBEV variants and a correlation between the genetic and geographic distances of TBEV isolates. They were thereby able to determine the direction of spread of TBEV in Central Europe in a westerly direction [7]. These studies were focused on determination of genetic variability of TBEV in rodents and ticks, but little is known about genetic variability of TBEV in patients in endemic areas. While the incidence of disease has been shown to be correlated with the regional prevalence of TBEV in ticks and rodents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48420 [8,13,14] limited information is available on the relatedness of TBEV strains among different hosts in endemic areas. Durmiši et al. [8] have shown for example that TBEV is genetically related in ticks and patients in Slovenia. The aim of our study was to expand the knowledge about the genetic relatedness of TBEV in rodents, ticks and patients in Slovenia. Furthermore, we aim to determine the overall genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia and assess if there is a correlation between phylogenetic and geographic clustering of TBEV variants in Slovenia in all three hosts. While previous studies were focused on molecular determination of virus isolates, direct sequencing of RT-PCR products was employed in our study in order to avoid the occurrence of genetic variation due to virus culturing or cloning. Thereby we were able to obtain a more realistic view of the genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia. We report the largest number of patient-derived TBEV sequences to date, and show that geographical clustering of TBEV variants is correlated to the phylogenetic clustering and is independent of the host. We also provide evidence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient. Results Complete genome sequence of TBEV strain Ljubljana I was determined and deposited in the GenBank database under accession number JQ654701. Genome organization analysis of the 11,092 bp long sequence revealed that it was identical to that of other members of the TBEV group. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain TBEV Ljubljana I belongs to the TBE-Eu subtype (Figure 1) and is most closely related to the Central European TBEV strains Salem and 263 both on the nucleotide level and the deduced amino acid level (divergence 2.0% and 0.6%). When TBEV strain Ljubljana I complete genome sequence was compared with 51 complete genomes of TBEV deposited in GenBank, a total of 7 unique amino acid substitutions were detected. A total of 27 partial E protein gene sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from clinical samples of TBE-confirmed patients, ticks and rodents: 15 from human samples, 8 from tick samples and 4 from rodent samples. A 757 bp long segment of the E protein gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 95.6 to 100% (divergence 0–4.4%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level ranged from 98.4–100% (divergence 0–1.6%). The most promi- nent amino acid change compared to the TBE-Eu reference strain Neudörfl was I167V, which was present in all Slovenian sequences. In addition, a larger part of the E protein gene (1164 bp) sequence was obtained from 20 samples. A total of 15 amino acid changes were detected compared to the reference Neudörfl strain. The most prominent amino acid changes compared to the Neudörfl strain were the same as observed in the 757 bp long segment. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1164 bp segment revealed that the 757 bp long segment was equally informative and therefore the 757 bp segment was used for further analyses. A total of 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences were obtained: 17 from human samples, 8 from tick samples and 5 from rodent samples. A 933 bp long segment of the NS5 protein gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. The identity of the determined TBEV NS5 gene nucleotide sequences ranged from 96.7 to 100% (divergence 0–3.3%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level ranged from 97.4–100% (divergence 0–2.6%). A total of 8 amino acid changes were detected compared to the Neudörfl strain. The most prominent amino acid changes were V51M and K108R which were present in all Slovenian sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the 757 bp TBEV E gene sequences revealed that sequences grouped in three major clades (A1–A3) and four additional minor clades (A4–A7), with high posterior probabilities (Figure 2). Phylogenetic clustering was independent of the TBEV host. Namely, TBEV sequences from ticks, rodents and patients clustered together. Similar results were obtained from the phylogenetic analysis of the 933 bp long TBEV NS5 protein gene sequences (Figure 3). Three major and four minor clades were formed (A1–A7). Sequences that clustered together in the E protein gene phylogenetic analysis also clustered together in the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. The only major exception was clustering of a TBEV sequence obtained from a patient sample H-49. While it clustered within clade A1 based on the E protein gene phylogenetic analysis, it clustered within clade A4 based on the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. Because the resulting branch swap could had occurred due to a recombination event, we addressed this question by analyzing concatenated E and NS5 protein gene sequences from samples where both were available (n = 22). Analysis revealed a putative recombination event in the E protein gene region of sample H-49 including two parental sequences H-51 (cluster A5) and H-61 (cluster A1). The recombination event was most strongly supported by the 3Seq algorithm (average p-value 9.10861024) and less with algorithms MaxChi (4.62361022), Chimaera (3.40461022) and SiScan (1.12961022). To assess potential correlation of sequence divergence to geographical locations, sample isolation locations were plotted on the map of Slovenia and colored according to their respective phylogenetic clustering based on E and NS5 protein gene sequence analysis (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4, a high level of regional clustering was present both after E and NS5 protein gene sequence analysis. Sequences from clades A1 and A3 were obtained from samples in the northern and central part of Slovenia while the sequences from clades A2 and A4 were obtained mostly from the southern part of Slovenia. Some level of regional clustering was observed also within clades A1, A3 and A2, A4: sequences from clade A1 being present even more to the north of Slovenia than the majority of sequences in clade A3 and sequences from clade A2 being present in the south-western part of Slovenia and sequences from clade A4 being present in the south-eastern part of Slovenia. As expected, the largest discordance was observed for the putatively recombinant sequence from sample H-49. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between genetic and geographic distances despite the evident correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering. Therefore, direction of spread of TBEV in Slovenia could not be determined. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the years of sampling and phylogenetic clustering. Discussion The aim of our study was to determine the genetic diversity of TBEV virus variants present in TBE endemic regions in Slovenia from human, tick and rodent samples. Nucleotide sequences were obtained by directly sequencing RT-PCR products from these samples in an attempt to avoid the occurrence of mutations that could arise in the process of virus culturing or cloning. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that employed direct determination of nucleotide sequences and simultaneous analysis of TBEV sequences from three TBEV hosts in one geographical area. We have shown that sequences from all three analyzed TBEV hosts cluster together. This observation is in concordance with the low mutation rate of TBEV and its conservative nature due to selective pressures implicated by the course of host Genetic Characterization of TBEV in Slovenia PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48420 switching. These results also imply that a limited number of genetic changes occur in the course of human infection. With respect to the quick course of disease and the low mutation rate of TBEV, these results are expected. Relatively high genetic variability of Slovenian TBEV was observed. Seven phylogenetic clades were determined both on the E and NS5 protein gene sequence analyses. Previous studies of genetic diversity of TBEV have also shown that multiple sequence variants are present in relatively small geographical areas. Genetic variability of the Slovenian TBEV variants is similar to those reported in previous studies (nucleotide sequence identity 96.1 to 100%) [6,7,10,15,16]. Our results also revealed that TBEV variants in Slovenia show correlation between geographical and phylogenetic clustering which is in concordance with previous reports [8]. Clustering was most evident for sequences in clades A1 and A3, which were obtained in the northern part of Slovenia and sequences in clades A2 and A4 which were present predominantly in the southern part of Slovenia. The observed distribution could be attributed to natural (levels of forestation) and human (freeways and larger cities) factors that prevent migration of hosts from the northern to the southern part of Slovenia and vice versa. In a recent study, Weidmann et al. [7] analyzed TBEV sequences from ticks in the Czech Republic and Germany, and have shown that TBEV was spread in the Central Europe from the east to west. Since in our study no correlation was observed between genetic and geographical distances we could not assess the direction of spread of TBEV in Slovenia. Namely, sequences from geograph- ically related clades did not exhibit higher genetic identities. This was most profoundly seen in the analysis of clades A1 and A3, which show greatest genetic divergence but originate from geographically close locations. These results could indicate that TBEV was introduced in Slovenia on multiple occasions. In order to confirm these findings a larger number of TBEV sequences from the eastern and western part of Slovenia should be included. Correlation between phylogenetic and geographical clustering was evident also on a smaller scale. Namely, ticks and rodents from the same or nearby isolation sites shared a high level of sequence identity, whereas ticks and rodent from different locations showed greater sequence divergence. A similar but not as evident trend was also seen in human samples. Of note, the phylogeographic analysis of the human samples included the locations of residency which do not necessarily correlate to the site of infection. In Slovenia nationwide travel is frequent due to the short distances and therefore it is not unlikely that patients with residence in one part of Slovenia got infected in other parts of Slovenia. On the other hand, despite the frequent migrations a geographically and phylogenetically well separated cluster of four patients in the south-eastern part of Slovenia was observed (clade A4), implying that this variant most likely also circulates in rodents and ticks in that area. Of note are also minor clades A5–A7 that were supported by the analysis of both E and NS5 protein gene sequences, which Figure 1.

In order to confirm this observation, further sampling of ticks and rodents in that area would be necessary. Analysis also revealed, that the phylogenetic clustering was not correlated to the year of sampling, therefore a temporal effect of the observed phylogenetic clustering was excluded. An interesting finding was the observed differential clustering of TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences obtained from a patient sample H-49. E protein gene phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering in clade A1, while the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis showed clustering in clade A4. Because, such phylogenetic jumps often arise due to recombination events, we tested this hypothesis with several recombination event detection methods. Analyses confirmed the possible recombination event between a virus from clade A4 and a virus from clade A1. Because rigorous contamination control measures were undertaken during this study, we believe that these results are most reliable. Reports on recombination in tick-borne viruses are scarce. To best our knowledge the only reported possible recombination event were detected by Uzcategui et al. [17] and Yun et al. [18]. Although no major recombination events were detected in these studies, several minor recombination events were discovered. In this view, our study gives the first evidence of possible recombination within different TBEV variants from patients. Because these results are Figure 3.

In conclusion, our study provides the largest set of patient- derived TBEV sequences and for the first time compares TBEV sequences from rodents, ticks and patients from one endemic area. All sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. Our results show that similar TBEV variants are present in all three hosts. Furthermore, our analysis revealed relatively high genetic variability of TBEV and evidence of geographical clustering of TBEV in Slovenia. In addition, we provide evidence of a possible recombination event in TBEV genome obtained from a patient. Materials and Methods Samples TBEV strain Ljubljana I isolated in 1992 from blood of a TBE patient was used for the completion of the whole genome sequence [19]. Low-level passage was used for the determination of the complete genome. Previously confirmed TBEV RNA-positive samples were selected from a collection of TBE-confirmed patient, tick and rodent samples stored at the Laboratory for Diagnosis of Zoonoses at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I. ricinus ticks were collected by flagging in TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia from 2005–2007 and were processed as described in [8]. Rodents were collected using live traps in years 2007–2008, from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia, and were processed as described in [13]. Human serum samples were collected from year 2000–2010 as a part of routine diagnostic testing. Since the study was retrospective, informed consent from the patients was not obtained. Instead, the research was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia. Also, the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, and the Slovene Code of Medical Deontology were followed in the conduct of this research. All human samples were anonymized and no additional sample was taken for the purpose of the study. Samples were stored at 280uC until further processing. Sampling locations of tick and rodent samples as well as locations of residency of patients are shown in Table 1. Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR Total RNA from human serum samples was extracted using TrizolH LS Reagent (Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from homogenized ticks or mice spleen was extracted using TrizolH Reagent (Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was stored at 220uC for up to a week or at 280uC for long term storage. TBEV Real-Time RT-PCR positive samples were included in this study. Real-Time RT-PCR was performed as previously described in [20]. Partial TBE E gene was amplified and sequenced using primer pairs TBE1082 and TBEc2022 [21] or TBE ENV 3F (59TGA GGG GAA GCC TTC AAT39) and TBE ENV 3R (59TCA TGT TCA GGC CCA ACC A39). Partial TBE NS5 gene was amplified and sequenced using primer pairs TBE7547 and TBEc8732 [21]. RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScriptH III One-Step RT-PCR System with PlatinumH Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Sequencing of PCR products Amplified PCR products were purified with the WizardH SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Cycle sequencing was performed using the BigDyeH Terminator 3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with the BigDyeH XTerminatorTM Purification kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with the 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosys- tems). DNA sequence analysis Nucleotide sequences were assembled and cropped to equal lengths using CLC Main Workbench software (CLC bio, Den- mark) and were aligned in MEGA version 5 [22] using Muscle algorithm. For the complete genome analysis of the TBEV Ljubljana I strain we included in the alignment 52 complete genome sequences of TBEV representing all three TBEV subtype groups available. Complete genome sequence of OMSK hemor- rhagic fever virus was used as an outgroup for the analysis. Accession numbers of all included sequences are presented in Figure 1. Nucleotide substitution model was selected based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) in jModelTest, version 0.1.1 [23]. The general time-reversible model with gamma-distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) was employed for all phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed in MrBayes 3.2 [24] and Tracer version Figure 4.

Three independent MCMC runs of four chains each consisting of 10,000,000 generations were run to ensure effective sample sizes (ESS) of at least 200. Maximum clade credibility trees were depicted using FigTree version 1.3.1 [25]. Recombination detection TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences (757 bp and 933 bp in length respectively) which were obtained from the same samples were concatenated in CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio, Den- mark). Concatenated sequences were aligned using Muscle algorithm in MEGA version 5 [22] and analyzed for putative recombination events using Rdp version 3.44 software (Heath L, et al 2006). An exploratory search was employed using methods RDP [26], GENECOV [27], Chimaera [28], MaxChi [29], BootScan [30], Siscan [31] and 3Seq [32].

Hubalek-2012-Tick-borne viruses in Europe.pdf	REVIEW Tick-borne viruses in Europe Zdenek Hubálek & Ivo Rudolf Received: 23 January 2012 /Accepted: 20 March 2012 /Published online: 18 April 2012 # Springer-Verlag 2012 Abstract The aim of this review is to present briefly back- ground information on 27 tick-borne viruses (“tiboviruses”) that have been detected in Europe, viz flaviviruses tick- borne encephalitis (TBEV), louping-ill (LIV), Tyuleniy (TYUV), and Meaban (MEAV); orthobunyaviruses Bahig (BAHV) and Matruh (MTRV); phleboviruses Grand Arbaud (GAV), Ponteves (PTVV), Uukuniemi (UUKV), Zaliv Terpeniya (ZTV), and St. Abb's Head (SAHV); nairoviruses Soldado (SOLV), Puffin Island (PIV), Avalon (AVAV), Clo Mor (CMV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV); bunyavirus Bhanja (BHAV); coltivirus Eyach (EYAV); orbi- viruses Tribec (TRBV), Okhotskiy (OKHV), Cape Wrath (CWV), Mykines (MYKV), Tindholmur (TDMV), and Bau- line (BAUV); two thogotoviruses (Thogoto THOV, Dhori DHOV); and one asfivirus (African swine fever virus ASFV). Emphasis is laid on the taxonomic status of these viruses, range of their ixodid or argasid vectors and vertebrate hosts, pathogenicity for vertebrates including humans, and relevance to public health. In general, three groups of tibovirus diseases can be recognized according to main clinical symptoms produced: (i) febrile illness—usually with a rapid onset, fever, sweating, headache, nausea, weak- ness, myalgia, arthralgia, sometimes polyarthritis and rash; (ii) the CNS affection—meningitis, meningoencephalitis or en- cephalomyelitis with pareses, paralysis and other sequelae; (iii) hemorrhagic disease. Several “European” tiboviruses cause very serious human (TBEV, CCHFV) or animal (LIV, ASFV) diseases. Other arboviruses play definite role in hu- man or animal pathology though the disease is usually either less serious or infrequently reported (TYUV, BHAV, AVAV, EYAV, TRBV, DHOV, THOV). The other European arbovi- ruses are “orphans” without a proven medical or veterinary significance (BAHV, MTRV, MEAV, GAV, PTVV, ZTV, SAHV, UUKV, SOLV, PIV, AVAV, CMV, OKHV, CWV, MYKV, TDMV, BAUV). However, certain arbovirus diseases of free-living vertebrates (but also those of domestic animals and even man) may often pass unnoticed or misdiagnosed and eventually, they might potentially appear as emerging dis- eases. Active search for new tiboviruses or for new, pathogen- ic variants of the known tiboviruses in Europe should therefore continue.

Hubálek (*) : I. Rudolf Institute of Vertebrate Biology, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Květná 8, 60365 Brno, Czech Republic e-mail: zhubalek@brno.cas.cz Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 DOI 10.1007/s00436-012-2910-1 (Ixodidae and Argasidae, respectively) to endotherm (homeotherm, warm-blooded) vertebrates. Competent vec- tors are those arthropods that are able to imbibe the virus in the course of blood-feeding on an infected donor vertebrate host, to support the multiplication of the virus in their organism and to deliver a sufficiently large inoculum to the recipient, uninfected vertebrate host. Usually certain minimum level of viremia (“infection threshold”) in a donor vertebrate host is necessary for an efficient infection of particular arthropod vectors. Therefore, only those verte- brate species that produce at least moderate viremia have been regarded as competent, “true” or “amplifying” hosts of particular arboviruses (Bárdoš 1979). However, co-feeding ixodid ticks on a viremia-free host can sometimes also contribute to infection of noninfected ticks (Jones et al. 1987; Alekseev and Chunikhin 1990; Labuda et al. 1993). Some tiboviruses are transmitted from larvae to nymphs and imagoes during metamorphosis (transstadial transmission, TST), from infected female to the offspring (transovarial transmission, TOT), and from male to female tick during copulation (venereal or horizontal transmission). These modes are extremely important ecologically: e.g., under conditions of TOT, the tick vector also plays the role of a long-term reservoir of the virus. In addition to two “major” severe, occasionally re-emerging virus diseases transmitted by ixodid ticks in Europe, viz tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hem- orrhagic fever, there is a number of other, neglected tick-borne virus infections of vertebrates. They are usually infrequent, although some of them are probably underdiagnosed, and other of these tiboviruses are nonpathogenic, or of low path- ogenicity, for vertebrates (Tables 1 and 2). This review briefly summarizes present knowledge espe- cially on the taxonomy, ecology, epidemiology and distri- bution of European tiboviruses; for related reviews and additional, more detailed data, see, e.g. Theiler and Downs (1973), Karabatsos (1985), Málková et al. (1986), Lvov et al. (1989), Hubálek and Halouzka (1996), Charrel et al. (2004), Labuda and Nuttall (2004), Gratz (2006), and Dobler (2010). The virus taxonomy and nomenclature has been adopted from King et al. (2012). Family Flaviviridae Flavivirus of tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) There are three recognized TBEV subtypes: (1) Western or European subtype (TBEV-W), also called Central European (CEEV—topotype strains are Hypr and Neudoerfl) or some- times “ricinus” subtype (Clarke 1964; Votyakov et al. 1978; Rubin and Chumakov 1980; Calisher 1988; Calisher et al. 1989; Gritsun et al. 2003; Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008)— varieties of this subtype are Spanish sheep encephalitis (SSE), Turkish sheep encephalitis (TSE) and Greek goat encephalitis (“Vergina”) viruses; these three varieties are antigenically more closely related to TBEV-W (CEEV) than to louping ill virus (Hubálek et al. 1995); (2) (Ural-)Siberian subtype (TBEV-S: the prototype strains are Aina and Vasil- chenko), sometimes called “persulcatus” subtype, causing Russian spring–summer encephalitis (RSSEV:); (3) Far Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE with prototype strain Sofyin, isolated from human brain in Khabarovsk, 1937). However, all three subtypes occur in Europe—the TBEV-S and TBEV-FE subtypes were recently detected in the Baltic republics and eastern Finland (Golovljova et al. 2004; Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). A taxonomic and nomencla- tural confusion around TBEV has repeatedly been em- phasized (Clarke 1964; Calisher 1988; Holzmann et al. 1992). In addition, TBEV is very closely related to louping-ill virus which should be regarded in fact as the fourth (or, historically, the first) subtype of TBEV (see below). History: in Europe, RSSEV subtype of TBEV was first isolated in the Russian Ural Mts. in 1938 (Chumakov and Zeitlenok 1939), and CEEV (strain “256”) from Ixodes ricinus ticks collected near Minsk, Belarus in 1940 (Levkovich and Karpovich 1962; Votyakov et al. 1978). Further isolations of CEEV were reported in Czechland from human patients and I. ricinus ticks in 1948–1949 (Gallia et al. 1949; Krejčí 1949; Rampas and Gallia 1949). Principal arthropod vectors are ticks of the genus Ixodes: for CEEV I. ricinus (TST, TOT: Benda 1958b; Řeháček 1962; the infection rate may attain 0.5 % to 3 % in valent natural foci: Grešíková 1972), and Ixodes gibbosus (a vicar- iant, marginal vector in the Mediterranean). Occasional vectors are other tick species such as Ixodes hexagonus (Křivanec et al. 1988), possibly Ixodes arboricola (success- ful experimental transmission: Lichard and Kožuch 1967), while only sporadically metastriate tick species Haemaphy- salis inermis, Haemaphysalis concinna (Riedl et al. 1971; TOT), Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus, Dermacentor reticulatus (Georgiev et al. 1971; Kožuch and Nosek 1971; Naumov et al. 1980; Nosek and Kožuch 1985), and Hyalomma marginatum (Crimea). Main vector for RSSEV is Ixodes persulcatus (infection prevalence rates can reach frequently >2 %; TST, TOT: Chunikhin 1990), less often Ixodes ovatus, but also Dermacentor silvarum, D. reticulatus, D. marginatus, H. concinna (TOT), Haemaphy- salis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis japonica (Naumov et al. 1980). Competent vertebrate hosts of TBEV are small forest mammals, especially rodents and insectivores (Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Myodes glareolus, Myodes rufocanus, Microtus agrestis, Sciurus vulgaris, Talpa euro- paea, Sorex araneus, Erinaceus concolor); additional hosts 10 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 may be (due to viremia) goat, sheep, rarely cattle (Brummer- Korvenkontio et al. 1973; Kožuch et al. 1966, 1967a, b; Kiffner et al. 2011). The role of some forest passerines and other birds as hosts of TBEV has not yet been fully eluci- dated; the virus was isolated occasionally from Turdus pila- ris, Turdus iliacus, other Turdus spp., Corvus monedula, Corvus corone, Pica pica, Sturnus vulgaris, Lanius collurio, Fringilla montifringilla, Fringilla coelebs, Loxia curviros- tra, Carduelis flammea, Anthus trivialis, Motacilla alba, Motacilla flava, Emberiza spp., Jynx torquilla, Bonasa bonasia, Crex crex, Scolopax rusticola, Clangula hyemalis, Melanitta fusca, Anas querquedula, Fulica atra (Brummer- Korvenkontio et al. 1973; Ernek 1959; Ernek et al. 1977; Grešíková 1972; Grešíková et al. 1975; Hubálek 1994; Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Saikku 1973; Soběslavský et al. 1960; van Tongeren 1962). A potential for TOTwas demonstrated in some avian species (T. iliacus, T. pilaris, Turdus ruficol- lis, Turdus pallidus, Lanius cristatus, Emberiza fucata, Troglodytes troglodytes, Accipiter gentilis) in Asian Russia by isolation of TBEV from their eggs (Kraminskiy et al. 1972). Experimental viremia has been demonstrated in many mammalian, avian, amphibian, and reptilian species (Naumov and Gutova 1979; Naumov et al. 1983, 1984a, b; Gutova et al. 1985; Chunikhin 1990): Micromys minutus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus subterraneus (Radda et al. 1968), Myodes rufocanus, Myodes rutilus, Glis glis (Kožuch et al. 1963), Myotis myotis, Plecotus auritus, Barbastella barbastellus (Nosek et al. 1961), cat, Mustela nivalis, Mus- tela erminea (Radda et al. 1969), Coturnix coturnix, Anas platyrhynchos (van Tongeren 1983), Lacerta viridis, Table 1 Experimental pathogenicity of tiboviruses occurring in Europe (Karabatsos 1985; Hubálek and Halouzka 1996) SM SM M M H H GP GP C CE Other i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. i.c. i.p. s.c. y.s.

TBEV causes fatal disease in suckling and adult labora- tory mouse at any route including i.n. and p.o., suckling rat (i.c.) but not adult rat (i.c., i.p.), newborn guinea pig (i.c.), suckling hamster (i.c., i.p.), rhesus monkey (i.c., but not all strains, and not at i.n., i.p., s.c. or i.v. routes: Ilyenko et al. 1974; Zlotnik et al. 1976; Pogodina et al. 1981, 1986), lamb and kid (i.c., i.n. but not s.c.). The diffuse meningoenceph- alitis is characterized by perivascular infiltration, neuronal degeneration and necrosis, and focal glial proliferation. On the other hand, no mortality is produced by TBEV in adult forest rodents Apodemus and Myodes spp. (i.p., s.c.), adult rabbit (i.c., i.p.). Encephalitis with ataxia, jumping, tremor, and convulsions can affect lambs, kids or, exceptionally, dogs (Tipold et al. 1993; Pfeffer and Dobler 2011). CEEV infection is usually subclinical in adult ruminants and pig; goats, sheep, and cows excrete virus in the milk (Smoro- dintsev et al. 1953; van Tongeren 1955; Benda 1958a; Grešíková 1958a, b). TBEV (especially TBE-S and TBE- FE virus subtypes) occasionally kills birds of some species, e.g., C. flammea (long-term viremia and the virus excretion in droppings up to 11 months was confirmed experimental- ly), Passer domesticus, and F. atra (van Tongeren 1962; Hubálek 1994), amphibians Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo (s.c.). Natural foci of TBE have been classified (Rosický 1959) as “theriodic” (situated in deciduous and mixed forest eco- systems, often game preserves), “boskematic” (pastoral), mixed “theriodic-boskematic” or “mountain” (Rosický and Bárdoš 1966; Nosek et al. 1982). Urban foci of CEE have also been described in Europe (Málková et al. 1983).

Whereas the tick- transmitted cases are sporadic, the milk-borne infections usually affect whole families or population groups in out- breaks. For instance, a large milk-borne TBE epidemic occurred in Rožňava, East Slovakia in 1951, when 660 persons were infected and 274 of them hospitalized (Blaš- kovič 1954). As much as 76 % of human infections have been alimentary in Belarus (Ivanova 1984). The virus may resist in milk at 60°C for more than 10 min and partially even the pasteurization at 62°C for 20 min, and it is not inactivated at pH 2.8 within 24 h/4°C. In addition, many laboratory infections (usually by infectious aerosol) have been reported in unvaccinated personnel. Human disease caused by TBEV is meningoencephalitis, usually with typical biphasic course: the first phase starts with sudden fever and flu-like symptoms (pronounced head- ache, general weakness, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia), some- times conjunctivitis; the second phase appears after an interval of usually 4–7 days of an apparent recovery, with affection of the CNS (meningoencephalitis) accompanied with fever, retrobulbar pain, photophobia, stiff neck, sleep disorders, excessive sweating, drowsiness, tremors, nystag- mus, meningeal signs, ataxia, pareses of cranial nerves and extremities, dizziness, confusion, psychic instability, excit- ability, anxiety, disorientation, memory loss, and sometimes personality changes. In the CNS, the virus produces diffuse degenerative changes of neurons, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (“cuffing”) and damage to Purkinje cells. Case fatality rate in humans ranges from c. 1 % (in TBEV-W), 7– 8 % (in TBEV-S), up to 20–40 % (TBEV-FE); convales- cence is prolonged, and neurological sequellae (residua) sometimes including pareses are quite common. Major se- quelae such as atrophic paralysis of the neck and shoulder are rare in CEE (Ackermann and Rehse-Küpper 1979; Kunz 1981; Holmgren and Forsgren 1990), whereas they are relatively frequent and occasionally combined with a chron- ic and progressive course (e.g., Kozhevnikov's epilepsy, progressive neuritis of the shoulder plexus, dispersed scle- rosis, progressive muscle atrophy) in RSSE (TBEV-S: Zlotnik et al. 1976; Asher 1979; Pogodina et al. 1986; Gritsun et al. 2003). Several thousand cases of TBE are recorded in Europe each year, with considerable inter-annual variation (Korenberg and Kovalevski 1999; Gritsun et al. 2003; Petri et al. 2010). In some European countries, TBE is quite frequent: for instance, on average, 368 cases (140 to 744 in individual years) a year were reported in Czechland between 1970 and 1999, corresponding to the incidence of 4.2 (1.4–7.4) per 100,000 inhabitants, and it peaked at 1,029 patients (10.0 per 100,000) in the year 2006. In the years 2004–2007, only a few countries have had a higher incidence of TBE than Czech Republic (5.0–10.0): Slovenia 10.2–18.6, Estonia 10.4–13.5, Lithuania 6.5–13.5, Latvia 6.2–10.8, while the TBE incidence was as low as 0.6–1.2 in neighboring Austria, due to a much higher vaccination rate in that country (Mantke et al. 2008). Diagnosis: serology (ELISA, HIT, CFT, VNT), detection of IgM in early phase or seroconversion in paired serum samples; rarely used is the isolation of the virus from the blood or CSF in cell cultures (e.g., PS pig embryo kidney cells) or in mice, and detection of the virus RNA by using RT-PCR. Therapy: specific immunoglobulins can be applied to infected persons but they are only effective when inoculated immediately, i.e., within 1–2 days after infection, otherwise they could be even detrimental. Prevention and control include mapping and surveillance of natural foci of TBE, pasteurization of milk (CEE virus may persist in some dairy products at +4°C for more than 60 days: Grešíková-Kohútová 1959), protection from tick exposure (clothing, repellents), vector tick control, and vac- cination. “FSME-Immun” and “Encepur” vaccines (Loew- Baselli et al. 2011; Petri et al. 2010) consist of purified inactivated virus grown in chicken embryo cells produced by methods largely based on a study of Czech virologists (Daneš and Benda 1962). A mass vaccination campaign of Austrian population living in endemic foci led to a signifi- cant decline of TBE from 612 cases recorded in 1982 to 89 cases diagnosed in 1990 (C. Kunz, pers. comm.), and a similar 5-to-10 times decrease of TBE incidence has been reported in other European countries after frequent vaccina- tion of population. European distribution: Fig. 1 Outside Europe, TBEV occurs in the Asian part of Turkey, Asian Russia (Siberia, Far East), Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, north-eastern China, Japan, and Korean peninsula. Flavivirus louping ill (LIV) Synonym: Negishi virus. Prototype strain of LIV is LI-31. Louping-ill virus is very closely related to TBEV, in fact indistinguishable from it by conventional serological and cross-protection tests (Clarke 1962, 1964; Calisher 1988; Calisher et al. 1989; Kopecký et al. 1991; Shiu et al. 1991; Holzmann et al. 1992; Venugopal et al. 1992; Hubálek et al. 1995) and with difficulties by nucleotide sequence homology of the E gene (Gao et al. 1993; Venugopal et al. 1994; Fig. 2 in Gould et al. 2003, Fig. 3 in Weaver 2006; Grard et al. 2007, Fig. 1 in Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). LIV is antigenically and genomically much closer to CEEV than CEEV is related to RSSEV; LIV should thus not be regarded as a separate virus, in that RSSEVand CEEVare considered subtypes of one virus (TBEV). Therefore, Hubálek et al. (1995) and Grard et al. Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 13 (2007) suggested arrangement of LIV as another subtype of TBEV, and not as a separate virus. Louping-ill has long been recognized as a disease of sheep in Scotland. For instance, it was recorded in the 1795 Statis- tical Account or by Walter Scott in 1891 (Davidson et al. 1991). The virus was first isolated from sheep brain in Selkirkshire, Scotland in 1929 (prototype strain Moredun LI-31: Pool et al. 1930) and it is, in fact, the very first arthropod-borne virus isolated in Europe. Principal vector of LIV is the tick I. ricinus (MacLeod and Gordon 1932); LI is also transmissible by the goat and sheep milk (Reid et al. 1984; Reid and Pow 1985), analog- ically as the other TBEV subtypes. Vertebrate hosts are e.g., wood mouse (A. sylvaticus), common shrew (S. araneus), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), sheep, and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus: Reid 1990; Gilbert et al. 2000). LIV infection is fatal to suckling rat (i.c., i.p.), lamb (i.c., not s.c.), sometimes rhesus Fig. 1 European distribution of natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis (CEE and RSSE) and louping ill (asterisks). Explanation: black dots and black areas, TBE virus isolation or the virus disease. The dotted line shows the limits of the Ixodes ricinus plus I. persulcatus area Fig. 2 European distribution of Tyuleniy (circles) and Meaban (squares) flaviviruses. (Slanted area: antibodies to TYUV) 14 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 monkey (i.c., i.n.: Zlotnik et al. 1976). No symptoms are seen in adult M. agrestis (i.c., s.c.), Cervus elaphus (s.c.), and Capreolus capreolus (s.c.), although meningoencepha- litis was demonstrated histologically in the deer (Reid et al. 1982), and LIV was isolated from a roe deer (Reid et al. 1976). LIV occasionally affects also cattle, pig (piglets), goat (kids), horse, dog, hare, and red grouse (with a mortal- ity rate of 70–80 % especially in juvenile birds: Reid et al. 1978, 1980); interestingly, the grouse chicks die when they eat infected ticks. Typical course of LI in sheep is biphasic, with fever and weakness, followed by meningoencephalitis with cerebellar ataxia, generalized tremor, jumping (to “loup” means to leap in vernacular Scottish), vigorous kick- ing, salivation, champing of jaws, progressing to paralysis, coma and death (lethality 40–60 %). The histopathology shows (sheep, pig, rhesus monkey, or mouse) a diffuse meningoencephalitis with perivascular cuffing, neuronal de- generation, and destruction of Purkinje cells, similar to TBE (Reid 1990). Concurrent tick-borne fever (Anaplasma phag- ocytophilum infection) and external stress enhance the dis- ease course (Reid 1990). Natural foci of LI are “boskematic” (pastoral: Rosický 1959)—rough, poorly drained hill pastures, heather moor- lands with bracken and moor-grass; principally a sheep-tick or sheep-tick-grouse cycle (Reid 1990; Smith and Varma 1981). Unfortunately, spring lambing on hilly pastures coin- cides with the period of peak seasonal activity of the vector in endemic foci. The human illness is usually biphasic; the febrile phase, after a short period of improvement, is followed by high fever and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, headache, weakness, stiff neck, conjunctivitis, retrobulbar pain, pho- tophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, dysarthria, excessive sweat- ing, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, drowsiness, confusion, tremors, nystagmus, and ataxia. Additional symptoms are similar to that of TBE. Nineteen naturally acquired human cases and 26 labora- tory infections with LIV have been described in Great Britain between 1934 and 1990 (Davidson et al. 1991), including one fatal encephalitis in a butcher from northern Scotland (Williams and Thorburn 1962). LIV transmission to man is obviously infrequent in the U.K. because the vector ticks only occasionally bite people in endemic areas (similarly as with Lyme borreliosis). It is primarily an oc- cupational disease, affecting shepherds, crofters, veterinary personnel, forestry workers, butchers and laboratory person- nel. However, human cases of LI with a milder symptom- atology might remain underreported. Diagnosis: as for TBE. TBE vaccine is also protective aginst LIV. Control of LI is mainly based on vaccination of sheep; the inacti- vated LI vaccine is commercially available and in gen- eral use. Tick control by dipping the sheep with residual acaricides is also practicized. The methods of environ- mental control of ticks such as pasture rotation, cutting or burning grass and bush vegetation, and drainage are effective but economically less feasible (Smith and Varma 1981). European distribution: Norway is the only country of the continental Europe where a typical LIV strain was isolated (Gao et al. 1993) (Fig. 1). LIV does not occur outside Europe. Fig. 3 European distribution of Uukuniemi (circles), Grand Arbaud (square), and Ponteves (asterisk) viruses. (Slanted area: antibodies to UUKV) Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 15 Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV) Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV) is related to the Australian Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, VNT and nucleotide sequence of the envelope gene (Marin et al. 1995), while less similar to TBEV by CFT and HIT. TYUV is a member of the Seabird tick-borne virus subgroup of tick-borne flaviviruses. The virus was first isolated from Ixodes uriae collected in nesting grounds ofUria aalge on Tyuleniy Island near Sakha- lin, Sea of Okhotsk (Asian Russia) in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1971), and simultaneously off the western U.S. coast (Clifford et al. 1971). In Europe, the agent was revealed in fact even earlier— in 1967 as “Murman” virus under similar conditions on the Kola Peninsula, northern Russia (Bekleshova et al. 1970). Principal vector is I. uriae (TST, TOT). Mosquitoes (Aedes communis, Aedes punctor, Aedes excrucians) may possibly act as secondary (or mechanical) vectors; success- ful experimental TYUV transmissions by Aedes aegypti, Culex pipiens, and Hyalomma asiaticum have been reported (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Lvov et al. 1971, 1973a, b, c, d). Vertebrate hosts are seabirds U. aalge, Eudyptula minor, and the suslikCitellus undulatus. Antibodies are often present in additional seabirds Uria lomvia, Lunda cirrhata, Frater- cula arctica, Fulmarus glacialis, Phalacrocorax urile, Phala- crocorax aristotelis, Larus argentatus, Larus fuscus, Larus marinus, Larus ridibundus, Rissa tridactyla (French coast: Chastel et al. 1985a, b), and in some mammals (Callorhinus ursinus, Alopex lagopus, Lutreola lutreola). Antibodies were detected in 22–33 % of cattle in the N.-European Russian taiga and tundra zones (Lvov et al. 1989). Animal disease is unknown, but experimentally inoculat- ed (i.c. or s.c.) birds show clinical symptoms: encephalitis with pareses and occasional death in R. tridactyla, L. argen- tatus, and U. lomvia (Berezina et al. 1974). The virus is not pathogenic to adult rabbit (i.p.). Febrile illness with adyna- mia and anorexia was observed in rhesus monkeys infected aerogenically. Natural foci of TYUVare seabird colonies on steep rocks. Three TYUV cases of febrile illness with malaise, laryn- gitis, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and skin petechiae were documented in biologists collecting samples in seabird col- onies in the Murmansk region, 1972–78 (Voinov 1978). European distribution: Fig. 2 Outside Europe TYUV occurs in Asian Russia (Far East–Sea of Okhotsk); coastal West USA (Oregon) and Canada. Migratory seabirds play a role in the exchange of TYUV complex flaviviruses be- tween the northern and southern hemispheres (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979). Flavivirus Meaban (MEAV) MEAV is a member of the Seabird tick-borne virus sub- group of tick-borne flaviviruses, Tyuleniy antigenic complex (Calisher et al. 1989). Prototype: Brest/Ar/T707 (Ornithodoros maritimus, France, 1981). Closely related to the Australian Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, HIT and even VNT (Chastel et al. 1985a, b), while more distantly related to TYUV (unrelated by VNT), TBEVand other flaviviruses. First isolated from argasid ticks collected in seagull col- onies on Méaban and Penfred islands, Brittany (France) in 1981–82 (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). Principal vector is the soft tick O. maritimus (TST). Vertebrate hosts are unknown, but antibodies have been detected in gulls L. argentatus and L. fuscus. Meningoen- cephalitis in suckling mouse caused by MEAV is character- ized by perivascular cuffing and diffuse neuronal necrosis (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). Natural foci of MEAVoccur in seabird colonies. Animal and human disease caused by MEAV has not been reported, and no antibodies toMEAVwere detected by HIT in 562 human sera collected in Brittany (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). European distribution: Fig. 2 Long-distance migratory Sterna paradisaea and Sterna hirundo terns could have contributed to the dispersal of MEAV and Saumarez Reef viruses or their common progenitor between Australia and France (Chastel et al. 1985a, b). Family Bunyaviridae Orthobunyavirus Bahig (BAHV) Tete antigenic group. Prototype: EgB-90 (Oriolus oriolus blood, Egypt, 1966). European topotype: ISS.U.45 (F. mon- tifringilla blood, Italy, 1968). Related to Matruh virus by CFT and HIT (indistinguishable by CFT), less to Tete virus. Originally isolated from the blood of O. oriolus caught at Bahig village near Alexandria, Egypt, in 1966 (Watson et al. 1972). In Europe, first reported from migrating birds in N. Italy (Balducci et al. 1973). Arthropod vector is H. marginatum (TOT). Vertebrate hosts are passerine birds of the genera Oriolus, Muscicapa, Sylvia, Phylloscopus, Phoenicurus, Luscinia, Chloris, and Fringilla (Balducci et al. 1973; Watson et al. 1972). Human and animal disease caused by this virus has not been reported. European distribution: central and northern Italy. Outside Europe: Egypt, Cyprus. BAHV was isolated from larval H. marginatum rufipes collected on a northward migrating Oenanthe oenanthe in Egypt (Converse et al. 1974) which indicates a possible means of dispersal. Orthobunyavirus Matruh (MTRV) Tete antigenic group. Prototype: EgAn 1047–61 (Sylvia curruca blood, Egypt, 1961). European topotype: ISS.U.60 16 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 (F. coelebs blood, Italy, 1968). Related to BAHV by CFT and HIT. The virus was first isolated by J.R. Schmidt from migrat- ing passerines in Burg el Arab, Matruh Governorate, Egypt, 1961 (Theiler and Downs 1973). In Europe, it was recov- ered from migrating birds in North Italy (Balducci et al. 1973). Arthropod vector is probably H. marginatum. Vertebrate hosts are passerine birds of the genera Phyllo- scopus, Sylvia, Saxicola, Phoenicurus, Luscinia, Lanius, Serinus, Carduelis and Fringilla (Italy: Balducci et al. 1973), and C. coturnix. Human and animal disease caused by this virus has not been reported. European distribution: northern Italy. Outside Europe: Egypt, Cyprus. Phlebovirus Grand Arbaud (GAV), Phlebovirus Ponteves (PTVV) Uukuniemi antigenic group. GAV prototype: Argas-2 (Argas reflexus, Camargue, France, 1966). PTVV prototype: Larves-6 (A. reflexus, France, 1966). Both viruses are relat- ed, producing one-way reaction in cross-CFT. Also related to UUKV by CFT. The viruses were isolated only once from argasid ticks collected in a pigeon house in South France, 1966 (Hannoun et al. 1970). Arthropod vector is A. reflexus (TST, TOT in PTVV). Vertebrate host is probably pigeon. Animal and human disease caused by either GAV or PTVV has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 3. Outside Europe: unknown. Phlebovirus Uukuniemi (UUKV) Uukuniemi antigenic group. Synonyms: Poteplí virus; Sumakh virus. Prototype: S-23 (I. ricinus, Finland, 1960). Topotypes: Poteplí PO-63 (I. ricinus, Bohemia, 1963), Sumakh (Turdus merula heart and lungs, Azerbaijan, 1968). Hemagglutinin is produced, but not readily in all strains. The virus was originally isolated from I. ricinus collected from cattle at Uukuniemi, southeast Finland in 1959 (Oker-Blom et al. 1964), later (1963) in Central Bohemia as “Poteplí” virus (Kolman et al. 1966). Arthropod vectors are the ticks I. ricinus (TST, TOT: Samoilova and Voinov 1980), less commonly I. persulcatus. The virus was also isolated occasionally from mosquitoes Culex modestus, Aedes vexans, A. punctor, A. communis and Aedes cataphylla (Lvov et al. 1987, 1989; Vinograd et al. 1971)—but mosquitoes are obviously only mechanical vectors. Vertebrate hosts are forest rodents (Myodes glareolus, A. flavicollis: Kožuch et al. 1970a, b; Wróblewska- Mularczykowa et al. 1970; Vinograd et al. 1981) and birds, largely ground-feeding passerines (T. merula, Turdus philo- melos, T. iliacus, T. pilaris, Erithacus rubecula, Prunella modularis, Sylvia communis, O. oenanthe, S. vulgaris, C. corone, P. pica, F. coelebs, Coccothraustes coccothraustes, Emberiza citrinella, Streptopelia turtur, and Phasianus col- chicus: Gaidamovich et al. 1971; Hubálek 1994; Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Saikku 1974; Saikku and Brummer- Korvenkontio 1973; Vasilenko et al. 1975a, b; Vinograd et al. 1971, 1975). Viremia and long-term persistence of the virus was demonstrated in experimentally infected birds of many species. Antibodies were also detected in cows and reptiles. Fatal meningoencephalitis with myositis occurs in suckling mouse but no symptoms are observed in adult mouse (any route incl. s.c., i.n.) or adult rat (i.c.); also pathogenic to suckling but not adultM. arvalis, A. flavicollis orM. glareolus (i.c., usually not i.p.: Kožuch et al. 1970a, b) and suckling rat (i.c., not i.p.), and non-pathogenic for rhesus monkey inocu- lated i.p. (but lymphocytic meningitis appeared when UUKV was given i.c.: Grešíková et al. 1970). Animal and human disease caused by UUKV has not been reported. Antibodies were detected infrequently (≤5 % persons examined) in a few areas (Kolman et al. 1973; Málková et al. 1980; Molnár et al. 1976; Sekeyová et al. 1970; Vasilenko et al. 1975a, b) while only exceptionally at a higher frequency (e.g., 13–14 % in western Belarus and Hungary: Voinov 1978; Molnár et al. 1980), and much more often these serosurveys for UUKV were negative. European distribution: Fig. 3. Outside Europe: Azerbaijan, Asian Russia. Antibodies in Tunisia. Migra- tory birds play a role in the widespread distribution of UUKV; e.g., several strains of the virus have been isolated from immature I. ricinus collected on migratory passerines (Traavik 1979). Phlebovirus Zaliv Terpeniya (ZTV) Uukuniemi antigenic group. Prototype: LEIV-21C. Distantly related to UUK virus by CFT. Originally isolated from adult I. uriae collected in rocky breeding grounds of marine birds (U. aalge etc.) on Tyuleniy Island (Sakhalin region) and Commodore Islands (Kamchatka region), Russia in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1973a, b, c, d). In Europe, first isolated under similar conditions in theMurmansk region, North Russia in 1970 (Lvov et al. 1973a, b, c, d, 1989). Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST, TOT), rarely I. signatus. Occasional isolations from Ae. communis mosqui- toes in N.-European tundra (Lvov et al. 1987, 1989). Vertebrate hosts are U. lomvia, R. tridactyla. Antibodies were also detected in L. marinus and U. aalge. Some Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 17 mortality (acute viral encephalitis) has been observed in chickens inoculated i.c. or s.c. (Chastel 1988). Animal and human disease caused by ZTV has not been reported. Antibodies rarely occur in farmers who have lived near Cap Sizun (Chastel 1988). European distribution: Fig. 4. Outside Europe: E. and N. Asian Russia (Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Taimyr), NW. Canada and USA. Phlebovirus St. Abb's Head (SAHV) Uukuniemi antigenic group. A non-registered virus (isolates GM710 and M349) that involves a number of closely related (SAHV-like) strains. Prototype: M-349 (I. uriae, North Scotland, 1979). First isolated from adult I. uriae and the blood and organs of moribund juvenile kittiwakes (R. tridactyla) collected on breeding grounds off N. Scotland, 1979 (Nuttall et al. 1981) and NE. England (Eley and Nuttall 1984). Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST) and I. rothschildi (Nuttall et al. 1984a). Main vertebrate host is kittiwake R. tridactyla. An illness in juvenile kittiwakes has repeatedly been observed. Antibodies have also been detected in U. aalge, Alca torda, and other marine birds (Nuttall 1984; Nuttall et al. 1984a). A relatively low mortality of suckling mice was observed at i.c. inocula- tion (Nuttall et al. 1984b; Moss and Nuttall 1985). Human disease caused by SAHV has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 4. Labuda and Nuttall (2004) list a number of additional uukuvirus-like isolates from I. uriae ticks collected from European colonial seabird habitats, that may belong either to SAHVor ZTV, or some of them possibly to a novel virus: Arbroath ARB2, (Scotland), Ellidaey ELL-1,-2,-4 (Iceland), Flatholm (Iceland), Foula F89-1 (Shetland Islands), Great Saltee Island GS80-4,-10,-11 (SE. Ireland), Isle of May M320/79, M326/79, M34-81, M35-81 (Scotland), Marsden (England), Rost Islands NorV-697,-707,-820-868 (Norway), Runde Island Ru E82 (Norway), Soay (Scotland–St. Kilda). Nairovirus Soldado (SOLV) Hughes antigenic group. Prototype: TRVL-52214 (Ornithodoros capensis/denmarki, Trinidad, 1963). European topotypes: EgAr-3608 (O. maritimus, N. Wales, 1974) and Brest-Ar/T13 (O. maritimus, France, 1977). A remarkable antigenic heterogeneity of SOLV isolates has been found by CFT; in fact, some European (French, Irish) isolates differ from the prototype strain more than eightfold in reciprocal titres (Chastel et al. 1983). SOLV is distantly related to Zirqa and Punta Salinas viruses of the Hughes serogroup by CFT, VNT, and IFA (Converse et al. 1976; Yunker et al. 1977). The virus is very stable at pH 3. SOLV was originally isolated from mixed nymphal O. capensis and O. denmarki ticks infesting Anous stolidus colonies on Soldado Rock near Trinidad, 1963 (Jonkers et al. 1973). In Europe, it was recovered from O. maritimus infesting L. argentatus nests on Puffin Island (N. Wales: Converse et al. 1976), Ireland (Keirans et al. 1976), England (Nuttall et al. 1986), and Cap Fréhel and Cap Sizun (Brittany, France: Chastel et al. 1979, 1981a, b, 1988a, b; Quillien et al. 1986). Fig. 4 European distribution of Zaliv Terpeniya (circles) and St. Abb's Head (squares) viruses 18 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 Arthropod vector is O. maritimus (TST; the mean infec- tion rate of vector ticks can be as high as 20 %: Johnson et al. 1979) in Europe, while O. capensis elsewhere. Vertebrate hosts are seabirds Sterna fuscata, L. argenta- tus, and R. tridactyla (Chastel et al. 1990). Antibodies were also detected in Larus cachinnans, Larus cirrhocephalus, Phalacrocorax aristotelis, and other species. Mortality due to SOLV was observed in young seabirds such as S. fuscata or L. argentatus (Converse et al. 1975; Chastel et al. 1990). Infected O. capensis have transmitted the virus to domestic chicks and caused their death on days 5 to 8 post-feeding (Converse et al. 1975). Natural foci are seabird colonies (usually on rocky off- shore islands). Ornithologists bitten by O. capensis in the Seychelles experienced severe pruritus persisting for a few days (Converse et al. 1975); the etiology has remained unclear in that a possible cutaneous reaction to tick bites could not be excluded. A case of febrile illness with persistent rhino- pharyngitis and pruritus due to SOLV was observed in a scientist who had been repeatedly bitten by O. maritimus in Morocco (Chastel et al. 1981a, b). However, antibodies rarely occur in farmers who live near Cap Sizun (Chastel 1988). The related Zirqa and Punta Salinas viruses may cause fever with headache, pruritus, and erythema in people in the Arabian Gulf and Peru, respectively (Converse et al. 1975, 1976). European distribution: Fig. 5. Outside Europe: Trinidad, Ethiopia, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Morocco, USA (Hawaii, Texas). Seabird migrations account for the widespread distribution of SOLV (Converse et al. 1975). A number of additional Hughes group SOLV-like isolates from I. uriae ticks collected from European colonial seabird hab- itats were reported (Labuda and Nuttall 2004): Ellidaey ELL81-3b (Iceland), Foule F80-1 (Shetland Islands), Great Saltee 59972, GS80-3 (Ireland), Grimsey G82-1b (Iceland), Inner Farne IF80-3,-4 (England), Isle of May (Scotland). Nairovirus Puffin Island (PIV) Hughes antigenic group. Prototype: 9617 (O. maritimus, Wales, 1974); other similar isolates are EgArt 608, 3615, 3616 (Wales), and Petticko Wick (Scotland: Labuda and Nuttall 2004). A non-registered virus composed of strains closely related to SOLV but distinguishable by IFA and VNT (Gould et al. 1983). The virus is very sensitive at pH 3. PIV was first isolated from argasid ticks collected in L. argentatus nests on Puffin Island, N. Wales in 1974 and originally referred to as SOLV, but re-identified as a new virus later (Gould et al. 1983). Arthropod vector is O. maritimus, but several Icelandic and British isolates have been recovered also from I. uriae. Vertebrate hosts are L. argentatus and F. arctica. Anti- bodies were also detected in U. aalge, A. torda, and other seabirds. Animal and human disease caused by PIV has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 5 In addition, antigenically closely related virus strains were isolated in Ireland (GS-80-3: Fig. 5 European distribution of Soldado (circles) and Puffin Island (asterisks) nairoviruses Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 19 Nuttall et al. 1984a), Britain (Nuttall et al. 1986) and Iceland (GRIMS82-1b, ELL-3b: Moss et al. 1986). Nairovirus Avalon (AVAV) Sakhalin antigenic group. Synonym: Paramushir virus. Dis- tantly related to Sakhalin virus (SAKV) by CFT (Main et al. 1976a, b). Prototype: CanAr-173 (I. uriae, Newfoundland, 1972). Topotype: LEIV-2268Ku (“Paramushir”: I. signatus, Paramushir Island, Far East, 1969). First isolated from engorged adult and nymphal I. uriae collected in a L. argentatus nest on Great Island, Newfound- land, Canada in 1972 (Main et al. 1976a, b). “Paramushir” virus was isolated from I. uriae and I. signatus collected from seabird colonies in the Far East in fact earlier, in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1976). In Europe, several strains of AVAV were isolated from I. uriae collected in Cap Sizun, Brittany, France in 1979 (Chastel et al. 1981a, b; Quillien et al. 1986). The virus is stable at pH 3, but some strains might be acid labile (Quillien et al. 1986); heat sensitive (inactivated at 56°C within 30 m). Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST) and I. signatus. The vertebrate host is L. argentatus (Main et al. 1976a, b). Antibodies were also detected in F. arctica, Oceanodroma leucorrhoa, Larus marinus. Spontaneous animal disease is unknown. Although fatal to suckling mouse (i.c.), the survival is long and the titres in suckling mouse brain are rather low. Natural foci are seabird colonies on cliffs. Three human cases of cervical adenopathy were described in France (Chastel 1985). However, antibodies in humans occur rarely: only 1 % of farmers who had lived near Cap Sizun were seropositive (Quillien et al. 1986). European distribution: Fig. 6. Outside Europe: Asian Russia (Far East), Canada. Nairovirus Clo Mor (CMV) Sakhalin antigenic group. Prototype: ScotAr-7 (I. uriae, Scotland, 1973). Closely related to SAKV (prototype LEIV-71c: I. uriae, Far East, 1970–Lvov et al. 1972), the difference in titres being only three to fourfold in cross-CFT (Main et al. 1976a, b). CMV may be regarded as a subtype of SAKV. First isolated from engorged nymphal I. uriae collected in a U. aalge colony at Clo Mor, Cape Wrath, Scotland in 1973 (Main et al. 1976a, b). The virus is very stable at pH 3 (>3 h at 4°C). HA is occasionally produced in suckling mouse brain. Arthropod vector is I. uriae (TOT: Lvov et al. 1972). Vertebrate hosts are unknown (possibly seabirds, but antibodies have not yet been detected in them). Fatal to suckling mouse (s.c.) but not to adult mouse (s.c.) or chicks (i.c.). Suckling mice are relatively insensitive for the isolation attempts (Nuttall et al. 1984b). Moreover, CMV is poorly immunogenic in mouse at i.p. or i.c. inoculation. Human disease caused by CMV has not been reported; no antibodies have been detected in humans. European distribution: Fig. 6. Outside Europe: Asian Russia (northern Far East). Two strains similar to CMV were reported (Labuda and Nuttall 2004) from I. uriae ticks in seabird colonies: Old Copper Mine (England–Lundy) and Shiant Islands M325 isolate (Scotland). Nairovirus of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV) Synonyms: Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CHF) virus; Congo (CON) virus. Prototype: Khodzha (human blood from a fatal case, Uzbekistan, 1967). African topotype: V-3011 (human blood, Zaire, 1956–registered in 1969). European topotype: Drozdov (human blood, southern Russia, 1967). The disease (hemorrhagic fever) was first mentioned by Tadjik physician Abu-Ibrahim Djurdjani in the 12th century (Shapiro and Barkaghan 1960). It has been extensively studied since the 1944/45 epidemic (more than 200 human cases, c. 10 % were fatal) in the Crimean peninsula and called “Crimean hemorrhagic fever”. Mikhail P. Chumakov and co-workers demonstrated viral etiology of the disease by experimental infection of a volunteer with an ultrafiltrate of homogenized nymphal H. marginatum ticks collected from local hares in 1945 (Chumakov 1974). CHF virus was first isolated from patients in Astrakhan, Rostov and Uzbekistan in 1967 (Butenko et al. 1968; Chumakov et al. 1971), and from ticks in Crimea in 1972–73 (Chumakov 1974), while CON virus was recovered earlier by G. Cour- tois from a patient in Zaire (Congo) in 1956 (Simpson et al. 1967). It was recognized that CONV is identical to CHFV (Casals 1969), and Harry Hoogstraal proposed the com- bined name of the virus and disease–CCHF (Hoogstraal 1979). Arthropod vectors (and also a reservoir of CCHFV) are metastriate ixodid ticks—H. marginatum (TST, TOT), H. rufipes (TOT, Africa), H. turanicum (Asia), H. truncatum (TST, TOT), H. asiaticum, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. exca- vatum, H. detritum, H. nitidum, H. impeltatum, H. impres- sum, H. lusitanicum (Spain), H. punctata (Europe), Rhipicephalus bursa (Europe), R. sanguineus (Europe), R. rossicus (South Russia, TOT: Kondratenko 1976), R. pum- ilio, R. pulchellus, R. turanicus, D. marginatus (Europe, TOT: Kondratenko 1976), D. daghestanicus, Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus annulatus (syn. B. calcaratus: Bulgaria, Russia), B. decoloratus and B. microplus (Pakistan). Much less frequent vectors are prostriate ticks (subfamily Ixodinae): I. ricinus (few CCHFV isolations in Crimea, Moldavia, Bulgaria and Hungary). Occasional vectors outside Europe can be soft ticks Argas persicus (Uzbekistan) and Ornithodoros (Alveonasus) lahorensis (Iran). 20 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 Vertebrate hosts are leporids, hedgehog, other small mammals, cattle, horse, goat, sheep. There is inapparent course of the CCHF infection in mammals, and birds are refractory to experimental infection. Fatal to suckling rat (i.c. but not i.p.) and newborn cotton rat (i.c., i.p.). No mortality in adult rat (i.p., s.c.), rabbit (i.p., s.c.; some symptoms after i.c.), hare Lepus europaeus (i.v., s.c.), Cit- ellus pygmaeus (i.c., s.c.), rhesus monkey i.p. (rash only), sheep (s.c., i.p.), calf (i.v.), donkey and horse (i.v., s.c.). Plaques (and/or indistinct CPE) produced in primary Cercopithecus kidney cells. Usually no multiplication in BSC-1, HEp-2, and primary mouse embryo (David-West 1971, 1972). Natural foci of CCHF are typically xerothermic, mostly open habitats with shrub and dispersed or solitary trees. CCHF is transmitted mostly by bite of an infective tick, at removal of feeding ticks, but also during shearing of sheep with attached infectious ticks, slaughtering of infected animals (livestock-to-human transmission), or by direct con- tact with a human patient, e.g., at nursing and care for patients (human-to-human transmission). CCHF is highly contagious, and many hospital, household and laboratory infections (including fatal) have been described. For in- stance, 6 % of the human CCHF cases recorded in Bulgaria were nosocomial. A much greater proportion of nosocomial and family infections occur in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Pakistan, usually with a high mortality rate (Hoogstraal 1979). CCHF may be an occupational dis- ease in cattle breeders, butchers, livestock industry, health professionals (nosocomial spread), laboratory workers (aerosol). Human disease: CCHF is characterized by an abrupt onset with fever (3–16 days, often biphasic), chills, general weakness, severe headache, myalgia, neckache, back pains, generalized arthralgia, hyperemia of the face, neck and chest, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, abdominal and epigastric pains, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, stiffness, diarrhea, pho- tophobia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, dizzi- ness, psychotic signs (depression, sleepiness, lassitude), bradycardia, hemorrhagic manifestations (from petechial rash on the trunk to large hematomas on the mucous mem- branes and skin, bleeding from mucous membranes—gums, nose, intestine and lungs or kidney; sometimes bleeding into brain), liver failure, pulmonary failure, hemorrhagic shock. Laboratory findings include increased levels of transami- nases, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Long convalescence (common problems are asthenia, hair loss, rapid fatigability, sweating, headache, poor vision and hearing), but without residua. Fatality rate is 3–30 % (but in nosocomial infections up to 50 %). In south-eastern Europe, several outbreaks of CCHF have been recorded since the 1950s: e.g., 1,568 cases were noti- fied in Bulgaria from 1953 to 2008, with a mean fatality rate of 17 %. Since 1999 (but especially in 2006–07), a reacti- vation of natural foci and re-emergence of CCHF occurred in Kosovo (119 cases during 1995–2001), southern Russia (regions Stavropol, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, Kalmy- kia, Dagestan:—a total of >1,300 patients were diagnosed with CCHF from 1999 until 2007, the fatality rate being 3–5 %. Albania reported eight CCHF cases in 2001, addi- tional cases in 2003–2006. A surprising, continuous epi- demic process started in the Asian part of Turkey in 2002, Fig. 6 European distribution of Avalon (circles) and Clo Mor (asterisks) nairoviruses Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 21 and until 2009, a total of 4,430 human cases were reported from 680 settlements mainly in the Tokat and Sivas prov- inces (but as many as 2,615 cases were notified solely in the last 2 years 2008 and 2009), with a mean overall fatality rate of 5 %; in addition, 16 % of healthy population have anti- bodies to CCHF virus in Turkey at present (most often farmers and village residents). This exceptional epidemio- logical upsurge of CCHF in Turkey (largely in north-east Anatolia in the Asian part of the country) has been associ- ated ecologically with fragmentation and use of agricultural land and the formation, by this way, of optimal habitats for H. marginatum vector ticks (Maltezou and Papa 2010). Some other recent epidemics outside Europe: Iran 248 cases between 2000 and 2004; Mauretania 38 cases (11 fatal) in 2003. In 2009, human cases of CCHF were also reported from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Diagnosis: RT-PCR, detection of antibodies or antigen (ELISA, IFA), isolation of the virus (extreme risk). Treatment: in acute phase (if diagnosed very early) riba- virin though its efficacy has not been unequivocally con- firmed in clinical studies. Specific immunoglobulins can be used prophylactically or therapeutically, but only in the first days after infection (Vasilev et al. 1991). Prevention: a vaccine of Bulgarian provenience (inacti- vated, suckling mouse brains; not commercial, a small scale production) has been successfully applied to several hun- dred persons in the Rostov region and Bulgaria (Vasilenko et al. 1975a, b). European distribution: Fig. 7. Outside Europe: Asian part of Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Somalia, Senegal, Guinea, Uganda, Zaire (Congo), Nigeria, Central Africa, Mauritania, Upper Volta, Kenya, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), S. Africa, Madagascar. Antibodies have been detected in India, Egypt, and Tanzania. Livestock movements and migratory birds play an important role in the transport of infected vector ticks to other areas. For instance, CCHF virus was isolated from nymphal H. marginatum removed from Cor- vus frugilegus, Passer montanus, Galerida cristata, and Tockus erythrorhynchus in Rostov, Astrakhan, Kirghizia and Senegal, respectively (Hoogstraal 1979; Wood et al. 1978; Zeller et al. 1994a, b). Bhanja Bunyavirus (BHAV) This virus is, together with two other African tick-borne viruses Kismayo (Butenko et al. 1979) and Forécariah (Boiro et al. 1986), a member of Bhanja group that has not yet been assigned to a recognized genus of the family Bunyaviridae. Synonym or subtype: Palma virus (PoTi- 4.92 strain, isolated from male H. punctata in Portugal, 1992: Filipe et al. 1994); the mean cross-PRNT titre differ- ences among European, Indian and African strains of BHA have been found as great as four to tenfold (Hubálek and Halouzka 1985). BHAV was isolated first from Haemaphysalis intermedia (syn. H. parva) ticks that had been collected from a para- lyzed goat in Bhanjanagar (district Ganjam, Orissa State, India) in 1954 (prototype strain IG-690), but the record was Fig. 7 European distribution of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever nairovirus. The dotted line shows the northern limits of the Hyalomma marginatum area in Europe 22 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 published much later (Shah and Work 1969). In Europe, the first isolation was from adult H. punctata collected in Italy, 1967 (European topotype ISS.IR.205: Verani et al. 1970a, b), then in Croatia (Vesenjak-Hirjan et al. 1977) and Bulgaria (Pavlov et al. 1978). The virus is transmitted by metastriate ixodid ticks of several species—in Europe H. punctata, Haemaphysalis sulcata, and D. marginatus; elsewhere H. intermedia, Boo- philus decoloratus, B. annulatus, B. geigyi, A. variegatum, H. marginatum, H. detritum, H. dromedarii, H. truncatum, R. bursa, and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Experimental transmission including TOT was demonstrated in H. asiat- icum (Gaidamovich et al. 1976). Vertebrate hosts for BHAV are sheep, goat (Verani et al. 1971), cattle; in Africa, BHAV was also isolated from the four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) and striped ground squirrel (Xerus erythropus). Antibodies were detected in dogs, C. elaphus, C. capreolus, and Sus scrofa (Punda et al. 1986). The virus does not usually cause apparent infection in adult animals but is pathogenic for young ruminants (lamb, kid, calf), causing fever and CNS affection (meningoencephalitis), or leucopenia in cattle (Theiler and Downs 1973; Hubálek 1987; Semashko et al. 1976; Camicas et al. 1981; Mádr et al. 1984). Experimental encephalitis was produced in rhesus monkey (Balducci et al. 1970; Verani et al. 1970b). Fatal to suckling mouse i.n. and adult mouse (i.c., i.n., but not s.c., i.v., p.o., or per conjunctivae). Encephalitis in lamb (i.c., but not s.c. or i.v.: Semashko et al. 1976; Mádr et al. 1984) and rhesus monkey (i.c.: Balducci et al. 1970). Not fatal to adult goat (s.c.), rabbit (i.c., i.n., s.c., i.v., i.m., p.o.; a low viremia), and several passerine birds. Faint CPE and plaques produced in BSC-1, RK-13, and primary mouse embryo (David-West 1971) cells, while multipli- cation without CPE in HEp-2 cells (David-West 1972). Natural foci of BHAV are boskematic—pastoral steppe or forest-steppe ecosystems in xerothermic areas or in karst habitats at more northern latitudes. Based on a comparison of several known natural foci of BHAV infection, their com- mon and typical features were extracted and bio-indicator species (plants, animals) were selected that can be used for prediction of potential presence of BHAV in other geographic areas within Europe (Hubálek 2009). BHAV causes in human febrile illness with headache, conjunctivitis, or sometimes meningoencephalitis with pho- tophobia, vomiting, and pareses. About ten natural and/or laboratory infections with BHAV have been described in humans, one of them serious—quadriparesis (Calisher and Goodpasture 1975; Punda et al. 1980; Vesenjak-Hirjan et al. 1980). There is some occupational risk for shepherds and veterinary personnel. Probably an underdiagnosed disease in the Mediterranean and Balkan countries. European distribution: Fig. 8. Outside Europe: India, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Senegal, Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central Africa, Kenya, Somalia. Antibodies were detected in Srí Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, and Tunisia. Migratory birds might play a role in the transport of infected immature ticks to distant areas. Family Reoviridae Coltivirus Eyach (EYAV) A member of Colorado tick fever (CTF) group. Serologi- cally closely related to North-American CTFV by CFT and VNT; however, CTFV is not neutralized with anti-EYA serum. First isolated from I. ricinus ticks collected at Eyach near Tübbingen, Germany, 1972 (prototype: Eyach-38: Rehse-Küpper et al. 1976), later (1981) from I. ricinus and Ixodes ventalloi collected on a wild rabbit in NW. France (Chastel et al. 1984). There is a hypothesis that this virus, a descendant of CTF agent, could have been imported from North America with U.S. Army dogs and their Dermacentor ticks to a military base situated in Germany after the 2nd WW, and evolved into Eyach virus under the selective pressure of European ecosystem (Hubálek and Rudolf 2011). Another hypothesis suggests that CTFV could have been introduced to Europe with cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus floridanus (Attoui et al. 1998). The dsRNA of EYAV consists of 12 segments, in contrast to the genus Orbivirus with ten segments. Very sensitive to trypsin, acid, and heat (60°C). Arthropod vectors are ticks I. ricinus (TST) and I. ventalloi. Vertebrate hosts are rodents (they reveal prolonged experimental viremias) and lagomorphs (Oryctolagus cuni- culus). Animal infection has an inapparent course, but meningoencephalitis in suckling mouse (i.c.) has been dem- onstrated histologically. Serological data indicate possible association (not yet reliably demonstrated) of EYAV with human neuropathies including five patients with meningoencephalitis (Málková et al. 1980; Fraňková 1981); additional investigation is necessary. The closely related CTF virus (principal vector is Dermacentor andersoni) causes acute febrile illness in the mountainous northwestern parts of North America, with a number of cases each year. Diagnosis: serology (IgM ELISA, IFA, VNT; but not HIT); virus isolation. European distribution: Fig. 9. Orbivirus Tribeč (TRBV) Synonyms (or subtypes): Lipovník (LIP-91, I. ricinus, East Slovakia, 1963), Koliba, Cvilín (Libíková et al. 1965, Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 23 1977), Brezová (subtype: Hubálek et al. 1987a, b), Mircha (strain “634”: Vinograd et al. 1977), Kharagysh (Skofertsa et al. 1972). Member of Kemerovo antigenic group, and the Kemerovo subgroup (Belhouchet et al. 2010). Contrary to coltiviruses, orbiviruses of the Kemerovo group have only 10 segments of dsRNAwith a total size of 19 kbp. Prototype strain: Tribeč (I. ricinus, West Slovakia, 1963). Closely related to the Siberian Kemerovo virus by CFT but distinguishable by VNT (Libíková and Buckley 1971; Libíková and Casals 1971) or RNA-RNA hybridization (Brown et al. 1988). Gene pools of the Kemerovo group and other orbiviruses have a great reassortment potential (because of the segmented dsRNA) and resulting biological variability (Gorman et al. 1978, 1983; Gorman 1983; Brown et al. 1988, 1989). Inter- estingly, rabbit syncytium virus that occurs in S. floridanus rabbit in the USA is also closely related to TRBV. First 28 strains of TRBV were isolated from I. ricinus in three regions of Slovakia in 1963; a few strains had been Fig. 8 European distribution of Bhanja virus. Explanation: black dots, the virus isolation; asterisk, Palma virus (a subtype of BHAV). The dotted line shows predicted northern limits of the Bhanja virus area in Europe, based on the presence of bio-indicators (Hubálek 2009) and largely compatible with the range of Haemaphysa- lis punctata and Dermacentor marginatus vector ticks Fig. 9 European distribution of Eyach coltivirus 24 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 isolated already in 1961 but lost thereafter (Libíková 1964; Libíková et al. 1964, 1965; Grešíková et al. 1965). Nearly resistant to diethyl ether and sodium deoxycholate but very sensitive to acid (even pH 5–6), alkali (pH 10) and trypsin. TRBV is transmitted by ticks I. ricinus (TST) and I. persulcatus, occasionally by H. punctata (Topciu et al. 1968). Vertebrate hosts of TRBV are rodents, e.g., M. glareolus and M. subterraneus (Grešíková et al. 1965), hare L. euro- paeus (Dobler et al. 2006), goat (Grešíková et al. 1965), European starling S. vulgaris and chaffinch F. coelebs (Skofertsa et al. 1974, 1976). Antibodies are present very often in grazed ruminants in endemic areas (up to 45–88 % reactors: Hubálek et al. 1986). Animal disease is unknown (inapparent). However, TRBV is fatal to suckling mouse (also s.c.: meningoencephalitis—progressive neuronal and glial damage with perivascular infiltration), suckling rat, and suckling Syrian hamster (i.c., but not s.c.). Meningitis but survival or no symptoms at all in adult mouse inoculated i.c. (but local necrotizing encephalitis demonstrated histologi- cally), while no symptoms in adult mouse given s.c., i.n. or p.o., adult rat (i.c.), rabbit (i.c.), and peripherally inoculated calf or foal. Fever and meningitis are present in rhesus monkey inoculated i.c. (Grešíková et al. 1966). The virus causes an occasional febrile illness or aseptic meningitis in humans—e.g., at least 15 patients with the CNS infection (meningitis) revealed seroconversion against TRBV in Czechland (Fraňková 1981; Málková et al. 1986; Hubálek et al. 1987a, b). Antibodies occur in human popu- lation, interestingly at a higher frequency among patients with multiple sclerosis (Libíková et al. 1978). There is potential occupational risk for forestry workers. The disease caused by TRBV is probably underdiagnosed. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the public health impor- tance of TRBV. Diagnosis: serology (CFT, VNT; but not HIT because these viruses do not produce hemagglutinin). Therefore, HIT (and ELISA) cannot be normally used in diagnostic serology. European distribution: Fig. 10 Outside Europe TRBV was isolated exceptionally in northern Africa. Migratory birds have been implicated in the dispersal of Kemerovo serogroup viruses over vast distances. For instance, the Siberian Kemerovo virus was isolated from a southward migrating Phoenicurus phoenicurus in Egypt (Schmidt and Shope 1971; Brown et al. 1988). Orbivirus Okhotskiy (OKHV) Kemerovo antigenic group, the Great Island (GI) subgroup. Prototype: LEIV-70C (I. uriae, Tyuleniy Island—Far East, 1970). Antigenically and genetically closely related to other Kemerovo group and especially GI subgroup viruses; prob- ably identical with CWV because it hybridizes to all ten OKHV genes. The GI complex viruses may represent a single viral gene pool, i.e., one species (Brown et al. 1989; Belhouchet et al. 2010). OKHV was originally isolated from nymphal I. uriae collected in rocky breeding grounds of seabirds on Tyuleniy Island, Sea of Okhotsk (Russian Far East) in 1970 (Lvov et al. 1973a, b, c, d). In Europe, it was isolated under similar conditions in the Murmansk region, N. Russia, 1970 (Lvov et al. 1989). The main arthropod vector is I. uriae (TST, TOT), occa- sionally I. signatus. Vertebrate hosts are seabirds: R. tridactyla; antibodies were also detected in F. glacialis, U. aalge, and Phalacro- corax pelagicus. Avian disease is unknown. Human disease has not been reported, although antibod- ies were detected in 12 % of inhabitants on the Commodore Islands. European distribution: Fig. 11 Outside Europe: coastal Asian Russia (Far East), USA and Canada. Seabirds dis- perse the GI complex viruses transoceanically and introduce them to new areas and new hosts; the GI members therefore occur both in subarctic and subantarctic regions (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979). Orbivirus Cape Wrath (CWV) Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype: ScotAr-20 (CW-20; I. uriae, Scotland, 1973). Antigenically and genetically closely related to GI, BAU, MYK, TDM, OKH, Nugget and Yaquina Head viruses; In fact, probably identical with (i.e., a synonym of) Okhotskiy virus because it hybridizes to all ten OKH genes (Brown et al. 1989). Very similar or identical non-registered viruses are Arbroath (ARB- 1, Scotland: Moss and Nuttall 1985), Broadhaven (FT-363: Carey and Nuttall 1989; Jacobs et al. 1986; Nuttall et al. 1981, 1990a, b), Wexford (GS-80-9, SE. Ireland: Nuttall et al. 1984a; Carey and Nuttall 1989), Thormodseyjarklettur (Iceland), Scottish strains Mill Door/79, Above Maiden, Colony, Foula, Mill Door, North Clett, and Shiant Islands, Irish Great Saltee Island GS 80-4,-7,-8, Ellidaye ELL-3a and Grimsey (Iceland), English isolates Lundy, Inner Farne IF79- 1,-2, and North End, Rost Islands NorV-808,-871,-962, and Vaeroy (Norway—Lofoten), and a number of other strains (Jacobs et al. 1986; Labuda and Nuttall 2004). Some of these viruses can be differentiated in PRNT (Carey and Nuttall 1989), but they reassort readily at a high frequency (Moss et al. 1988; Nuttall et al. 1990a, b; Nuttall and Moss 1989). Only minor variability has also been found in the induced protein profiles among different CWVand CWV-like isolates (Black et al. 1986; Spence et al. 1986). The gene reassortment potential of the isolates confirms the close taxonomic Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 25 relationship of all the GI subgroup members which may, in fact, represent a single gene pool (Moss et al. 1988; Brown et al. 1989; Nuttall et al. 1990a) and therefore one virus species. First isolated from engorged female I. uriae collected in a colony of the common murre U. aalge at Clo Mor on Cape Wrath, Scotland, June 1973 (Main et al. 1976a, b). The virus is sensitive to trypsin and acid (pH 3) but resistant at pH 5. Arthropod vector is I. uriae. Vertebrate hosts are marine birds. Antibodies were detected inU. aalge, A. torda, andO. leucorrhoa (Main et al. 1976a, b; Nuttall et al. 1984a, b). However, avian disease is unknown. Suckling mouse is a rather insusceptible system for the CWV isolation attempts (Nuttall et al. 1984a, b). Human disease has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 11. Outside Europe: Alaska. Fig. 10 European distribution of Tribeč virus. Explanation: black dots, the virus isolation; white circles, specific antibodies detected Fig. 11 European distribution of the Great Island subgroup orbiviruses: Cape Wrath and CW-like (circles), Okhotskiy (squares), Mykines (asterisk), Tindholmur (asterisk) and Bau- line (diamond) viruses 26 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 Orbivirus Mykines (MYKV) and Tindholmur (TDMV) Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype MYKV is DenAr-12 (I. uriae, Faeroe Islands, 1974), and TDMV DenAr-2 (I. uriae, Faeroe Islands, 1974). Both viruses are distinguishable by CFT, and antigenically related to CWV, GIV, BAUV, Yaquina Head, OKHV and other GI subgroup viruses (Brown et al. 1989). First isolates originated from female I. uriae ticks col- lected in puffin (F. arctica) colonies at Mykines and Tindholmur, Faeroe Islands in 1974 (Main 1978). Arthropod vectors: I. uriae. Vertebrate hosts: probably F. arctica. Animal and human disease has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 11. Orbivirus Bauline (BAUV) Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype: CanAr-14 (I. uriae, Canada, 1971). European topotype: FI- 873 (I. uriae, Norway, 1974). The Norwegian isolates FI- 873 and FI-962 have been found identical with prototype BAUV by RNA–RNA hybridization (Brown et al. 1989). Antigenically closely related to other members of the GI or Kemerovo subgroups (Brown et al. 1989), and indistin- guishable from GI virus (CanAr-41) by CFT; both viruses can be differentiated by VNT (Main et al. 1973). Some BAUVand GIV isolates from Newfoundland have exhibited a remarkable variation in all ten genome segments (Oprandy et al. 1988). Originally isolated from engorged nymphal I. uriae ticks collected during July 1971 in a F. arctica colony on Great Island off the SE. coast of Newfoundland, Canada (Main et al. 1973). In Europe, it was isolated from I. uriae collected in a seabird colony on Rost Island, Lofoten (Norway) in 1974 (Brown et al. 1989; Saikku et al. 1980). Vertebrate hosts are unknown; antibodies were detected in F. arctica and O. leucorrhoa birds. Animal and human disease has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 11. Outside Europe: Canada (Newfoundland). Documented transoceanic flights of puf- fins from NW. Europe to Newfoundland and vice versa contribute to the dissemination of the GI subgroup viruses over wide geographical areas (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Main et al. 1973). Family Orthomyxoviridae Thogotovirus Thogoto (THOV) Thogoto antigenic group. Prototype: Ken-IIA (mixed metas- triate tick spp., Kenya, 1960). African topotype: IbAr-2012 (Boophilus spp., Nigeria, 1964); European topotype: SiAr- 126 (R. bursa, Sicily, 1969). THOV shares only 15–20 % nucleotide homology with influenza orthomyxoviruses. Virions are spherical, 80–120 nm, enveloped, contain ss(−) RNA arranged in six segments with a total size of 10 kbp, and one surface glycoprotein. Some strains form HA in the liver and blood serum of SM or in Vero cells, whereas not in suckling mouse brain. First isolated from a pool of B. decoloratus and Rhipice- phalus spp. ticks collected on cattle in Thogoto Forest near Nairobi, Kenya in 1960 (Haig et al. 1965). In Europe, it was first isolated from ticks collected on ruminants in Sicily, 1969 (Albanese et al. 1971, 1972; Srihongse et al. 1974) and then in Portugal in 1978 (Filipe and Calisher 1984). Arthropod vectors are metastriate ticks only—B. decol- oratus, B. annulatus, A. variegatum, R. appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Portugal), R. bursa (Sicily), Rhi- picephalus evertsi, other Rhipicephalus spp., Hyalomma truncatum, and H. anatolicum. Vertebrate hosts are cattle, camel, and man (isolations in Africa). Antibodies were also detected in sheep and goat. THOV causes leucopenia in cattle, and fever, and abortion in sheep (Davies et al. 1984). Fatal to, and highly hepato- tropic or pantropic in, adult mouse (Filipe et al. 1986) and adult Syrian hamster (i.p.). No symptoms in suckling ham- ster and rabbit (i.p.). CPE is produced in primary mouse embryo and lamb testis cells; faint CPE in HEp-2 cells (David-West 1971, 1972). Natural foci are boskematic—pastoral xerothermic ecosystems. Human disease: two cases have been described, one with bilateral optic neuritis and another as a fatal meningoen- cephalitis with hepatitis although complicated by a sickle- cell disease (Theiler and Downs 1973; Moore et al. 1975). THOV is probably contagious from man to man. Antibodies occur rarely in human sera in Europe: e.g., only 1 % sero- positive persons were detected in Portugal (Filipe et al. 1985). European distribution: Fig. 12. Outside Europe THOV occurs in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Central Africa, Egypt, Iran. Tick-infested domestic animals (e.g., camels) and migratory birds could disseminate the virus over a wide geographic range (Calisher et al. 1987). Thogotovirus Dhori (DHOV) Prototype: IG-611313 (Hyalomma dromedarii, India, 1961). European topotype: PoTi-461 “Vidigueira” (male H. mar- ginatum, Portugal, 1971). Synonyms: Astra (Butenko and Chumakov 1971), Batken (LEIV-306 K: H. marginatum, collected on sheep in Kirghizia, 1970: Lvov et al. 1974). Nucleotide sequence data suggest that DHOV is distantly related to influenza viruses but their envelope proteins (HA, neuraminidase) differ significantly. Virions are spherical, Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 27 80–120 nm, enveloped, contain ss(−)RNA arranged in 7 segments with a total size of 10 kbp, and one surface glycoprotein. HA is also produced in Vero cells, and HIT can use goose, sheep, monkey or human RBC. DHOV was first isolated from Hyalomma dromedarii ticks collected on camels in Dhori, Gujarat State, India in 1961 (Anderson and Casals 1973). In Europe, it has been isolated several times from Hyalomma marginatum and twice from Hyalomma scupense collected at Astrakhan, South Russia since 1969 (as “Astra” virus: (Butenko and Chumakov 1971; Butenko et al. 1987; Bannova et al. 1974; Smirnova et al. 1988) and in Crimea (one strain —“Batken”); additional two strains were obtained from H. scupense near Astrakhan (Smirnova et al. 1988) and another one in southern Portugal, 1971 (Filipe and Casals 1979). Arthropod vectors are metastriate ticks H. dromedarii, H. marginatum (Europe), H. scupense and D. marginatus. Oc- casional isolations of DHOV were reported from Ornitho- doros lahorensis and mosquitoes (Anopheles hyrcanus, Aedes caspius, Culex hortensis). Vertebrate hosts are camel, horse, bats (Kirghizia), but animal disease is unknown (asymptomatic). Antibodies have also been detected in goats, sheep and cattle (Filipe et al. 1985). DHOV is hepatotropic, and causing diffuse necrosis of neurons in mouse (Filipe et al. 1990). No symp- toms were observed in inoculated adult or young rabbit (i.c., i.p., s.c.). No CPE or plaques (but multiplication) produced in BSC-1, L, human embryo kidney cells; CPE formed in monkey kidney 6619-1 cells (Smirnova et al. 1988). Natural foci: boskematic (pastoral xerothermic and semi- desert ecosystems). Human disease: acute illness with severe fever, headache, general weakness, retrobulbar pain, with encephalitis in c. 40 % of patients and a long, 2-month convalescence period. Five cases of severe laboratory infection (due to aerosol) have been described (Butenko et al. 1987). The virus could also be contagious from man to man. European distribution: Fig. 12. Seroprevalence rate among humans is relatively high in Astrakhan (4–9 %) but low in Portugal (0.8 %: Filipe et al. 1985). Outside Europe DHOV occurs in India, Egypt, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, and antibodies were detected in Pakistan. Family Asfarviridae Asfivirus of African swine fever (ASFV) The only DNA arbovirus occurring in Europe. There are several antigenic types, while no recognized prototype strain of ASFV. Hemadsorption-inhibiting antibodies are isolate specific, but HA is not produced. Interestingly, neutralizing antibodies do not appear in vertebrates. The virus is sensitive to dodecyl sulphate and heat (60°C) while less sensitive to putrefaction, formaldehyde and alkali. History: originally isolated by R.E. Montgomery from the blood of a sick pig in Kenya, 1910, and in Europe ASFV was first isolated in 1957 (Karabatsos 1985). Arthropod vectors are soft ticks Ornithodoros moubata porcinus (TST, TOT) in Africa, and O. erraticus in SW. Europe. Fig. 12 European distribution of Dhori (circles) and Thogoto (squares) viruses 28 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 Vertebrate hosts are S. scrofa (domestic and wild swine), in Africa also common warthog Phacochoerus africanus (main reservoir), bushpig Potamochoerus por- cus, giant forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni (Jori and Bastos 2009). The wild suids are the reservoir of ASFV with usually inapparent infection (except for S. scrofa). ASF is a pantropic, highly contagious disease of pigs with fever, cough, anorexia, skin cyanosis, in- coordination, diarrhea; destruction of lymphoreticular elements, vasculitis, widespread hemorrhages, thrombo- ses, infarction, and abortion (Schlafer and Mebus 1984). Lethality is 100 % with virulent strains in naive com- mercial pig populations, while some strains may pro- duce mild disease and carriership. Cattle, sheep, goat, dog and rabbit (s.c., i.v.) are insusceptible though the virus recovery has been sometimes reported in rabbit and goat. CPE is produced in primary porcine leuco- cyte, bone marrow and kidney cells. European epizootics of ASF occurred in Portugal (1957 and 1960: Filipe 1980), SW. Spain (since 1957: Oleaga-Perez et al. 1990), Sardinia, Malta, recently in the Caucasus region (since 2007) including southern Russia (North Ossetia, Krasnodar territory, 2008– 2011), and temporarily in France (1964), Italy (1967, 1983: Swaney et al . 1987), Belgium, and the Netherlands. Natural foci: mainly tropical and subtropical pastoral ecosystems. Principally a wild hog/pig-Ornithodoros cycle. Moreover, circulation in pig pens in rural habitats. Human disease has not been reported. European distribution: Fig. 13. Occasionally intro- duced into southern Europe, Belgium, and the Nether- lands. Outside Europe: many African countries; temporarily Brazil and some Caribbean islands (Cuba, Haiti). Conclusions Several “European” tiboviruses cause very serious human (CEEV, RSSEV, CCHFV) or animal (LIV, ASFV) diseases. Other arboviruses play definite role in human or animal pathology though the disease is usually either less serious or infrequently reported (TYUV, BHAV, AVAV, EYAV, TRBV, DHOV, THOV). In general, three groups of tibovi- rus diseases can be recognized according to main clinical symptoms produced: (i) febrile illness—usually with a rapid onset, fever, sweating, headache, nausea, weakness, myal- gia, arthralgia, sometimes polyarthritis and rash; (ii) the CNS affection—meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or en- cephalomyelitis with pareses, paralysis, and other sequelae; (iii) hemorrhagic disease. The other European arboviruses are “orphans” without a proven medical or veterinary sig- nificance (BAHV, MTRV, MEAV, GAV, PTVV, ZTV, SAHV, UUKV, SOLV, PIV, AVAV, CMV, OKHV, CWV, MYKV, TDMV, BAUV). However, certain arbovirus dis- eases of free-living vertebrates (but also those of domestic animals and even man) may often pass unnoticed or mis- diagnosed and eventually, they might potentially appear as emerging diseases. In addition, active search for new Fig. 13 European distribution of African swine fever virus Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 29 tiboviruses or for new, pathogenic variants of the known tiboviruses in Europe should continue.

Jaaskelainen-2006-Siberian subtype tickborne e.pdf	"Dispatches.qxp Siberian Subtype Tickborne Encephalitis Virus, Finland Anu E. Jääskeläinen,* Tapani Tikkakoski,† Nathalie Y. Uzcátegui,* Andrey N. Alekseev,‡ Antti Vaheri,*§ and Olli Vapalahti*§¶ We isolated 11 Siberian subtype tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) strains from Ixodes persulcatus ticks from a TBEV-endemic focus in the Kokkola Archipelago, western Finland. Thus I. persulcatus and the Siberian TBEV are reported in a focus considerably northwest of their previ- ously known range in eastern Europe and Siberia. Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease endemic in azone extending from central and eastern Europe to Siberia and Japan. Three subtypes of the causative agent tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are known: the European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (1,2). The main vec- tor for the European subtype is Ixodes ricinus, and for the other 2 subtypes, I. persulcatus (1,3–5). I. ricinus is found in Europe and Middle East (6), and I. persulcatus ranges from eastern Europe to China and Japan. The boundary between their distribution lies at the Russian side of the Finnish-Russian border (1,7). The distribution areas of both tick species overlap in eastern Europe (4,5) (Figure 1). I. persulcatus has not been reported from north- ern or western Europe except for an engorged nymph on a willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) in northeastern Sweden in May 1992 (6). In Finland, the TBE-endemic areas are mostly in the coastal regions: two thirds of cases come from the Åland Islands. Other TBE-endemic regions include the Archipelago of Turku, a focus in Isosaari (an island outside Helsinki), the Lappeenranta region in southeastern Finland, and the Archipelago of Kokkola in western Finland (9). The virus was found in the same areas (except for Isosaari) as early as the 1960s by screening antibodies to TBEV from cattle sera (10). The TBE focus in the Archipelago of Kokkola (63°50'N, 23°10'E), ≈300 km south of the Arctic Circle, has a peculiar location; it is an isolated focus, far from other TBE-endemic areas, and is the northernmost TBE- endemic area known. Furthermore, the recent TBE cases have been severe with sequelae (11,12). A cluster of cases in 2002 led us to study ticks in the Kokkola Archipelago for TBEV. The Study A total of 1,181 ticks were collected by flagging in the Archipelago of Kokkola in June 2004 (Table 1). In the tick-collecting areas 1–7, TBE patients had reported tick bites, and in areas 8–10, no TBE cases have been found. All the locations were islands or peninsulas within 20 km of each other. The ticks were homogenized in pools of ≈10 with Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin (D-PBS-BSA) and sand to 122 pools. RNA was isolated from 100 µL of the pools by TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Espoo, Finland). The RNA was dissolved in 20 µL diethyl pyrocarbonate–treated water, and 10 µL was used for nested reverse transcription (RT)–PCR, amplifying a 252-nt sequence from the TBEV- NS5 gene to detect TBEV-RNA according to Puchhammer-Stöckl et al. (13), except that the outer for- ward primer used was 5′-GGAGGCTGAACAACTG- CAC-3′. TBEV-RNA was detected in 13 pools (each consisted of 10 adult ticks) (Table 1).

To the south and west from the solid line, Ixodes ricinus distribution; to the east from the dashed line, I. persulcatus distribution; Lpr, Lappeenranta; EST, Estonia; LV, Latvia; LT, Lithuania. 1 tick in a positive pool was positive for TBEV RNA, the overall TBEV prevalence was 1.1%. To isolate TBEV strains from the RT-PCR–positive tick pools, 20 µL of the supernatant of the pools diluted 1:1 in D-PBS-BSA was injected intracerebrally into suckling NMRI mice. One litter of suckling mice was used for each pool. The mice were followed for 14 days or until symp- toms of illness appeared, and then they were killed. From 200 µL of the homogenized mouse brains, diluted 1:5 with D-PBS-BSA, RNA was extracted by TriPure, and RT-PCR for the partial TBEV-E gene was performed. The cDNA was produced with the reverse primer 5′-CCYCCAGC- CARGAGRAAGC-3′ by M-MuLV-RT enzyme (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and subsequent PCR was performed with this and a forward primer 5′- AACAGGGAYTTTGTCACTGGYACTC-3′ by Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas) (detailed RT-PCR protocol avail- able from the authors upon request). A region of 205 nt from the NS5 gene from the RT- PCR–positive tick pools and 1,225-nt stretch from the E gene from the brains of the infected suckling mice were sequenced (GenBank accession nos. in Table 2). Unex- pectedly, based on the partial NS5 sequences from the RT- PCR–positive tick pools (data not shown), the TBEV strains in Kokkola belonged to the Siberian subtype of TBEV. A phylogenetic tree based on the partial E gene sequences (1,076 nt) obtained from the TBEV isolates was prepared by the maximum likelihood method (Figure 2, scripts and datasets available from the authors upon request). Within the 1,076-nt stretch of the E gene, the Kokkola strains were >99.6% identical to each other. The closest relatives were Latvia-1-96 (97% identical) and the Estonian strains Est54, Est3535, and EK328 (95%–96%). Consequently, the Siberian subtype strains isolated from Finland and nearby Baltic states form a lineage together within the Siberian subtype. Other Siberian subtype strains Vasilchenko, Aina, Zausaev, and TBEV228 showed 92%–94% identity, and the European and Far Eastern sub- types showed 84%–86% identity. However, the vector tick species for Siberian-type TBEV, I. persulcatus, was not known to exist in Finland. This knowledge led us to study the tick species more carefully. DNA was isolated from 20 tick pools by TriPure and resuspended in 100 µL of TE (Tris-HCl 10 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, pH ≈8). The tick species was determined as I. persulcatus by amplifying an average of 339 bp from mitochondrial 16S RNA gene by PCR and subsequent sequencing according to Caporale et al. (14). Because the ticks were pooled and homogenized before species identification, 30 adult ticks from the same region collected later in the summer were examined micro- scopically. All these specimens were I. persulcatus by morphologic criteria. Conclusions A TBE focus has existed in the Kokkola Archipelago at least since the 1960s when TBEV antibodies were detect- ed in cattle (10), but the local TBE viruses have not been characterized. A cluster of severe human cases in the beginning of the 2000s prompted us to carry out the pres- ent study. In June 2004, we collected 1,181 ticks from the Archipelago of Kokkola and detected TBEV-RNA in 13 pools. Eleven were also positive in virus isolation. The sequences showed that the strains belonged to the Siberian subtype, whereas in the other Finnish TBE-endemic foci, only European subtype TBEV closely related to the central European strains has previously been detected (15). Furthermore, the tick species was I. persulcatus. Our results show that both I. persulcatus and the Siberian type TBEV are occurring several hundreds of kilometers further to northwest than what has been known previously. Because the 2 tick species are similar to the naked eye and in their behavior, and published data on distribution of Ixodes ticks in Finland are sparse and outdated, we cannot exclude the possibility that I. persulcatus also exists unno- ticed elsewhere in Finland. More tick surveys and epi- demiologic studies are needed to map the distribution areas of the 2 vector species and of the different TBEV subtypes in Finland. However, in our recent tick collections from Tickborne Encephalitis Virus, Finland Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 12, No. 10, October 2006 1569 Åland and southern (Isosaari, 60°N, 25°E) and eastern (Lappeenranta, 61°N, 28°E, and Joensuu, 62°N, 29°E) Finland, all ticks were I. ricinus. Some researchers have found indications that the Siberian TBEV might cause more severe or more persist- ent forms of TBE than the European subtype (4), and 3 of 5 recent human TBE cases in Kokkola have been severe (11,12). However, the number of cases studied from Kokkola is too small for firm conclusions on the severity of the local disease.

Kading,* Robert Kityo, Teddie Nakayiki, Jeremy Ledermann, Mary B. Crabtree, Julius Lutwama, and Barry R. Miller Arbovirus Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado; Department of Biological Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda; Department of Arbovirology, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda Abstract. Entebbe bat virus (ENTV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), closely related to yellow fever virus, was first isolated from a little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) in Uganda in 1957, but was not detected after that initial isolation. In 2011, we isolated ENTV from a little free-tailed bat captured from the attic of a house near where it had originally been found. Infectious virus was recovered from the spleen and lung, and the viral RNA was sequenced and compared with that of the original isolate. Across the polypeptide sequence, there were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in 97.8% identity at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates. Further study of this virus would provide valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and transmission of bat- and mosquito- borne flaviviruses. Bat virus investigations in Uganda were initially inspired in the mid-1950s by the isolations of rabies virus and a novel flavivirus, later to become known as Rio Bravo virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), from the salivary glands of insec- tivorous bats in the United States.1–3 Subsequently, investi- gators at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) collected bats from the attic of UVRI, dissected salivary glands, and isolated viruses by intracerebral inoculation of triturated salivary gland extracts into neonatal mice.4,5 This first effort resulted in the isolation of Entebbe bat salivary gland virus, strain IL-30 (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) from a little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) (Cretzchmar).4,5 The taxon was then recognized by one of its synonyms: Tadarida (Chaerephon) limbata (Peters). Lumsden and others4,5 determined that this isolate was a novel flavivirus through a series of neutralization tests using immune sera against 20 arboviruses as well as against Rio Bravo virus. By 1964, bat virus research had expanded at UVRI, and sampling of 1,022 additional bats yielded 14 strains of viruses including Dakar bat virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) also from little free-tailed bats, and Bukalasa bat virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) from Angolan free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus) (A. Smith).6 Isolation of Mount Elgon bat virus (Rhabdoviridae: Ledantevirus) followed shortly thereafter from an eloquent horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hildebrandtii eloquens) (K. Anderson) captured in Kenya, with the virus being isolated and charac- terized at UVRI.7,8 Additional bat virus discoveries in Uganda later included Kasokero virus (Bunyaviridae, unassigned) from an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (E. Geoffroy).9 Entebbe bat virus (ENTV, renamed), Bukalasa bat virus, and Dakar bat virus were all isolated from insectivorous bats captured in the attic of UVRI.10 Serological surveys suggested that the infection prevalence of ENTV in wild populations of little free-tailed bats was high, but ENTV was never isolated again after the original discovery.10,11 To follow up on these early studies, arbovirus surveil- lance of bats was conducted in Uganda from 2011 to 2013. Bats were captured from attics in several locations around Entebbe and Kampala as part of a larger, country-wide sam- pling effort to be reported elsewhere. All bat captures were conducted under the approval of CDC/DVBD IACUC pro- tocol 010-015. Bats were captured in attics using mist nets, taking appropriate biosafety precautions. On capture, bats were placed individually in cloth holding bags. Bats were anesthetized with halothane, exsanguinated by cardiac punc- ture, and euthanized by halothane overdose and cervical dis- location. Blood from bats was collected directly into serum separator tubes, centrifuged in the field, and placed immedi- ately in a nitrogen dry vapor shipper. Liver, spleen, heart, lung, and kidney were all collected directly into cryovials and stored immediately on dry ice. In total, 95 little free- tailed bats and 34 Angolan free-tailed bats were captured in 2011, 15 little free-tailed bats in 2012, and 70 little free-tailed bats in 2013. Virus isolation was attempted first from spleens, and on a positive result, virus isolation was also performed from the remaining tissues harvested from the infected bat. A single virus was isolated from 1 of 180 (0.5%) little free-tailed bats. The infected bat was an adult male, captured in Banga, Nakiwogo (0°04.884′ N, 32°27.030′ E) on June 23, 2011, near UVRI. Infectious virus was isolated from the spleen and lung; no infectious virus was recovered from the heart, liver, or kidney. No other tissues, oral or fecal swabs were col- lected from the insectivorous bats captured in 2011. The isolate was initially identified as ENTV by sequencing of the flavivirus NS5 amplicon using primers FU2/CFD3,12 fol- lowed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Virus isola- tions, nucleic acid preparations, and NGS were performed as described previously.13 Novel primers were designed from contigs generated from the NGS data using Primer 3 software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA)14 (Supplemental Table 1), and the sequence for the entire genome was confirmed by direct sequencing. End ter- minal sequences were obtained using 5′/3′ RACE (FirstChoice® RLM-RACE, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus-specific RACE primers are provided in Supplemental Table 1. The 5′ outer reaction used primer 514R in combination with the 5′ RACE outer primer. The 5′ RACE inner reactions used primer 388R together with the 5′ RACE inner primer; amplification was also achieved with primers 15F + 388R. The 3′ outer reaction used either primer 9882F or 10328F in combination with the 3′ RACE outer primer. The 3′ inner RACE was not successful. *Address correspondence to Rebekah C.

E-mail: rcmosquito@ gmail.com 475 A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA version 6.015 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) using 10,493 nucleotides spanning the open reading frame sequence of select flavivirus genomes available in GenBank (Figure 1). The analy- sis was performed using a complete deletion substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. In total, 10,663 nucleotides of the ENTV genome were obtained (GenBank Accession number KP233893), of which the polypeptide is encoded between nucleotides 120 and 10,355. Kuno and Chang16 published the only other existing ENTV genome (DQ837641) sequenced from the original IL-30 strain. Compared with that original sequence, we report an additional 153 nucleotides in the 3′ noncoding region, but also experienced difficulty in obtaining the complete 3′ ter- minal sequence.16 Across the polypeptide sequence, there were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in 97.8% identity at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates. Before sequencing, the 1957 isolate had been passaged in suckling mouse brain, but the earlier passage history is unclear; the 2011 isolate was passaged twice in Vero cells. This 2.2% amino acid divergence is within the range that has been observed for other flaviviruses with isolations ranging between 1 and 49 years apart,17–19 indicating relatively little change in the ENTV genome in 54 years since the first isolation. Every gene had at least one amino acid change except for PrM and M (Table 1). The highest percent divergence between the two isolates was in NS4A, 10.3% (Table 1). NS4A is a small, multifunctional, hydrophobic protein that plays a role in modulating the host’s type I interferon response.20 It has also been shown to associate with host cellular vimentin during dengue virus replication to stabilize the replication complex.21 The functional significance of this high percentage of amino acid divergence has yet to be determined, but Hahn and others22 surmised that a large number of amino acid sub- stitutions could be accommodated among the small, hydro- phobic polypeptides NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B so long as the hydrophobicity profile remained unchanged. In this case, changes to the NS4A hydrophobicity profile between these two isolates were inconsequential. Two of the 76 amino acid changes occurred at the junctions of NS2A/NS2B, and at NS4A/2K. The lengths of all of the genes were identical to those previously reported.16 The phylogenetic relationship between ENTV and yellow fever virus (YFV) is very interesting, as YFV is historically one of the most medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Although ENTV falls phylogenetically within the mosquito- borne flaviviruses and historically has been placed in the YFV group,16,23 it has only been isolated twice from bats (1957 and 2011) and never from wild-caught mosquitoes or humans. Figure 1 confirms the phylogenetic placement of FIGURE 1. Maximum likelihood tree based on open reading frame sequence (complete gap deletion).

ENTV also replicates in mosquito cells.26 Despite remaining an obscure bat-associated virus for over a half century, ENTV continues to circulate among little free-tailed bats in Uganda. Further study of this virus would provide valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and transmission of bat-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs. 1. Introduction Emerging infectious diseases threaten global biodiversity and public health [1–3]. Most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of humans are zoonoses. Most zoonoses originate in wildlife and are increasing over time [3–5]; however, the relative importance of different groups of wildlife hosts in the emergence of zoonoses remains unclear, as do the mechanisms driving such differences. http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2753&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2013-02-06 mailto:angela.d.luis@gmail.com http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2753 http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2753 http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org ProcR SocB 280:20122753 2 Bats (Order Chiroptera) provide considerable ecosystem services, such as arthropod suppression, seed dispersal and pollination, across a vast range of regions and habitats. How- ever, bats are receiving increasing attention as potential reservoirs for zoonotic diseases following recent identification of their involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome- like coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, as well as Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses [6]. Consequently, there has been repeated speculation that bats may be unique in their potential to harbour zoonotic viruses [6–8]. Traits that may make bats suited to hosting more viruses in general (zoo- notic and non-zoonotic) include relatively long lifespans for their body size [9], which may facilitate viral persistence for chronic infections; the reliance of some on prolonged torpor, which can decrease both viral replication and immune function [10,11]; and flight, allowing movement and dispersal over long distances in some species. Additionally, many bat species are gregarious, some living in dense aggregations: for example, some Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) colonies can reach densities of 3000 bats per square metre, in populations of up to a million individuals per roost [12,13]. Roosting sites can house diverse assemblages of multiple bat species [14,15]. High intra- and interspecific contact rates can facilitate rapid transmission of pathogens and large population sizes could sustain acute-immunizing infections. Additionally, there are some traits that may make bats more likely to host zoonotic viruses in particular and/or transmit them to humans. In evolutionary terms, bats are ancient mammals and it has been hypothesized that viruses which evolved in bats may use highly conserved cellular receptors, thus enhan- cing their ability to transmit viruses to other mammals [6]. Many species of bats have peridomestic habits, roosting in houses and other buildings, as well as trees in dense urban areas, leading to frequent human contact with bat excreta [16–18]. Bat–human contact is also increasing in recent dec- ades owing to habitat encroachment and increased use of bats as bushmeat [17–21]. However, despite the speculation that bats are unusual in their potential to host zoonotic viruses, there are no quantitative comparative analyses to support this hypothesis. Identifying reservoir species is key to controlling emerg- ing infectious diseases, but there is currently no framework for characterizing the likely role a potential host species may play. Therefore, a general approach is needed for under- standing how host–pathogen communities are broadly structured. A growing area of research in ecology relies on trait-based approaches to predict community assembly [22]. These approaches concentrate on traits of species in an attempt to find generalities in species interactions with each other and with the environment. Characterizing which traits are associated with pathogens and their reservoir hosts will contribute to understanding basic disease emer- gence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help to focus future research and disease mitigation efforts. In this study, we make a first attempt to quantitatively address the hypothesis that bats are unique hosts of zoonotic viruses, and further, apply a trait-based approach to identify life-history, physiological and ecological traits that correlate with a species’ propensity to host zoonotic viruses. Rodents (Order Rodentia) are a suitable comparison group as they are important reservoir hosts of a number of zoonotic viral pathogens with significant impacts on public health [23]. These pathogens include hantaviruses (causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome; [24]) and arenaviruses (causing, e.g. lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Lassa fever and Argentine, Bolivian, Vene- zuelan and Brazilian haemorrhagic fevers [25]). Rodents also share a number of characteristics with bats that have been hypothesized to affect reservoir potential; both taxonomic orders are evolutionarily ancient, diverse and include many species with peridomestic habits and species that com- monly express torpor. Rodents are more diverse than bats in numbers of species and life-history strategies (the repro- duction-longevity trade-off ), which enables a more general examination of host correlates for viral richness across taxo- nomic orders. We also investigate a series of factors that may be important in pathogen sharing, such as host related- ness, geographical overlap and conservation status (which may be important in pathogen sharing, e.g. as in primates [26,27]). Finally, we examine the possibility of increased zoo- notic viruses at low latitudes, as Jones et al. proposed a link between latitude and risk of zoonotic emergence [3]. In addition to host traits, viral traits affect spillover and emergence of zoonoses: RNA viruses are more likely to emerge than DNA viruses [28], and replication in the cyto- plasm was the best predictor of cross-species transmission from livestock to humans [29]. Therefore, we also explore some basic characteristics of viruses found in bats and rodents. 2. Material and methods (a) Viral data We compiled databases of viruses in bats or rodents and the species in which each has been detected by searching Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science (http://apps.webofknow ledge.com/) for each rodent and bat genus ‘AND virus’ (under ‘Topic’) through the year 2011. Viruses were grouped at the species level, based on the International Committee on the Tax- onomy of Viruses database. Host taxonomy conforms to Wilson & Reader’s Mammal Species of the World [30]. These data- bases are included in the electronic supplementary material. Viruses were classified as zoonotic or non-zoonotic; RNA or DNA; replicating in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and whether they consist of a single segment or multiple segments. Viruses and hosts that were not identified to species were not included in the analyses. More than double the number of viruses are known for Mus musculus than for any other rodent species, as a consequence of its use as a laboratory animal and the donor of many cell lines. For example, minute virus of mice was discov- ered as a contaminant in the experimental stock of a different virus when grown in a mouse cell line [31]. Therefore, this host species was removed from analyses, because preliminary analyses identified it as a high leverage point. (b) Species trait data For as many host species in our viral database as possible, we compiled data for the following traits (see the electronic sup- plementary material, table S14 and figures S4–S8): adult body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year, litter size, torpor use, migration (bats only), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conservation status, species geo- graphical distribution area, latitude of the midpoint (centroid) of the species distribution, number of other species in the same taxonomic order that are sympatric, number of citations on Web of Science. Data were obtained from an online database of mammalian traits (http://www.utheria.com) [32] on body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year and litter http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ http://www.utheria.com http://www.utheria.com Table 1.

Additional values were compiled from the literature (see the electronic supplementary material, table S14 for values and refer- ences) and the AnAge database (http://genomics.senescence. info/species/) [33]. Torpor expression was treated as a categori- cal variable with three categories: (i) no evidence of torpor use, (ii) some torpor use, but not true hibernation (minimum body temperature � 118C), and (iii) true hibernation (body temperature , 118C) [34]. Species sampling intensity was represented by the logged number of Web of Science citations for the binomial species name (and commonly used synonyms) in quotations. IUCN con- servation status, species distributions and longitude and latitude coordinates for the centroids of the distributions were obtained from the IUCN website (http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical- documents/spatial-data) [35]. The IUCN has seven conservation status categories: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct. The first three categories described all the bats in our analysis, and ‘least concern’ and ‘vulnerable’ described all the rodents in our analysis. Using the shape files from the IUCN website and the command ‘over’ from the R packages ‘sp’ and ‘rgeos’ [36,37], for each species in the analysis, we calculated how many other species in the same taxonomic order had species ranges that overlapped with its own, referred to here as sympatry. This included every species of bat or rodent for which IUCN had distribution shape files (1150 species of bat and 2216 of rodent). We follow Fleming & Eby [38, p. 157] in defining migration in bats as ‘a seasonal, usually two-way movement from one place or habitat to another to avoid unfavorable climatic con- ditions and/or to seek more favorable energetic conditions’. In most cases, these are regular annual movements that vary with predictable seasonal changes in temperature (for temperate zone bats) or rainfall (tropical bats). We did not consider records of one-way movements or dispersal as evidence for migration. We categorized migratory status of bats as: (i) species that can be broadly categorized as sedentary or only local (approx. less than 100 km) migrants, (ii) species that can be generalized as regional migrants (approx. 100–500 km), and (iii) species that can be categorized as long-distance migrants (greater than 500 km). This information was compiled from the literature, with species reported to be present in an area year-round considered evidence for category 1. (c) Analysis We used generalized least squares (GLS) to examine host trait correlates of zoonotic viral richness per host species, while con- trolling for phylogeny as described below. To examine whether bats host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses per host species than rodents, with and without taking into account sampling intensity, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) with negative binomial errors. Because many life-history traits are correlated, we performed principal components analyses (PCA) on the life-history traits: logged body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year and litter size. We performed three PCAs, one for bats (PCb), one for rodents (PCr) and one for the bats and rodents com- bined (PCrb). The variables were rescaled to have unit variance before analysis in R using the ‘prcomp’ function [36], and these principal components were then used in subsequent analyses. To determine if the number of zoonotic viruses or total number of viruses hosted by a species is significantly correlated to species traits, we performed GLS models for bats and rodents separately, then on the combined bat and rodent data. Because closely related species share traits, we tested for phylogenetic dependence using a GLS framework to allow for correlation structure in the error term. The ‘APE’ package [39] in R [36] was used to calculate a phylogenetic correlation matrix in which each entry was a pairwise correlation between each pair of species based on their shared branch lengths of a mammalian phylogenetic supertree [40]. The subsets of the phylogenetic tree that we used are shown in the electronic supplementary material, figures S2 and S3. The error term for the GLS was set to this cor- relation matrix multiplied by an additional parameter, Pagel’s l, that was estimated (using ‘optim’ in R) to determine the strength of phylogenetic dependence [41,42]. A l estimate of one indicates that the error structure of the model was directly proportional to the species shared branch lengths. A l estimate of zero indi- cates that the error structure of the model was not related to the species shared branch lengths (e.g. phylogeny does not explain any additional variation), and the correlation matrix is not included in the model. Models were ranked by their Akaike information criterion with a correction for finite sample sizes (AICc) values. Correlation coefficients (R) were obtained by using Pearson’s product moment correlation comparing the observed number of viruses to model predictions. Chi-squared (x2) tests were used to examine which viral traits, such as type of nucleic acid, genomic segmentation and site of replication were associated with zoonotic infection and taxonomic order. 3. Results Bats host, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents (tables 1 and 2). The response variable, zoonotic viral richness (i.e. number of zoonotic viruses per host species), was significantly greater for bats than rodents after controlling for the significant effect of sampling effort (i.e. order and number of citations were in the best model by AICc; table 1). However, as there are approximately twice as many species of rodent as species of bat, the overall number of zoonotic viruses was fewer in bats (61) than in rodents (68). Twenty-four viruses were present in both bats and rodents, of which 21 were zoonotic. Viruses (both zoono- tic and non-zoonotic) had a broader host range in bats, averaging 4.51 bat host species per virus, whereas rodent viruses averaged 2.76, which was significantly different by t-test (t ¼ 2.17, p ¼ 0.031; table 2). http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://genomics.senescence.info/species/ http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data Table 2.

This subset of bat and rodent species had 46 and 53 zoonotic viruses, respectively, which accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in both orders. (a) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection in rodents The first three principal components accounted for 93 per cent of the variance in rodent life-history strategies. PC1r separated r-selected species (larger litter size, more litters per year, shorter lifespan) from K-selected species (lower reproductive rates and greater mass and longevity; electronic supplementary material, figure S1a x-axis and table S1). PC2r separated reproductive strategies for a given number of offspring per year (litters per year versus litter size; electronic supplementary material, figure S1a y-axis and table S1). PC3r separated species with lower or higher values for all of the life-history traits (bigger, longer lived, higher reproduction; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Two models tied for the best model by AICc in GLS analyses examining correlates of zoonotic viral richness in rodents (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). Both models included the logged number of cita- tions and rodent sympatry, with one model containing IUCN conservation status. The number of citations was positively correlated with viral richness. Rodent sympatry was also positively correlated to zoonotic viral richness, i.e. rodent species whose distributions overlapped with a greater number of other rodent species had more zoonotic viruses. Rodents with an IUCN status of ‘vulnerable’ hosted fewer zoonotic viruses than those listed as ‘least concern’. Phylogeny did not explain additional variation: for every model, l , 1 � 10211. Figure 1a shows the ranking of variables by their DAICc values on removal or addition (compared with the best model). (b) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection in bats The first three principal components accounted for 88 per cent of the variance in bat life-history strategies. Negative values of PC1b indicated species with a greater litter size, and positive values indicated species with higher mass and longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup- plementary material, figure S1b x-axis and table S3). PC2b separated species with more litters per year from those with higher longevity (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S1b y-axis and table S3). PC3b separated species with larger litters and mass from those with higher longe- vity and litters per year (see the electronic supplementary material, table S3). The best model examining correlates of viral richness in bats by AICc included (in order of importance by DAICc) bat sympatry, the logged number of citations, and PC1b accounting for 78.7 per cent of the model weight (see the electronic supplementary material, table S4). The posi- tive coefficient of PC1b in the top ranked model indicated that bats with smaller litter size, larger body mass, greater longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup- plementary material, figure S1b, x-axis) are more likely to have more zoonotic viruses. Similar to our findings for rodents, sampling effort and sympatry were positively corre- lated to zoonotic viral richness. In models that did not include sympatry, phylogeny explained additional variation (l estimates ranged up to 0.29). For all the models that included sympatry, l , 0.001, indicating phylogeny did not explain additional variation once sympatry was taken into account. The importance of the different variables ranked by DAICc is shown in figure 1b. (c) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection across both bats and rodents PC1rb of the combined data largely separated bats from rodents and accounted for 51.1 per cent of the variance in life-history traits (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S9 and table S5). PC2rb, PC3rb and PC4rb largely described body mass, litters per year and longevity, and litter size and longevity, respectively (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S9 and table S5). All four PCs were used in the GLS models that controlled for phylogeny to account for relatively small differences in life-history traits. The best model for the combined data included, in order of importance, citations, taxonomic order, taxon sympatry, the interaction between order and sympatry and torpor use (table 3 and figure 1c). Again, bats hosted more zoonotic viruses per species and the effect of sympatry for bats was 3.9 times higher than for rodents. Torpor use was negatively correlated to zoonotic viral rich- ness (see the electronic supplementary material, table S7), and there was some weight for a negative effect of latitude (table 3). Phylogeny did not explain any additional variation (l, 0.01). (d) Species trait correlates of total viral infections The species trait correlates of total viral infections were similar to those for zoonotic infections. (see the electronic supplementary material, tables S8–S10.) The best rodent model included citations, rodent sympatry and torpor. The best bat model and the best model for the combined data were the same as for zoonotic viruses. +torpor +PC3r +PC1r +PC2r +latitude +area none −IUCN status −rodent sympatry −log(citations) (a) (b) (c) 0 10 15 20 25 +migration +IUCN status +torpor +PC3b +area +PC2b +latitude none -PC1b −log(citations) −bat sympatry −5 0 10 +IUCN status +PC1rb +PC3rb +PC2rb +area +PC4rb +latitude none −torpor −order : taxon sympatry −taxon sympatry −order −log(citations) 0 10 20 30 + DAIC 5 5 Figure 1.

The zoonotic viruses in our database were much more likely to be RNA viruses (x2 ¼ 42.7, p , 0.001), have multiple segments (x2=12.3, p , 0.001) and replicate in the cytoplasm (x2 ¼ 41.8, p , 0.001; electronic supplementary material, table S11), compared with non-zoonotic viruses. From the host perspective, bats harbored a higher proportion of unsegmented genome viruses compared with rodents (x2 ¼ 6.89, p ¼ 0.008; electronic supplementary material, table S12), but no significant differences were detected in replication site or nucleic acid, and no significant differences were present if comparing only zoonotic viruses of bats and rodents. 4. Discussion It has been suggested that bats may be unique in hosting many emerging zoonotic viruses [6,7]. We found that bats indeed host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses per species compared with rodents. Additionally, using a trait-based approach, we identified important life-history and ecological predictors of zoonotic viral richness for both bats and rodents, and identified viral traits that were strongly associated with zoonotic infection. Sympatry within taxonomic order appeared to be the most important host trait associated with zoonotic viral rich- ness, other than sampling effort as reflected in number of citations. In previous studies, sympatry was also found to be an important predictor of sharing of rabies virus variants among bats [43] and viruses among primates [26]. We show that the effect of sympatry was 3.9 times stronger for bats than for rodents. Although there are fewer range overlaps in bats, perhaps a consequence of there being approximately half the number of bat species as rodent species, there appears to be a greater impact on the number of zoonotic viruses per host when sympatry does occur, suggesting that viruses may be transmitted more easily between sympatric bat species than between sympatric rodent species. One poss- ible contributing factor is the level of interspecific contacts among bats when compared with rodents because many bat roosts have a diverse assemblage of bat species [14,15], whereas rodent species typically do not share communal nesting sites. However, high contact rates alone are rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org ProcR SocB 280:20122753 6 insufficient for cross-species transmission because host and/or virus traits also determine the ability of a virus to infect new host species. For example, the level of physiological similarity across sympatric bat species could affect the ability of viruses adapted to any of the sympatric species to spillover into others (which may be why phylogeny was also an important factor in viral sharing of rabies virus variants [43]). The general- ity of viral infection traits are probably also important and could allow non-specific viruses to take advantage of multiple host species in close contact. Here, we examined viral richness, but further examination of which viruses are shared among which hosts and their characteristics is warranted and may shed more light on this question. The importance of PC1b for bats indicated that bat species with smaller litter size, greater body mass, longevity and more litters per year, tended to host more zoonotic viruses. Rodents have a broad range of reproductive strategies, but in bats, litter size is negatively correlated with the number of litters per year (Pearson’s product moment correlation, p ¼ 0.024). No bat species consistently has more than three offspring per year, but at lower latitudes (less than 208), there is some variation as to how these offspring are distrib- uted throughout the year. Our analyses suggest that species which spread births over the year host more zoonotic viruses. A potential physiological explanation is the trade-off between immune function and reproduction. Sex hormones can modulate immunocompetence and affect disease resistance genes and behaviour that may make individuals more sus- ceptible to infection [44]. A potential ecological explanation is the replenishment of the susceptible pool from births. Immunizing, horizontally transmitted infections with a high R0 (basic reproductive number) are vulnerable to ‘burn-out’ after an epidemic when the number of susceptible hosts drops below the level needed to sustain an epidemic. More litters per year could mean a more continual replenishment of susceptible individuals. Increased zoonotic viral richness with host longevity is at odds with the ‘pace of life’ hypothesis, which proposes that short-lived animals put less energy into adaptive immunity in favour of more general immune responses (like broad bac- terial recognition), which may make them more competent reservoir hosts [45]. The competency of Lyme disease hosts, for example, seems to follow this pattern [46], but there appears to be mixed evidence for this more generally [47]. This hypothesis also does not consider pathogen traits. Viruses that cause chronic or persistent infections would have higher fitness in a longer-lived host because of the increased infectious period. Therefore, how the pace of a host’s life affects reservoir potential may be a function of traits of the virus, host and/or the virus–host interaction. We hypothesized that torpor use would be positively cor- related to viral richness since torpor expression was identified as a key factor in rabies perpetuation in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Colorado [48], and viral titers can peak upon arousal from hibernation [10]. However, we found torpor was negatively correlated to viral richness. One poten- tial explanation is reduced exposure to viruses owing to lower contact rates during torpor. More research is needed to determine the relationship between torpor, host compe- tence as related to within-host viral persistence and population viral perpetuation processes. For both bats and rodents, the number of citations was a positive indicator for viruses identified. It is commonly found that the number of pathogens recorded per species is positively correlated with sampling effort, even for well-studied species [26,49,50], indicating that the current estimates of viral richness are probably substantial underestimates. Hence, there may be many more viruses in both bats and rodents with the potential to spillover into humans. Although distribution area was not in the best models, this could be confounded by the finding that area was positively correlated to the number of citations (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S8)—widespread species are more often studied. Widespread species could also have more contact with humans, perhaps facilitating more frequent spillover of pathogens. We did not see a significant effect of phylogeny in most models (l was near zero). However, l indicates only the amount of residual variation that can be explained by phylo- geny after the variables are taken into account. Even though we found little effect of phylogeny in our overall models, when considered individually, all variables examined were correlated to phylogeny to some extent, in at least one of the two groups (see the electronic supplementary material, table S13), suggesting phylogenetic relationships are probably more important than indicated by the models. Overall, our analyses have explained approximately 43 per cent of the variation seen in zoonotic viral richness among hosts. Although we show that zoonotic viral richness of bats and rodents is significantly different, a majority of the variance in the number of zoonotic viruses per host species is still unexplained, leaving room for multiple alternative expla- nations. Although sympatry is a good predictor of zoonotic viral richness, our findings suggest high species diversity alone [6] is not the reason for bats hosting a high number of zoonotic viruses. Rodents, the mammalian order with the greatest number of species (twice the number of bat species), were found to host only seven more zoonotic viruses than bats, and rodents host fewer zoonotic viruses per species than bats. It has been hypothesized that because bats are evo- lutionarily ancient mammals, viruses that evolved with bats may use cellular receptors that have been conserved in mam- mals, enhancing the ability to transmit to other mammals, including humans [6,51]. However, rodents are evolutionarily older than bats and more closely related to humans [52–54]. If cell receptor evolutionary patterns follow whole genome evol- utionary patterns, cell receptors between humans and rodents should be more similar than between humans and bats. While it was beyond the scope of this paper to examine qualitative or quantitative differences in immunity between bats and rodents, such differences may play a role in viral establish- ment and perpetuation within host populations. We were also unable to address directly the hypothesis that flight helps disperse viruses [6]. However, we found that migration in bats did not predict a higher number of zoonotic viruses. One factor that we were not able to quantify but which is probably important for the ecology and evolution of viruses and other pathogens is the degree of sociality or coloniality of the host. Although many bat species are known to be colo- nial, a number of species are solitary or nearly so for at least part of the annual cycle. Moreover, the roosting behaviour and social structure of many other species is virtually unknown. Thus, we were not able to quantify coloniality reliably for the species in our analysis at this time, and we recommend future studies incorporate this variable. The viral traits we found to be associated with zoonotic infection were consistent with those identified by studies rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org ProcR SocB 280:20122753 7 of other taxa. Zoonotic viruses in bats and rodents were over- whelmingly RNA viruses that have multiple segments and replicate in the cytoplasm. These results are similar to those previously published for domestic livestock: for example, the ability to complete replication within the cytoplasm was the single best predictor of whether livestock viruses can infect humans, with a multiple-segmented genome also being a good predictor [29]. Other studies have shown that RNA viruses are more likely to cause emerging infectious diseases than DNA viruses, whether from livestock or from other mammals, such as carnivores [28]. These viral traits shed light on mechanisms of pathogen emergence and spillover. Viruses with RNA and/or multiple-segmented genomes may be more likely to generate genetic diversity with replication, through mutation and reassortment, increasing the chance of zoonotic viral emergence. Additionally, the ability to replicate in the cytoplasm may allow greater chance of spillover to new hosts (including humans) through bypassing the need to inter- act with the complex cell machinery (which is probably highly host-specific) needed to enter the nucleus for replication. As this study is based on a large literature search, there are necessarily constraints on inference, given different motiv- ations for, and methods used during studies of both rodent and bat viruses through time. However, our analysis of cita- tions and the interactions between order and citations suggest that the interaction only has 12 per cent weight (see electronic supplementary material, 4th model, table S6), thus suggesting that the effect of sampling effort was not substan- tially different between the two orders (with the exception of Mus musculus, removed from the analyses; see §2). Another potential source of bias may be reports of incidental or spil- lover hosts that are not important reservoirs but are treated with equal weight in these analyses. Furthermore, although we show that bats have more viruses per species, we cannot say with these analyses which species or orders are likely to be more important in spreading these viruses to humans. Dis- entangling these factors is difficult at present. Therefore, our results should be viewed with some caution. Recent advances in metagenomic and molecular studies may shed light on some of these issues and alter our understanding of human– rodent and human–bat cross-species transmission [55–57]. Since we did not examine other host groups that are important reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, e.g. primates, ungulates, carni- vores and birds, the importance of bats in comparison with other groups remains an open question. We chose rodents as a suitable first comparison because bats and rodents are more similar in life-history traits than other host groups. For example, non-human primates are indeed important reservoir hosts, however, their close phylogenetic relationship with humans, less overlap of life-history traits with bats, and the multiple examples of humans transmitting viruses to primates, such as measles and mumps [58,59] add additional confound- ing variables. However, further comparative analyses examining a broader range of host groups are warranted. This study provides evidence that bats are indeed special in at least one regard—they host more zoonotic viruses and more total viruses per species than rodents. However, because there is approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species, the overall number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats was lower than in rodents. Therefore, rodents should remain a serious concern as reservoirs for future zoonotic disease emergence. This study additionally identifies several specific traits that appear to promote viral richness across taxonomic orders. Given the importance of sympatry in our analysis, future analyses should aim to determine the relative effects of phylogeny and sympatry more broadly in animal reservoirs of emerging zoonoses. Fur- thermore, our analyses support the theory that traits of zoonotic viruses are also important in determining prob- ability of spillover. Both sympatry and viral traits may act together, with the ability to replicate in the cytoplasm and bypass additional host-specific cell machinery potentially allowing viruses to more easily pass between sympatric species in the same taxonomic order, which could be com- pounded by increased rates of interspecific contact. Our results, therefore, point to this as a newly hypothesized mechanism to explain, at least in part, how bats host more zoonotic viruses per species. Interspecific transmission may be more prevalent in bats than in rodents (or other orders). This is supported by the most recent molecular studies that indicate there has been a greater number of host switches of paramyxoviruses from bats to other mammals than from rodents, birds, primates, carnivores and cetartiodactyls [55]. Interspecific transmission and spillover is one of the least studied aspects of disease ecology and should therefore be a focus of further studies. Mechanisms of transmission of viruses among bat species may be different than transmission from bats to humans. The mechanisms of interspecific trans- fer of pathogens, particularly to humans, remain poorly understood, but in some cases are complex and involve inter- mediate hosts. Gaining understanding of actual mechanisms of such pathogen transfer should be an active area of research in order to develop evidence-based policies to minimize risks, while conserving bats and the irreplaceable ecosystem services they provide.

Serum was collected from each bat and assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using six flavivirus- es: West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and dengue viruses 1–4. Flavivirus-specific antibodies were detected in 26 bats (19%). The antibody-positive bats belonged to three species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (Glosso- phaga soricina), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and great fruit-eating bat (Arti- beus lituratus), and their flavivirus antibody prevalences were 33%, 24%, and 9%, respec- tively. The PRNT titers were usually highest for dengue virus 2 or dengue virus 4, but none of the titers exceeded 80. These data could indicate that most of the antibody-positive bats had been infected with dengue virus. However, because all titers were low, it is possible that the bats had been infected with another (perhaps unrecognized) flavivirus not included in the PRNT analysis, possibly a virus more closely related to dengue virus than to other flavivirus- es. Each serum sample was assayed for flavivirus RNA by reverse transcription PCR, but all were negative. Key words: Bats, Chiroptera, dengue vi- rus, flavivirus, Mexico, surveillance. Bats are one of the most abundant and geographically widespread groups of ver- tebrates. There are 1,116 recognized species of bats and they inhabit every continent (except Antarctica) and almost every ecosystem (Wilson and Reeder, 2005; Calisher et al., 2006). Bats are often found in areas inhabited by humans and harbor a diverse range of viruses of medical importance, including filoviruses, SARS-like and other coronaviruses, heni- paviruses, and lyssaviruses. Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) are recognized human pathogens in the genus Flavivirus, family Flavivir- idae. The role of bats in the transmission and ecology of DENV, WNV, and SLEV is not well understood, but several studies have demonstrated that bats of some species are susceptible to infection by these viruses (Sulkin et al., 1966; Paul et al., 1970; de Thoisy et al., 2009). Dengue virus exists as four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), and all are present in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (Lorono- Pino et al., 2004). Serologic data indicate that WNV and SLEV also occur in this region (Farfan-Ale et al., 2006). Never- theless, there is no information on the infection or prevalence of antibody to these viruses or any other flaviviruses in bats in the Yucatan Peninsula. Dengue virus–specific nucleic acid and antibodies were detected in bats in the nearby states of Veracruz, and DENV-specific antibod- ies were detected in bats in the states of Colima and Jalisco in southwest Mexico (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). No other investigators have examined whether fla- viviruses infect bats in Mexico. Our goal was to determine the occurrence of selected flaviviruses in bats in Merida, the largest city in the Yucatan Peninsula. We collected whole blood from 140 free-ranging bats captured using mist nets at five study sites, July–October 2010. One site was within the central business district (CBD); the other four were directly to the north, south, east, or west of the CBD. The site within the CBD was in the 684 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis Parque Zoologico El Centenario (Merida zoo; 20u5897.60N, 89u38926.00W). The northern site (Santa Gertrudis Copo; 21u02934.90N, 89u35930.10W) was on a private property containing a sheep pen, an enclosure of chickens, low scrub, and sparse trees. The southern site (Parque Metropolitano; 20u53950.80N, 89u39931.10W) was established in a public park with abundant trees and other vegetation and three small caves. The eastern site (Acua- parque; 20u56950.80N, 89u34940.40W) was in a public park containing a manmade lake, recreational facilities, low scrub, and native grasses. The western site (Parque Hundido; 20u58936.80N, 89u39928.50W) was a public park with numerous trees, native grasses, and several ponds. We trapped four nights a week (one site per night) using three mist nets (632 m with 16-mm mesh openings) at each site. Nets were placed over water, along fruiting trees, and at the entrances of caves whenever possible. Nets were set from dusk (,7:00 PM) until 11:00 PM. Captured bats were placed in cloth bags until processed. Bats were identified to species, age class (juvenile or adult), and sex (Medellı́n et al., 1997). Taxonomy followed Wilson and Reeder (2005). Ap- proximately 100 mL of blood was collected from each bat by nonlethal cardiac punc- ture or from the ulnar vein. Blood samples were diluted 10-fold using phosphate- buffered saline containing 0.75% bovine albumin fraction V, 500 units/mL penicil- lin, 500 mg/mL streptomycin, and 12.5 mg/ mL amphotericin, and placed on ice. Samples were transported to the labora- tory, centrifuged, and stored at 270 C. Sera were assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) following stan- dard methods (Beaty et al., 1995). The PRNTs were done using WNV (strain NY99-35261-11), SLEV (strain TBH-28), DENV-1 (strain Hawaii), DENV-2 (strain New Guinea C), DENV-3 (strain H-87), and DENV-4 (strain H-241). The PRNTs were performed in six-well plates contain- ing confluent monolayers of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera were initially tested at a dilution of 1:20, and those that reduced the number of plaques by $70% were titrated. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilutions yielding $90% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT90). Mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluids containing antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and DENV1– 4 were used as positive controls and sera from uninfected mice served as negative controls. Sera were also assayed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for flavivirus RNA. Briefly, 100 mL of each serum sample was added to 0.9 mL of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and total RNA was extracted in accor- dance with the manufacturer’s instruc- tions. Complementary DNAs were gener- ated using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Thermo Fisher Scien- tific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The PCRs were performed using Taq poly- merase (Invitrogen) and flavivirus-specific primers that target an ,800-nucleotide region of NS5 gene (Maher-Sturgess et al., 2008). The RT-PCR products were exam- ined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. We captured 140 bats belonging to two families, five subfamilies, and seven species (Table 1). The most highly represented species were the Jamaican fruit bat (Arti- beus jamaicensis) and great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus), which comprised 56% and 23% of captures, respectively. Eighty- nine (64%) bats were adults and 51 (36%) were juveniles. Fifty-nine bats were trapped in Parque Hundido, 42 in Parque Metropolitano, 21 in Acuaparque, 14 in the Merida zoo, and four in Santa Gertrudis Copo. All bats were nonmigratory and appeared healthy. Twenty-six bats (19%) had evidence of flavivirus infection (Tables 1 and 2). The bats with antibodies belonged to three species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina), Jamaican fruit SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 685 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis bat, and great fruit-eating bat. The species with the highest flavivirus antibody prev- alence was the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (33%). Antibody prevalences for the Jamaican fruit bat and great fruit-eating bat were 24% and 9%, respectively. Fifteen (58%) of the bats with flavivirus- specific antibodies were adults; 11 (42%) were juveniles. The PRNT90 titers were usually highest for DENV-2 or DENV-4, although all of the titers could be considered low because none exceeded 80 (Table 2). Low anti- body titers were also observed in bats from Costa Rica and Ecuador; these bats were assayed by PRNT using all serotypes of DENV and none had titers (when ex- pressed as PRNT80) above 80 (Platt et al., 2000). Likewise, low antibody titers were detected in bats from China that were assayed by microseroneutralization test using Japanese encephalitis virus (Cui et al., 2008). Our PRNT data could indicate that most of the flavivirus-antibody–positive bats had been exposed to DENV but high levels of neutralizing antibodies were not generated because DENV replicates inef- ficiently in chiropterans. Another potential explanation is that efficient DENV repli- cation does occur in bats but the titers were low because bats do not produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in response to DENV infection. In this regard, neutralizing antibodies to WNV were not detected in any bats following WNV inoculation, even though some were viremic (Davis et al., 2005). Experimental infection studies should be performed to assess the viremia profiles and antibody responses in bats after DENV inoculation. Flavivirus-specific neutralizing antibodies have been shown to persist at low titers in some vertebrate species long after the initial exposure (Gibbs et al., 2005), and therefore another explanation is that some of the infections were not recent. How- ever, this is probably not a major reason because 42% of the flavivirus-antibody– positive bats were juveniles. A more likely reason is that the majority (if not all) of the antibody-positive bats were infected with another, perhaps unrecognized, flavivirus not included in the PRNTs and that the low titers are due to serologic cross- reactivity. Flaviviruses have a close anti- genic relationship and therefore neutraliz- ing antibodies to one flavivirus often cross- react with heterologous flaviviruses (Cal- isher et al., 1989). Other flaviviruses known to infect bats include Rio Bravo virus (RBV) and Tamana bat virus (Allen et al., 1970; Price, 1978). Additional flaviviruses were not included in the PRNTs because many of the bats were small and the volume of sera available was limited. As stated earlier, 19% of bats had flavivirus-neutralizing antibody. Similar flavivirus antibody prevalences have been reported for bats elsewhere in Latin TABLE 1.

In a serosurvey performed in Guatemala, 19% of bats had antibodies that neutralized RBV (Ubico and McLean, 1995). Evidence of flavivirus infection was detected in 23% of bats in Costa Rica that were assayed by PRNT using all DENV serotypes (Platt et al., 2000). Higher antibody prevalence (30%) was observed in bats in Ecuador. However, in the studies described above, titers were ex- pressed as PRNT80, and therefore the reported antibody prevalences would have presumably been slightly lower if the more stringent PRNT90 had been used. In another study, 12% of bats in Colima, Jalisco, and Veracruz, Mexico, had anti- bodies that reacted with DENV antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). We did not detect flavivirus RNA by RT- PCR in any of the sera. Evidence of flavivirus infection has been demonstrated in bats assayed by RT-PCR in other studies (Zhang et al., 1998; Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008; de Thoisy et al., 2009). For example, DENV-2 RNA was detected in heart tissues from three species of bats in Veracruz (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). A notable difference between our study and the others cited here is that our RT-PCRs were performed using sera rather than tissues. Approval to perform terminal bleeds and harvest was not granted for our study. We have provided serologic evidence that flaviviruses infect bats of some species in the Yucatan Peninsula. Our PRNT titers were often highest for DENV, but, because all of the titers were low, many (if not all) of these bats could have been infected with a flavivirus not included in the PRNTs. Experimental infection stud- ies are needed to assess the potential of bats to serve as amplifying hosts of DENV. These experiments would also provide valuable information on the viremia pro- files and antibody responses in bats after DENV inoculation. Such data would facilitate the interpretation of PRNT data obtained in flavivirus serosurveys among free-ranging bats. We thank Virginia Ramirez-Sosa for assisting with trapping.

Mackenzie-2009-The zoonotic flaviviruses of so.pdf	The Zoonotic Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern and Eastern Asia, and Australasia: The Potential for Emergent Viruses ORIGINAL ARTICLE The Zoonotic Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern and Eastern Asia, and Australasia: The Potential for Emergent Viruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Division of Health Sciences, Curtin University of Technology, Perth Impacts • Flaviviruses of southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia comprise at least 30 viruses, ranging from major pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), and the four dengue viruses, to other viruses which either cause minor human febrile diseases or have not been associated with human disease. • Flaviviruses have been shown to have a propensity to spread, emerge and establish in new geographic areas, and thus any member may have the potential to emerge unexpectedly anywhere if suitable vectors and vertebrate hosts occur. • Most members of the genus have little or no known association with human or animal diseases, but they may all have an inherent potential to be more pathogenic in the future – indeed, with flaviviruses, one should expect the unexpected, they are unpredictable with respect to disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, and unexpected methods of transmission. • Phylogenetic studies suggest JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses may have derived from an ancestral African flavivirus and evolved in the Indo-Malay area to subsequently disperse throughout their geographic ranges, whereas WN virus probably evolved in Africa, and different genetic lineages spread to Australasia (lineage 1b), India (lineages 1a and 5), Malaysia (a newly identified lineage 6). In addition, a separate lineage evolved in Africa to become the closely related Koutango virus (lineage 7). • Novel flaviviruses have emerged in the region, including New Mapoon virus in northern Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus from Thailand, which demonstrates that new flaviviruses might be found in different ecosystems.

These include major pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), tick-borne encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, and the dengue viruses. Other members are known to be associ- ated with mild febrile disease in humans, or with no known disease. In addi- tion, novel flaviviruses continue to be discovered, as demonstrated recently by New Mapoon virus in Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus in Thailand. About 19 of these viruses are mosquito-borne, six are tick-borne, and four have no known vector and represent isolates from rodents or bats. Zoonoses and Public Health ª 2009 The Authors 338 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 Introduction The family Flaviviridae comprises three genera; the Flavi- virus genus, the Pestivirus genus, and the Hepacivirus genus. The viruses are 40–60 nm in diameter, spherical in shape, and contain a lipid envelope. All members of the family have a genome composed of a single molecule of linear positive-sense RNA, ranging in size from about 9.6 kb for Hepaciviruses, to 11 kb for Flaviviruses, and 12.3 kb for Pestiviruses. Members of each genus are sero- logically related to each other, but not to members of the other genera (Thiel et al., 2005). The Pestiviruses infect pigs and ruminants, but are not zoonotic. The major members of the genus include Bovine diarrhoeal disease virus and Classical swine fever virus. Hepaciviruses com- prise the hepatitis C viruses and only infect humans. Thus, these two genera will not be discussed further. The Flavivirus Genus The Flavivirus genus comprises over 70 members (Thiel et al., 2005). The type species is yellow fever virus from which the genus (and family) name is derived (flavus, Latin for ‘yellow’). Members of the genus Flaviviruses are found widely dispersed throughout the world on all con- tinents except Antarctica. Most are transmitted by an arthropod vector, either mosquitoes or ticks, but a few viruses have no known vector species. The most impor- tant mosquito-borne viruses are yellow fever virus, which is found in west, central and east Africa and tropical South America; Japanese encephalitis (JE) which is found in east, south-east and southern Asia, and in northern Australasia (Mackenzie et al., 2007); West Nile (WN) virus which is found in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, southern Asia, Australasia, and most recently, in North America and now spreading into Central and South America (Kramer et al., 2007; Blitvich, 2008); and dengue viruses which are found throughout much of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In addition, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and St Louis encephalitis (SLE) are the major encephalitic viruses in their respective geo- graphic regions, Australasia and the Americas respectively. The most important tick-borne virus is Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus which is found in central Europe and across the central and northern Asian continent. Others are important regionally, such as Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus in India. There are approximately 39 mosquito-borne members of the genus, 15 tick-borne members, and 17 with no known vector. The major crite- ria for determining the groupings of species and members within the genus are nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data, antigenic relationships, vector association and geographic incidence (Calisher and Gould, 2003; Thiel et al., 2005). The mosquito-borne viruses have been grouped into seven groups: the Aroa virus group with four members, the JE virus group with 10 members, the Ntaya virus group with six members, the Kokobera virus group with two members, the Dengue virus group with five members, the Spondweni virus group with two members, and the Yellow fever virus group with 10 members (Thiel et al., 2005). Some members are defined as subspecies (e.g. Kunjin virus as a subspecies of WN virus, and Alfuy virus as a subspecies of MVE virus), however, the interpreta- tion of the criteria for assigning a species level, and the definition of what constitutes a subspecies may be contro- versial. Thus, Kunjin virus is clearly a WN virus and a member of WN lineage 1, although forming a distinct clade, lineage 1b (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002), and Alfuy virus has recently been fully sequenced and is also clearly a separate species (May et al., 2006). The tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprise 12 spe- cies divided into two groups, the mammalian and seabird groups, with two of the mammalian species comprising an additional seven subtypes (Thiel et al., 2005). In the mammalian tick-borne group, six species are capable of Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggest that JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses probably emerged in the Malaya-Indonesian region from an African progenitor virus, possibly a virus related to Usutu virus. WN virus, however, is believed to have emerged in Africa, and then dispersed through avian migration. Evidence suggests that there are at least seven genetic lineages of WN virus, of which lineage 1b spread to Australasia as Kunjin virus, lineages 1a and 5 spread to India, and lineage 6 spread to Malaysia. Indeed, flaviviruses have a propensity to spread and emerge in new geographic areas, and they represent a potential source for new disease emergence. Many of the factors associated with disease emergence are present in the region, such as changes in land use and deforesta- tion, increasing population movement, urbanization, and increasing trade. Fur- thermore, because of their ecology and dependence on climate, there is a strong likelihood that global warming may significantly increase the potential for disease emergence and/or spread. J. S.

Of these, KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever viruses cause haemorrhagic fever in humans, while the remaining spe- cies are encephalitogenic. Gadget’s Gully (GGY) virus and Royal Farm virus make up the remaining species of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. The seabird tick- borne virus group contains the species Meaban, Saumerez Reef (SRE), Tyuleniy and Kadam viruses. However, a recent expanded phylogenetic analysis of these viruses identified Kadam virus as a distinct third group within the tick-borne flaviviruses (Grard et al., 2007). Transmis- sion of tick-borne viruses to mammalian or avian hosts occurs through the bite of infected ticks; virus can be transmitted by infected larvae, nymphs or adult ticks. TBE virus infections of humans can also occur via untreated milk of goats, sheep and cows (Kohl et al., 1996). A major factor in virus transmission between ticks is transfer from infected to uninfected ticks during co-feeding (Jones et al., 1987). Virus is also maintained by transovarial and transstadial transmission (Danielová and Holubová, 1991; Nuttall and Labuda, 2003). Once a tick is infected, it carries the virus for the duration of its lifetime. There are no major human or animal pathogens amongst the flaviviruses with no known vector. These viruses have been isolated from bats or rodents (Varelas- Wesley and Calisher, 1982). Two additional viruses are listed as tentative species in the genus; Tamana bat virus and Cell fusing agent virus. The latter, a virus associated with Aedes mosquitoes, has often been used as an out-group in phylogenetic studies, but recent data on Tamana bat virus suggest that it may be more distant (de Lamballerie et al., 2002), and thus a more appropriate choice as an outgroup for phylogenetic analy- ses. In addition, a novel insect flavivirus, Culex flavivirus (CxFV), has recently been reported from Japan which was found to be widespread in Culex pipiens and other Culex mosquitoes (Hoshino et al., 2007). It was able to replicate in cultured mosquito cells but not mammalian cells. Genetic sequencing revealed that CxFV is closely related to Cell fusing agent virus and Kamiti River virus, the other two members of the genus associated with mosquitoes. Perhaps the more useful indication of relationships between flaviviruses can be obtained from phylogenetic studies which tend to agree with antigenic and vector/ host relationships (e.g. Kuno et al., 1998; Poidinger et al., 1996; de Zanotto et al., 1996; Mackenzie et al., 2002a). A phylogenetic tree of the major members of the genus is shown in Fig. 1. Flaviviruses have shown a significant propensity to emerge and establish in new geographic areas. This was first observed some 400 years ago when yellow fever virus spread from West Africa to the New World through the slave trade, but more recently has been seen with a num- ber of other members of the family. Thus WN virus jumped from the Middle East to North America in 1999 (Jia et al., 1999; Lanciotti et al., 1999); Usutu virus spread from Africa to emerge in Austria as a disease of black- birds (Weissenböck et al., 2002); and JE virus has spread from south-east Asia into Australasia, first into Papua New Guinea (Johansen et al., 2000) and then into the Torres Strait of Northern Australia (Hanna et al., 1996). Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern, and Eastern Asia and Australasia There are at least 30 flaviviruses found in Southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia which have been recognized and classified into 11 of the 12 recog- nized groups; 19 of the viruses are transmitted principally by mosquitoes, seven by ticks, and four have no known vector (Mackenzie, 2000). These viruses and their serolog- ical group are shown in Table 1, and the phylogenetic relationships of the Asian and Australasian viruses com- pared with other members of the genus are shown in Fig. 1, with the Asian and Australasian viruses depicted within boxes. In addition, a map showing the location of their initial isolation or detection is shown in Fig. 2. They include some major pathogens, such as JE, WN, MVE and the dengue viruses, whereas some of the other mem- bers have not been associated with disease in humans or animals. With the exception of the dengue viruses, all of the flaviviruses have an animal reservoir, and thus either are, or have the potential to be, zoonotic. While the den- gue viruses may also be epizootic in their sylvan habitats in south-east and southern Asia, or West Africa, with non-human primates as their vertebrate hosts leading to occasional human infections (Rudnick, 1965; De Silva et al., 1999; Wolfe et al., 2001), dengue is now primarily an urban and peri-urban disease with humans as the Fig. 1.

Because the incidence of zoonotic transmission of dengue is probably relatively infrequent in most of the region, the dengue viruses will not be further discussed in this presentation. Mosquito-borne Flaviviruses The most important mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviruses in South-East Asia and the Western pacific are members of the JE serological group (Mackenzie et al., 2002a), and especially JE, MVE, and WN (including Kunjin viruses) viruses. The importance of the other mosquito-borne flaviviruses found in Asia and Australasia as causes of human or animal disease are less well defined, although at least one, Wesselsbron virus, is a major animal and human pathogen in Africa. Details of the viruses are sum- marized in Table 1, with the year and region of isolation, the major vector species and vertebrate hosts, and associa- tion with disease shown for each virus species. JE virus JE virus is the major mosquito-borne encephalitic flavivi- rus in Asia (Table 1). It is believed to be responsible for more than 40 000 cases of encephalitis annually, with at least 10 000 deaths, although these figures are generally regarded as a significant underestimate, and the true dis- ease burden might be closer to 175 000 cases annually (Tsai, 2000). With the near eradication of poliomyelitis, JE virus is now the leading cause of childhood viral neu- rological infection and disability in Asia (Halstead and Jacobson, 2003). Its geographic range extends from Japan, Korea and Maritime Siberia in the north, through China to the Philippines in the east, and through south-eastern Table 1.

The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 342 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 and southern Asia to Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka (Umenai et al., 1985; Burke and Leake, 1988; Vaughn and Hoke, 1992; Endy and Nisalak, 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2007). In recent years, JE has spread westwards into Pakistan in 1994 (Igarashi et al., 1994), into Kerala State in southwestern India in 1996 (Dhanda et al., 1997), and eastwards into the Australasian region in 1995 and 1998 (Hanna et al., 1996, 1999; Ritchie et al., 1997; Johansen et al., 2000; Mackenzie et al., 2002b). Until the 1995 JE virus outbreak in the Torres Strait of northern Australia, and without good scientific reasons, the south-eastern limit of JE virus was believed to be restricted to the north and west of the Wallace Line, an imaginary line running between Bali and Lombok and separating the Oriental and Australasian zoogeographic regions, whereas MVE virus was believed to be restricted to the south and east of the line (Marshall, 1988; Mackenzie et al., 2002b). Much of the spread in Asia is believed to be due to defor- estation for increased agriculture, and changes in land use with the large increase in rice fields and irrigated agricul- ture. JE is a zoonotic disease; the major vertebrate hosts for JE virus are pigs and ardeid birds, with pigs playing a central role in virus amplification. Indeed, pigs are often the drivers of epidemic activity, although epidemics can sometimes occur in their absence (Soman et al., 1977). The disease in pigs is relatively minor; transplacental transmission of JE virus is well established, leading to foe- tal encephalitis, abortion and stillbirth, and it also causes hypospermia and aspermia in boars (e.g. Takashima et al., 1988; Daniels et al., 2002). Ardeid birds are the mainte- nance hosts of JE virus, particularly Black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), Little egrets (Egretta garz- etta), and Plumed egrets (E. intermedia), but the virus does not cause disease in birds. Pigs can also act as main- tenance hosts in endemic areas. JE virus also causes encephalitis in horses, but as with humans, horses are ‘dead-end’ hosts and not involved in onward transmission (Ellis et al., 2000). Orangutans have also been implicated as possible vertebrate hosts in sylvatic cycles of JE trans- mission in Borneo (Wolfe et al., 2001). A number of mosquito species have been shown to be competent for transmitting JE, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus, Cx. vishnui, and Cx. annulirostris being the most impor- tant species in various geographic locations. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that at least four distinct genotypes of JE virus are circulating in Asia and northern Australasia (Fig. 3) (Chen et al., 1990, 1992; Ali and Igarashi, 1997), and there is limited evidence of a fifth genetic lineage isolated in Singapore (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2001). Only one of these genotypes (G3) has been found in all regions encompassing the geo- graphic range of JE virus, while G1 and G2 have been found in eastern and south-eastern Asia and northern Australasia. The circulation of the fourth genotype appears to have been restricted to Indonesia (Solomon et al., 2003). Fig. 2.

Williams The Zoonotic Flaviviruses ª 2009 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 343 MVE and Alfuy viruses MVE and Alfuy viruses are Australasian members of the JE serological complex (Mackenzie et al., 1994). MVE virus is the cause of Australian encephalitis and is the most important Australasian member of the complex. It is found in mainland Australia, New Guinea, and proba- bly in the eastern Indonesian archipelago (Mackenzie et al., 1994; Spencer et al., 2001). It is endemic in north- ern Australia, especially in the Kimberley region of Wes- tern Australia and the north of the Northern Territory, and possibly endemic in parts of northern Queensland. It is epidemic in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and very occasionally it spreads into south-eastern Aus- tralia where it causes major epidemics and from where the virus obtained its name. The two most recent epidem- ics in south-eastern Australia were in 1951 and 1974, but the virus also occurred in south-eastern Australia in 1956, and most recently, in 2008 although at the time of writ- ing, no clinical cases have been reported. Since 1978, about 90% of human cases have occurred in the north- west of Australia, particularly the Kimberley and Pilbara regions, and in the Northern Territory, possibly due to the damming of the Ord River and the establishment of large areas of irrigated agriculture (Mackenzie and Broom, 1998). Indeed, the virus has been gradually moving further south in Western Australia, and is now within about 400 km of Perth in the south-west corner of the State (Broom et al., 2002). The major mosquito vec- tor of MVE virus is Cx. annulirostris, although the virus has been isolated from a number of other mosquito species (Russell, 1995), some of which undoubtedly are involved in transmission cycles. The major vertebrate hosts are believed to be ardeid birds, of which the most important is the Nankeen night heron (N. caledonicus). Limited sequence and antigenic analyses using mono- clonal antibodies have suggested that at least four genetic lineages of MVE virus occur in Australasia (Fig. 3), two of which are found on the Australian mainland, lineages 1 and 2, and two in Papua New Guinea, lineages 3 and Fig. 3.

The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 344 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 4 (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988; Poidinger et al., 1996; Johansen et al., 2007). Alfuy virus has not been associated with human disease (Mackenzie et al., 1994), and is generally less neuroinva- sive in murine experiments (May et al., 2006). Alfuy virus is also believed to utilize ardeid birds as its major reser- voir host, and Cx. annulirostris as its major vector species. Recent antigenic, genetic and virulence studies have shown that it is closely related to MVE virus (Fig. 3), but is genetically, antigenically and phenotypically distinct (May et al., 2006). Indeed, these differences have led to the proposal that Alfuy virus be re-classified as a distinct virus within the JE virus group (May et al., 2006). WN virus WN virus is found in southern Asia, especially in India (Banerjee, 1996; Bondre et al., 2007; Mackenzie et al., 2007), and sporadically in South-East Asia, two examples being from Cambodia and Sarawak (Karabatsos, 1985; H.S. Hurlbut, unpublished data, cited by Simpson et al., 1970). Cases of WN encephalitis and febrile disease have been reported sporadically in India (Banerjee, 1996; Thak- are et al., 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2007), which is a very different pattern to the epidemic activity displayed by JE virus. In Australasia, WN is found as Kunjin virus (Scherret et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2002), a genetically distinct sub- lineage of WN virus lineage 1. Kunjin virus can also cause encephalitis, Kunjin encephalitis, but the disease is gener- ally milder than that caused by MVE virus. It can also cause a febrile illness, sometimes with polyarthralgia and polyar- thritis (Hall et al., 2002). As described for MVE, the geo- graphic range of Kunjin virus probably extends through New Guinea to parts of the eastern Indonesian archipelago, although this has only been indicated from serological data. Kunjin virus has also been reported from Sarawak, Borneo (Bowen et al., 1970), and Cambodia (J. Casals, personal communication to Bowen et al., 1970). Thus, the separate reports of WN virus and Kunjin virus in south-east Asia may be due to slight differences in the serological identifi- cation. However, sequence data have shown that a Sarawak strain of Kunjin virus is significantly different to other WN viruses (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002). WN virus exists in a number of distinct genetic lin- eages and sub-lineages (Fig. 3). The strain of WN virus that recently emerged in New York, and the virus strains responsible for most of the major disease outbreaks, are members of WN lineage 1a, whereas the original isolate of WN virus from Uganda belongs to lineage 2 (Berthet et al., 1997; Lanciotti et al., 1999; Scherret et al., 2002). Within lineage 1, two additional sub-lineages has been recognized – lineage 1b which contained all the Austral- asian Kunjin viruses, and lineage 1c which comprised four Indian WN virus isolates (Lanciotti et al., 1999; Scherret et al., 2001). However, in a more recent detailed phylogenetic study, Bondre et al. (2007) have described five genetic lineages; lineages 1a, 1b and 2 remain as described but the Indian isolates previously comprising lineage 1c have been placed in a new lineage, lineage 5. In addition, two newly described flaviviruses from the Czech Republic and the Caucasus, Rabensburg (Bakonyi et al., 2005) and LEIV-Krns88-190 (Lvov et al., 2004) respec- tively, have been placed into lineages 3 and 4. The Sara- wak Kunjin virus strain, however, is significantly different to the other Kunjin viruses, and it is suggested that this virus should be re-classified as lineage 6. Furthermore, the African virus, Koutango, is closely related to the WN virus lineages, and should perhaps be considered as a sev- enth lineage (Fig. 3). The vertebrate hosts of WN virus are birds, and in the old world, especially ardeid birds. In Australasia, Kunjin virus shares vertebrate hosts and vectors with MVE virus; thus the vertebrate hosts and vectors are ardeid birds, especially the Nankeen night heron, and vectors, such as Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes, respectively. However, there appears to be ecological differences between Kunjin and MVE, with Kunjin spreading into southern Australia more frequently than MVE virus. Tembusu, Sitiawan and ThCAr viruses Tembusu virus was first described in 1957 from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2), where it had been isolated from Cx. triteaniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus, Aedes linneatopennis, and Anopheles philippinensis (cited in Karabatsos, 1985). It was subsequently isolated in Thai- land from Cx. gelidus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, and Cx. sitiens (P.K. Russell, personal communication in Karabatsos, 1985; Leake et al., 1986) and in Sarawak from Cx. gelidus, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (Simpson et al., 1970; Platt et al., 1975). The reservoir hosts of Tembusu remain unknown, but there has been serological evidence to suggest that birds and domestic chickens may act as reservoirs (Platt et al., 1975; Wallace et al., 1977). Tembusu virus has not been associated with human disease, but neutralizing antibody to the virus has been reported in human sera from Kuala Lumpur and Sabah indicating the occurrence of asymptomatic infec- tions (Wallace et al., 1977; Karabatsos, 1985; Wolfe et al., 2001) and in Lombok, Indonesia (Olson et al., 1983), and Tembusu virus was shown to cause encephalitis in experi- mentally infected monkeys (C.E.G. Smith, unpublished results cited by Simpson et al., 1970). Two other related viruses have been described, ThCAr virus (Pandey et al., 1999) and Sitiawan virus (Kono et al., 2000) (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2). Both viruses are J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams The Zoonotic Flaviviruses ª 2009 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 345 genetically related to Tembusu (Kono et al., 2000), but serological tests demonstrated that they were distinct sub- types of Tembusu. ThCAr virus was isolated from from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes trapped in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 1992, but no disease associations have been observed (Pandey et al., 1999). Sitiawan virus was first described as a cause of encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chickens in Perak State, Malaysia, in 2000 (Kono et al., 2000), but there has been no evidence of human infections. Zika virus Zika virus is a relatively common virus throughout most of Africa, and has been associated with occasional human disease consisting of fever with headache and rash (Kar- abatsos, 1985). In Asia, serological evidence of Zika virus infections had been reported from India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines, but the virus was not isolated until 1966 when it was obtained from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia (Marchette et al., 1969) (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2). It was subsequently implicated as a cause of fever in patients in Central Java (Olson et al., 1981), and neutralizing antibodies were found in human sera collected from Lombok (Olson et al., 1983). The complete genome sequence of Zika virus was reported recently (Kuno and Chang, 2007). Zika virus emerged unexpect- edly in 2007 on the island of Yap and adjoining islands of Ulithi, Fais, Earpik, Woleai and Ifalik in the Federated States of Micronesia with over 150 cases (Press release from the Yap State EpiNet team, Yap State Department of Health Services, Colonia 96943, Yap State, FSM; Lanc- iotti et al., 2008). How and from where the virus moved to Yap State, remains unknown. Little is known about the reservoir hosts of Zika virus, although non-human pri- mates have been implicated in Africa (McCrae and Kirya, 1982). Recent studies have suggested that non-human primates may also be reservoir hosts in Asia, especially orangutans (Wolfe et al., 2001; Kilbourn et al., 2003). Wesselsbron and Jugra viruses Wesselsbron virus, an important cause of disease in humans and livestock in Africa, causing abortion in sheep and cattle, was isolated in Thailand (T. Yuill and P.K. Russell, personal communication to Karabatsos, 1985) (Table 1, Fig. 2). A total of four isolates were obtained from Aedes mediolineatus and Ae. lineatopeninis, but these isolates appear to have been lost when stocks held at the Armed Forces Research Institute for Medical Science in Bangkok could not be revived. There have been no further reports of Wesselsbron virus in Asia, but it would have been interesting to determine whether these isolates were genetically closer to Sepik virus, a related virus found in Papua New Guinea. The Asian isolates of Wesselsbron were not sequenced, and there was insuffi- cient sequence available in Genbank from the African iso- lates for inclusion in Fig. 1. Jugra virus (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2) was isolated in Malaysia from Aedes spp. and Uranotaenaia spp. of mosquitoes, and from the blood of the fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis (Karabatsos, 1985), but little is known about this virus. Edge Hill virus Edge Hill virus was first isolated in Cairns in 1961 (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2) (Doherty et al., 1963). It has subsequently been isolated from a range of mosquitoes trapped in north Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, including Cx. annulirostris, Ae. vigilax, Ae. normanensis, Ae. bancrofti- anus, An. amictus, and Coquillettidia linealis (reviewed in Mackenzie et al., 1994; Russell, 1995; Macdonald et al., 2001). The major vertebrate hosts are believed to be marsupials (Doherty et al., 1964; Hawkes et al., 1985). A sero-epidemiological study in New South Wales has sug- gested that occasional human infections occur (Hawkes et al., 1985), and there has been one unconfirmed report implicating Edge Hill virus as the possible aetiological agent in a patient presenting with arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue (Aaskov et al., 1993). Antigenic and genetic analy- ses have shown that distinct subtypes of Edge Hill virus exist in Western Australia and the Northern Territory (Macdonald et al., 2001). Sepik virus Sepik virus has only been isolated from Papua New Guinea (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2), although serological studies have suggested it might also occur elsewhere in the Indonesian archipelago. It was first isolated from Mansonia septem- punctata, Ficalbia flavens, Ficalbia spp., and Armigeres spp. trapped in the Sepik district of Papua New Guinea (Wood- roofe and Marshall, 1971; Karabatsos, 1985), and more recently, from Cx. sitiens subgroup mosquitoes trapped in Western Province of Papua New Guinea (Johansen et al., 2000; Nisbet et al., 2001). High neutralizing antibody titres in the convalescent serum of a New Guinea patient hospi- talized with a febrile disease makes it a suspected human pathogen (Woodroofe and Marshall, 1971). In addition, from its close antigenic relationship to Wesselsbron virus and from seroepidemiological studies on Lombok (Olson et al., 1983), there is a suggestion that it might infect live- stock. Sepik virus is the closest virus phylogenetically to yellow fever virus (Kuno and Chang, 2006), and is therefore particularly interesting on evolutionary grounds. The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 346 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 Kokobera, Stratford and New Mapoon viruses Kokobera and Stratford viruses are the only two members of the Kokobera serological group of Flaviviruses (Thiel et al., 2005), and New Mapoon virus is a recently isolated member of the group (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2) (Nisbet et al., 2005). Both viruses had originally been classified as members of the JE serological group, but antigenic (Hall et al., 1991) and genomic sequence analysis (Poidinger et al., 1996) suggested that they should be reclassified into their own group. Further genomic studies demonstrated that Kokobera virus exists in several different genetic subtypes in different parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea (Poidinger et al., 2000). Kokobera virus is enzo- otic to Australia and Papua New Guinea. The virus was first isolated from Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes trapped at Kowanyama (Mitchell River Mission) in northern Queensland in 1960 (Doherty et al.,1963). Since that time, the virus has been isolated from various species of mosquitoes in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and Papua New Guinea (Mackenzie et al., 1994; Russell, 1995). Most recently, it has spread into the south-west of Western Australia (Poi- dinger et al., 2000). Serological evidence suggests that kangaroos and other macropods are the major wildlife reservoirs, although horses may also act as reservoir hosts (Doherty et al., 1964, 1971). Seroepidemiological studies in New South Wales, Queensland and Papua New Guinea have indicated that occasional human infections occur with Kokobera virus, and indeed, it was subsequently shown to be the cause of rare cases of acute polyarticular disease in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales (Doherty et al., 1964; Hawkes et al., 1985, 1993; Bough- ton et al., 1986). Stratford virus is enzootic in Australia and possibly in Papua New Guinea. It was first isolated from Ae. vigilax mosquitoes trapped in Cairns in north Queensland in 1961 (Doherty et al., 1963). Stratford virus has been iso- lated from several mosquito species, including Ae. vigilax in Queensland and New South Wales, and Cx. annuliros- tris, Ae. procax and Ae. notoscriptus in New South Wales. However, the role of each of these in transmission is unknown. Seroepidemiological studies carried out in New South Wales suggested that occasional human infections had occurred (Hawkes et al., 1985), but there has been no reported association with human disease. Two other related viruses have been reported from Cape York, northern Australia. After monoclonal anti- body analysis and sequencing studies, one of these viruses was deemed to be a distant subtype of Kokobera virus, but the other was shown to be a distinct yet related virus, and the name New Mapoon virus has been suggested (Nisbet et al., 2005). Tick-borne Flaviviruses Six tick-borne flaviviruses have been described from southern, south-eastern, and eastern Asia, and from Australasia (Table 2, Figs 1 and 2). Two of the viruses were reported from Australasia, GGY virus and SRE virus. GGY virus was isolated from Ixodes (Ceratixodes) uriae ticks collected from 1975 to 1979 on Macquarie Island, in the southern Pacific Ocean, south of Tasmania (St George et al., 1985). Ticks were collected from areas inhabited by Royal penguins (Eudy- ptes chrysolophus schlegeli), however, disease association with seabirds has not been established and a limited serological survey of flavivirus antibodies in birds trapped on Macquarie Island was inconclusive (St George et al., 1985). Although GGY virus belongs to the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group, it is associated with seabird transmission cycles. Further, GGY virus does not display the clinal geographic distribution reported for other mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses. It has therefore been suggested that it may constitute an evolutionary link between seabird-associated viruses and the more recently Table 2.

SRE virus was isolated in 1974 from soft ticks (Ornithodoros capensis) collected from the nests of seabirds, Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata), on Saumarez Reef and Frederick Reef off the east coast of Queensland, and from hard ticks (I. eudpyptidis) collected from Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae) in Tasmania (St George et al., 1977). This investigation was initiated following reports of febrile illness in meteorological workers operating on Saumerez Reef, who had been bitten by ticks. However, infection with SRE virus was not confirmed in these cases and association of SRE virus with human disease has not since been reported. A large sero-epidemiological survey of �17 000 human sera collected from New South Wales also failed to find any evidence of human infection with either SRE virus, or GGY virus (Hawkes et al., 1985). Similarly, in a subsequent sero-survey of human and avian residents of the Coral Sea and the Great Barrier Reef, off the east coast of Queensland, no evidence for human infections with SRE virus was found, despite the presence of neutralizing (NT) antibodies in seabirds (Humphery-Smith et al., 1991). Interestingly, this study also revealed the presence of NT antibodies to GGY virus in equal proportions (4%) in the human and avian popu- lations tested. The potential pathogenicity of SRE virus for seabirds was indicated by small scale experimental infections of little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor), which led to disease and mortality 9–13 days post-inocu- lation (Morgan et al., 1985). Further experimental and field investigations of SRE virus and GGY virus will be required to fully delineate the pathogenic potential of these viruses in avian and human populations. Four tick-borne flaviviruses have been described from eastern, south-eastern and southern Asia. LGT virus was first isolated in Malaysia from I. granulatus hard ticks collected from two species of forest rats (Rattus mulleri and R. sabanus) (Smith, 1956). Subsequently, LGT virus was isolated in Thailand from Haemaphysalis papuana soft ticks associated with several species of forest rats (R. rattus, R. fulvescens, R. niviventor, R. surifer), implying that this virus may be widely distributed in forests throughout South-East Asia (Bancroft et al., 1976). No apparent human disease association has been found for endemic south-east Asian strains of LGT virus – a prop- erty that has led to the evaluation of the Malaysian TP21 strain as a vaccine candidate for TBE virus (Gritsun et al., 2003). However, in Russia during the 1970s, a small number of human cases of meningoencephalitis were observed in recipients of a live-attenuated LGT-based vac- cine for TBE (reviewed in Gritsun et al., 2003). In Japan, Negishi virus – a mammalian tick-borne flavivirus – was first isolated in Tokyo from an encephalitis patient in 1948 (Ando et al., 1952). There was a second fatal case from Tokyo shortly after and human cases have been rec- ognized in China. More recently, genetic characterization of Negishi virus indicated it is a strain of Louping ill virus (Venugopal et al., 1992). No further cases of Negishi virus infection have been reported and no endemic foci or tick vectors have been identified, and there has been speculation about its possible origin. The first human case of TBE caused by a subtype, Russian Spring Summer encephalitis virus, was reported in 1993 on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido (Takashima et al., 1997), located in close proximity to Maritime Siberia where TBE virus is known to be prevalent. Further investigations on Hokkaido led to virus isolations from sentinel dogs, from I. granulatus ticks, and from small mammals (Apodemus speciosus and Clethrionomys rufocanus) (Takashima et al., 1997; Takeda et al., 1998, 1999), demonstrating endemic foci throughout the island. The Japanese strains of TBE virus are divided into three groups within the Far-eastern subtype and recent phylogenetic evidence indicated that transmission of the virus between Russia and Japan has occurred at least three times in the past 700 years – prob- ably via the East Asian-Australian flyway of migratory birds (Suzuki, 2007). KFD virus is the major tick-borne virus from southern Asia. It emerged in 1957 in Karna- taka State of southern India, and continues to be restricted to that State (Rodrigues, 1988; Pattnaik, 2006), although there is some suggestive evidence that silent transmission may also occur elsewhere in India and the Andaman and Nicobar islands (Pattnaik, 2006). It causes a prostrating human febrile disease with haemorrhagic and encephalitic manifestations and a case fatality rate of between 5% and 10% (Rodrigues, 1988; Pattnaik, 2006). Interestingly, a novel but closely related virus emerged in 1992 in Saudi Arabia, Alkhurma virus; over 60 human cases of Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever disease have been reported, mainly from Mecca and Jeddah, with several deaths (Zaki, 1997; Charrel et al., 2001; Pattnaik, 2006), demonstrating once again that novel pathogenic flavivi- ruses may emerge at any time. Flaviviruses With no Known Vector There are at least four flaviviruses reported from Eastern and South-Eastern Asia with no known vector (Thiel et al., 2005; Table 3, Figs 1 and 2). These include Apoi and Yokose viruses from Japan, Carey Island virus from Malaysia, Phnom Penh bat virus from Malaysia and Cam- bodia (Salaun et al., 1974; Karabatsos, 1985). An addi- tional virus, Batu Cave virus, is believed to be a subtype of Phnom Penh virus. Apoi virus was first isolated from rodents in 1954 in Japan. Isolates have been reported from Apodemus specio- sus and Ap. argentosus hokkaidi, and from Clethrionomys The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 348 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 species. Apoi virus has been classified as a member of the Modoc virus group, and has only been found on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Antibodies to Apoi virus have been found in humans and horses in Hokkaido, and the virus has been associated with human disease causing CNS symptoms and leg paralysis. The other three viruses have all been isolated from bats, and none have been associated with disease in either bats or humans (Karabat- sos, 1985). Carey Island virus has been isolated from two species of fruit bat, Macroglossus lagochilus and Cynopterus brachyotis, in Peninsula Malaysia; Phnom Penh bat virus was first isolated from the salivary glands and brown fat of the Cy. brachiotus angulatus bats collected at the Chrui-Chang-War peninsula, Phnom Penh, Cambodia in June 1969, and from Cy. brachyotis and Eonycteris spelaea bats in Malaysia; and Yokose virus was isolated from an insectivorous bat, Miniopterus fuliginosus (Japanese long- fingered bat), caught on Kyushu Island, Japan, in 1971 (Karabatsos, 1985; Tajima et al., 2005). Carey Island and Phnom Penh bat viruses are species in the Rio Bravo virus group (Thiel et al., 2005), whereas Yokose virus is a member of the Entebbe bat virus group (Karabatsos, 1985; Kuno et al., 1998; Tajima et al., 2005). Interestingly, the Entebbe bat virus group members are not closely related phylogenetically to the other flaviviruses with no known vector, but are closely related to yellow fever virus and other related mosquito-borne viruses (Fig. 1). They can replicate in mosquito and mammalian cells (Kuno and Chang, 2006), so whether they can also be vectored by mosquitoes must remain a possibility. Evolution and Phylogeny of Flaviviruses The increasing availability of partial and full-length geno- mic sequence information for members of the Flavivirus genus have enabled the resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of these viruses. This work underlies current hypotheses on their origins, evolution and dispersal. Phylogenetic reconstructions have identified three distinct clades belonging to the mosquito-, tick-borne, and no known vector viruses (Zanotto et al., 1996; Kuno et al., 1998; Billoir et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001; Fig. 1). Depending on the region of the genome analysed, the evolution of these groups can be explained by two conflicting theories: (i) the no known vector group diverged from an ancestor virus before the vector-borne viruses (NS5 gene), and (ii) the no known vector and tick-borne viruses evolved as a sister group from a com- mon ancestor, with the mosquito-borne viruses arising independently (NS3 gene, complete open reading frame). The latter hypothesis has gained recent support from a comprehensive phylogenetic study by Cook and Holmes (2006), demonstrating that the NS3-based phylogeny pro- vided statistically significant evidence of mosquito-borne viruses evolving as an outgroup to the remaining flavi- viruses. In contrast, the NS5 data set did not contain suf- ficient phylogenetic signal to support either theory. Regardless, it is accepted that the acquisition of tick- borne transmission is a derived trait since all phylogenetic analyses show the tick-borne group to diverge from one of the other two flavivirus groups (Kuno et al., 1998; Billoir et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001; Cook and Holmes, 2006). Within the mosquito-borne group, viruses are sub-divided into Aedes and Culex clades, reflecting the predominant vector of the viruses in each group (Billoir et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001). These groupings correlate with vertebrate host and disease syndrome. Thus, the Culex clade contains neurotropic viruses, such as JE and WN, associated with bird reservoir hosts, while viruses belonging to the Aedes clade, such yellow fever and den- gue, associate with haemorrhagic disease and primate hosts (Gaunt et al., 2001). Two main clades have been identified for the tick-borne viruses, one associated with sea-birds and one associated with rodent hosts, the latter containing the TBE viruses. The no known vector viruses form three groups, of which one is associated with bats and two with rodent hosts (Kuno et al., 1998; Gaunt et al., 2001). Interestingly, the Entebbe Bat group of no known vector viruses clusters within the mosquito-borne group (Kuno et al., 1998) and is thought to indicate sec- ondary loss of vector-borne transmission (Cook and Holmes, 2006), but may also reflect the failure to isolate mosquito vectors of these viruses. There is compelling evidence to suggest that the flavivi- ruses have their origins in the Old World (Gaunt et al., Table 3. Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern and Eastern Asia, and Australasia, with No Known Vector Serological group Virus Region/country Host Year of first isolation Disease Entebbe bat virus group Yokose virus Japan Bats 1971 None known Modoc virus group Apoi virus Japan Rodents 1954 CNS symptoms Rio Bravo virus group Carey Island virus Malaysia Bats 1970 None known Phnom Penh bat virus (incl. Batu cave virus) Cambodia, Malaysia Bats 1969 None known J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams The Zoonotic Flaviviruses ª 2009 The Authors Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 349 2001; Gould et al., 2003). Thus, the earliest lineage of the mosquito-borne group is the Aedes-associated virus clade, from which the Culex-borne clade is descendent. Viruses from the Aedes group are thought to have African ancestry since the majority are found on this continent. Only yellow fever and the dengue viruses of the Aedes clade are found in the New World; their emergence there has been proposed to have occurred during the slave trade from the Old World to the Americas (Gaunt et al., 2001; Gould et al., 2003). Phylogenetic trees of the mos- quito-borne viruses reveal a two-phase pattern in which a slow branching process is followed by rapid growth, with poor geographic structure and frequent lineage extinction (Zanotto et al., 1996). This was explained by the existence of mosquito-borne flaviviruses in low-prevalence endemic cycles up until recently (�200 years ago) when the avail- ability of new and susceptible hosts, coupled with increas- ing worldwide movement and mixing of vectors, viruses and hosts led to a massive virus population expansion (Zanotto et al., 1996). Thus, in South-East Asia, some of the viruses of the JE group have been hypothesized to arise in the Indo-Malaysian region from an ancestral virus of African origin (Solomon et al., 2003; Gould et al., 2004). From this region, and aided by human activities promoting vector-bird transmission such as rice cultiva- tion, dispersal and subsequent speciation has led to their current biogeography. Evidence of African ancestry of the JE group is observed by the close phylogenetic relation- ship of JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses of South East Asia and Australasia with the African virus Usutu (Fig. 3). Unlike other members of the JE group, WN virus is thought to have first emerged from Africa before spreading north- ward and eastward via migratory birds (Gould et al., 2003). How the South-East Asian types of West Nile became established is not fully understood, however, it has been hypothesised that Malaysian and Australian sub- types evolved from a common ancestor (Scherret et al., 2001). It is conceivable that this may have taken place in the Indo-Malaysian region, as proposed for JE virus (Solomon et al., 2003). It is notable that the African virus Koutango clusters within the WN virus group in phylo- genetic reconstructions, indicating that this virus is a line- age of WN virus (Fig. 3). This may reflect the origin of the WN virus species; however, further sequence informa- tion for Koutango will be required to better establish the phylogenetic relationships of this virus. Of the tick-borne flaviviruses, virtually all are found in the Old World. Phylogenetic analyses have provided evidence that the mammalian tick-borne viruses have evolved gradually along a geographical cline over the past 2000 years after an initial dispersal event from Africa (Zanotto et al., 1995, 1996; Gould et al., 2004). These viruses dispersed north and westwards across the forests of Asia and Europe from an ancestral lineage in the east- ern part of its geographic range, with the more recent species occurring in the north-western end of its range. This contrasts with the pattern of evolution and dispersal of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses and is thought to reflect the lifecycle of ticks (Zanotto et al., 1996). For example, the tick generation time can be measured in months to years and direct virus transmission can occur between vectors during co-feeding on non-viraemic hosts, enabling viral lineages to survive for relatively long peri- ods. While phylogenetic evidence indicates that the Far- eastern subtype of TBE virus found in Japan originated from Russia (Suzuki, 2007), the origins of other mamma- lian tick-borne flaviviruses listed in Table 2 are not clear. The seabird tick-borne viruses are associated with seabird ticks and have mainly been isolated in the Old World. In contrast with the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses, there is no evidence of a close relationship between genetic evolution and geographic distribution (Grard et al., 2007). It is therefore assumed that seabird tick- borne flaviviruses have been disseminated by independent migratory flights and that their observed genetic evolution reflects adaptation to the different ecological niches they have reached (Grard et al., 2007). The emergence of the Australian seabird-associated viruses GGY and SRE may have thus occurred via migratory seabirds from the northern hemisphere. Indeed, St George et al. (1985) sug- gested that GGY virus represents a genetic link between subarctic and subantarctic tick-borne viruses based on the identification of the seabird species Oceanites oceanicus and Sterna paradisaea, which breed in the Arctic and migrate to the Antarctic and vice versa (respectively). The no known vector viruses are found in either the Old World or the New World, implying that they were dispersed widely following their emergence (Gaunt et al., 2001; Gould et al., 2003). While bat-associated no known vector viruses are found in the Old World and New World, the rodent-associated no known vector viruses are found mainly in the New World, with the notable exception of Apoi virus, which is found in Japan. The latter distribution is consistent with a single dispersal event (such as bat migration) from the Old World followed by local infection of rodents and subse- quently restricted distribution (Gaunt et al., 2001). Thus, the no vector viruses of South-East Asia (Table 3) are likely to have emerged from migratory bats and estab- lished localized transmission cycles in bat colonies or rodent populations. Emergence and Spread of Flaviviruses Flaviviruses have a strong predeliction to spread and establish in new areas, as recently described for WN virus The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams ª 2009 The Authors 350 Journal compilation ª 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 338–356 in the Americas (reviewed by Gubler, 2007), for JE virus in Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait of northern Australia (reviwed by Mackenzie et al., 2007), and for Usutu virus in Austria (Weissenböck et al., 2002), and subsequently elsewhere in Europe, including Spain (Bus- quets et al., 2008), Hungary (Bakonyi et al., 2007), and Italy (Rizzoli et al., 2007). This latter spread is particularly interesting as Usutu virus is one the closest viruses phylo- genetically to MVE virus. Thus known flaviviruses may emerge in a new locality unexpectedly and sometimes over long distances, probably due largely to the migratory habits of avian vertebrate hosts. However, over the past decade, a number of new, pre- viously unrecognized flaviviruses have also been reported, including Rabensburg virus in the Czech Republic (Bak- onyi et al., 2005), Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia (Zaki, 1997; Charrel et al., 2001; Pattnaik, 2006), Sitiawan virus in Malaysia (Kono et al., 2000), ThCAr virus in Thailand (Pandey et al., 1999), LEIV-Krns88-190 in the Caucasus region (Lvov et al., 2004; and New Mapoon virus in Aus- tralia (Nisbet et al., 2005). It is difficult to assign a spe- cific reason for the emergence of these novel viruses, and in most cases their detection has been due either to a newly recognized disease entity, as described for Akhurma and Sitiawan viruses, or serendipity through the field col- lection of arthropods for studies of other and often related viruses. As an example, Rabensburg virus was iso- lated from mosquitoes trapped during a flood in 1997 near the Czech-Austrian border, and although cases of febrile illness due to WN virus had been reported previ- ously from the Czech Republic, there had been no disease outbreak at the time of collection (Bakonyi et al., 2005). New hosts may also lead to new genetic variants, as seen with LEIV-Krns88-190 which was isolated from ticks rather than the more usual mosquito vectors. With the ease with which these viruses have been detected, it is probable that many other flaviviruses exist and remain to be discovered. A number of factors may contribute to the risk or potential of emergence, including changes in land use, especially if involving new ecological niches, increas- ing travel and trade, increasing urbanization and popula- tion density, and changes to climate and weather through global warming. Many of these factors have been impor- tant in national developments in the Asia-Pacific regions, especially the changes in land use, including deforestation, to provide increased agricultural land for rice growing, and increased urbanization and population density giving rise to mega-cities. The strong inter-dependence of mos- quito-borne virus ecology with climatic factors would suggest that the global warming and climatic changes may have a significant affect on the potential for new virus emergence and for the increased spread and incidence of many known viruses. Rabensburg virus may be viewed as an example of this as it was first described following severe flooding. Thus, new previously unrecognized flaviviruses may arise anywhere and at anytime, and there is little doubt that with these viruses we should expect the unexpected. Conclusions As shown in this brief review, the genus Flaviviridae con- sists of a number of viruses, some of which are associated with severe human disease including encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever, some with mild, febrile disease, but most have no known association with disease in either humans or animals. The members of the genus have a well recognized propensity to spread and establish in new areas, and although their characteristics are well defined, they are still unpredictable and may exhibit increases in disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, unex- pected methods of transmission, and long-term persis- tence (Gould and Solomon, 2006). Furthermore, and as exemplified by New Mapoon in Australasia, by Sitiawan virus in southern Asia, by Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia, and by Rabensburg in the Czech Republic, new flaviviruses continue to be found. Thus as a genus, they are well suited to be the source of new, zoonotic emergent diseases. References Aaskov, J. G., D. A. Phillips, and M. A.

Blood samples were taken from 16 Hoffman’s two-toed sloths (HTSs; Choloepus hoffmanni) and 26 brown-throated sloths (BTSs; Bradypus variegatus) over a 3-yr period. We used serologic assays to detect antibodies against 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths (St. Louis encephalitis [SLEV], Changuinola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Ilheus [ILHV], Oropouche, Mayaro, Utinga, Murutucu, Punta Toro, and vesicular stomatitis [VSV] viruses) and six arboviruses not described in sloths (Rio Grande, West Nile [WNV], eastern equine encephalitis, Piry, Munguba, and La Crosse viruses). Overall, 80% of sloths had detectable antibodies to SLEV, 67% had antibodies to ILHV, 32% to Punta Toro virus, 30% to Changuinola virus, 15% to WNV, 14% to VSV, 11% to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and 10% to Rio Grande virus. No samples had detectable antibodies to the remaining eight viruses. We found a significant increase in prevalence of antibody to VSV in HTSs between 2005 and 2007, and for WNV antibody between 2005 and 2006. We found no significant differences in the prevalences of antibodies to the sampled viruses between the two locations. Antibody prevalences were significantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs for SLEV in 2005. Antibody-positive results for ILHV were likely due to cross-reaction with SLEV. The novel finding of antibodies to Rio Grande virus in sloths could be due to cross-reaction with another phlebovirus. These findings might have implications for land management and domestic animal health. Due to the nature of the study, we could not determine whether sloths could represent amplification hosts for these viruses, or whether they were only exposed and could be used as sentinel species. Further studies are needed to fully characterize arboviral exposure in sloths. Key words: Arbovirus, Bradypus variegatus, Choloepus hoffmanni, serology, sloth. 883 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis INTRODUCTION Choloepus hoffmanni and Bradypus varie- gatus, commonly known as the Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (HTS) and the brown-throated sloth (BTS), respectively, are hosts for many tropical arboviruses with potential public health implications (Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c; Gilmore et al. 2001). Additionally, sloths are hosts to some viruses often shared between livestock and other domesticated species (Seymour et al. 1983c; Figueiredo 2007). The low metabolism of sloths could be associated with a long-lasting viremia for many viruses, which might increase transmis- sion stability (Seymour et al. 1983a). We screened for antibody to selected arboviruses in populations of BTSs and HTSs inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica. The viruses included 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths: St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), Changuinola (CGLV), Ilheus (ILHV), Oropouche (OROV), Mayaro (MAYV), Utinga (UTIV), Murutucu (MURV), Punta Toro (PTV), and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) viruses (Tesh et al. 1969; Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c; Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al. 2001) and six arboviruses not reported in sloths: Rio Grande (RGV), West Nile (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV), Piry (PIRYV), Munguba (MUNV), and La Crosse (LCV) viruses. Flaviviruses Among flaviviruses, we investigated expo- sure to WNV, ILHV, and SLEV, all vectored by mosquitoes (Pauvolid-Correa et al. 2013; Rivarola et al. 2014). Saint Louis encephalitis virus infects a variety of vertebrate hosts, among which sloths, primates, birds, marsu- pials, and armadillos are considered reservoirs (Seymour et al. 1983a; Figueiredo 2007). Free-ranging BTSs in Panama maintain a high SLEV antibody prevalence of 39% (Seymour et al. 1983b). Experimental infec- tion with SLEV in sloths produced a high-titer and long-lasting antibody response compared to other hosts (Seymour et al. 1983a). Sloths are relatively poor amplification hosts after mosquito inoculation compared to chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) or mice (Mus musculus; Seymour et al. 1983a). Despite low transmission, because sloths are relatively common in Central American forests (Eisen- berg and Thorington 1973; Montgomery and Sunquist 1978), they are considered important hosts in the transmission of SLEV. Alphaviruses Some alphaviruses are emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, VEEV, MAYV, and EEEV (Figueiredo 2007; Cassadou et al. 2014; Fischer and Staples 2014; Horcada et al. 2015). Three of these (VEEV, EEEV, and MAYV) are zoonotic and widespread in South America (Hubalek et al. 2014). Mayaro virus causes epidemics of febrile exanthematous illness in humans in Latin America, often accompanied by arthralgia (Woodall 1967; de Thoisy et al. 2003). It is a major arboviral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and relevant to public health in rural South America (de Thoisy et al. 2003; Figueiredo 2007; Figueiredo and Figueiredo 2014). Sloths with MAYV antibody have been reported in French Guyana (de Thoisy et al. 2003) but not in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). Orthobunyaviruses La Crosse virus is one of the four primary causes of zoonotic encephalitis in the US (Go et al. 2014). Humans are considered dead-end hosts (Smith et al. 2006; Go et al. 2014) but, when symptomatic, frequently present with influenza-like clinical signs and encephalitis (Go et al. 2014). No disease is documented in animals. Prevalence of LCV antibodies has not been studied in sloths. Rio Grande virus is a member of the phlebotomus fever group. The primary vector is the hematophagous sand fly Lutzomyia anthophora (Endris et al. 1983). This virus has not been investigated in sloths. Oropouche virus is a zoonotic Orthobunya- virus causing acute Oropouche fever (Figueir- edo 2007). The sylvatic cycle includes sloths as reservoirs and mosquitoes as vectors (Pinheiro et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007). The urban cycle involves humans with Culex quinquefasciatus 884 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 52, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis and Culicoides paraensis midges as vectors (Pinheiro et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007). Oropouche virus was described in Brazil in 1960, when it was isolated from a pale- throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridacty- lus) captured near a forested area during construction of the Belem-Brasilia highway (Woodall 1967). Utinga virus has been documented in pale- throated three-toed sloth in Utinga forest, Belem, Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Punta Toro virus is a rare zoonotic virus causing febrile illness in humans and vectored by sand flies Lutzomyia spp. (Seymour et al. 1983c). It was studied as a model for Rift Valley fever infection in laboratory animals (Ashley et al. 2011) and has been used as a vaccine candidate against Rift Valley fever (Lihorado- va et al. 2013). Murutucu virus was isolated from a BTS in Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Phleboviruses Rio Grande virus is a member of the phlebotomus fever group and has not been investigated in sloths. The primary vector is the hematophagous sand fly, Lutzomyia an- thophora (Endris et al. 1983). A Munguba virus antibody-positive HTS was found in Monte Dourado, Jari, Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Orbiviruses Changuinola virus is a rare zoonotic orbivi- rus with only one reported case of febrile human disease (Woodall 1967). The primary vector in Brazil and Panama is the sandfly, Lutzomyia umbratilis (Woodall 1967). Anti- body-positive sloths have been reported in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983a, b) and Brazil (Gilmore et al. 2001) and are believed to be reservoirs for this virus (Seymour et al. 1983c). Vesiculoviruses Vesicular stomatitis is a reportable disease to the Office International des Epizooties. Sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.) and black flies (Simulium spp.) are vectors (Comer et al. 1990; Cupp et al. 1992; Mead 2006). Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) are suspect- ed to be a maintenance host for VSV (Trujillo et al. 2010), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) may represent an amplifying host (Mead 2006). Although VSV may cause a flu-like disease in humans (Mead 2006), the primary concern is to livestock in the agrarian regions of Costa Rica (Atwill et al. 1993). Panamanian sloths have been found to be antibody positive for VSV Indiana serotype by plaque reduction neutralization test, with 32% of Choloepus spp. and 15% of Bradypus spp. antibody positive (Tesh et al. 1969). Antibodies against Piry virus have been identified in a wide variety of mammals (Wilks and House 1984) including Xenarthra in Brazil with 8.8% antibody prevalence (CDC 2014). MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected blood samples from two sloth species inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica between July and August in 2005–07. We chose two locations corresponding with ongoing wildlife research projects tracking the movement of free- ranging sloths. The primary location used for capture was Finmac, a 107-ha organic cacao plantation in northeastern Costa Rica (10820 00N, 83820 00W), surrounded by banana and pineapple plantations and pastures. The second location, used for collection in 2007 only, was a cacao plantation outside of the community of Upala (108540N, 85820W), surrounded by pasture, sparse forest, and pineapple plantations. Participants included wildlife biologists, veterinarians, and veterinary students from the Universidad Nacio- nal (Heredia, Costa Rica) and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora permits and local permis- sions were obtained for sample collection. All procedures in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin. Sloths were captured manually, placed in burlap sacks, and transported to a consistent location before being anesthetized as described by Hanley et al. (2008). Time between capture and release did not exceed 12 h. Capture location was documented for each sloth by GPS to ensure return to the original capture site. After transpor- tation, each sloth was immobilized with medeto- midine 0.02 mg/kg (1 mg/mL; Domitort, Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, Pennsylvania, USA) and MEDLIN ET AL.—PATHOGENS IN FREE-RANGING SLOTHS IN COSTA RICA 885 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis ketamine hydrochloride 2.5 mg/kg (100 mg/mL; Ketavett, Revetmex, Colonia Prado Churubsco, Deleg, Coyoacan, Mexico). Anesthetic monitoring was performed by one of the investigators (C.S.H.) and included respiratory rate and heart rate via Doppler flow probe and stethoscope. A full physical exam was completed. Blood samples were collected from the cephalic, saphenous, or femoral veins, or the cranial vena cava, and preserved in 2.0 mL heparinized tubes. Blood samples were centrifuged within 60 min of collection, and serum was placed in 1.8 mL plastic microtainers (Nalgene screw-top, Lima, Ohio, USA), and kept in an ice chest until frozen at �4 C. Each sloth had a passive integrated transponder (ID 100US, Trovan Ltd., Santa Barbara, California, USA) implanted subcutane- ously in the interscapular region to prevent resampling during the same year. Prior to recovery, each sloth received 20–100 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution (Hospira, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) subcutaneously. Atipame- zole 0.1 mg/kg was administered intramuscularly to antagonize medetomidine. After complete recovery, sloths were released at their capture site. Frozen sera were transported to the Univer- sity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, US, for testing. Serologic testing Hemaglutination inhibition (HI) test: Sera were tested for antibodies to EEEV, ILHV, MAYV, MUNV, MURV, OROV, RGV, SLEV, UTIV, and VEEV. The HI tests were performed in microtiter plates as described by Shope (1963). Nonspecific inhibitors of sera were acetone extracted by a classical technique (Clarke and Casals 1958). To remove goose cell agglutinins, rehydrated sera (pH 9.0 borate saline) were adsorbed with goose cells. Tests were performed with 4 units of antigen, obtained by sucrose acetone extraction and inactivated by treatment with betapropiolac- tone, against 1:10 serum dilution used for screening. Complement fixation (CF) test: Sera were screened for antibodies to six arbovirus antigens: ILHV, SLEV, LCV, PTV, CGLV, and PIRYV. Testing by CF was performed using a micro- technique following Beaty et al. (1989). The highest dilutions giving 3þ or 4þ fixation of complement (scale of 0–4) were recorded as positive, and a positive result for the 1:10 dilution was considered antibody positive. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT): All sera SLEV- and VEEV-positive by HI were tested by PRNT to confirm specificity using strains T35573 and 68U201, respectively. In addition, sera were tested for WNV and VSV using strains NY99 and Mudd-Summers, respec- tively. Serum samples were serially diluted and incubated with 100 plaque-forming units of virus before inoculation onto confluent Vero cells as described by Seymour et al. (1983c). Serologic test variability depending on the year: Due to test availability and financial limitations, some tests were conducted only in some years. We investigated the presence of antibodies to SLEV, VEEV, ILHV, OROV, MAYV, MURV, and WNV every year. In 2007 the VEEV HI test was refined to detect specific antibodies against the subtype I variant AB, typically responsible for epizootic outbreaks, and subtype II. In 2007 PRNT was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies against VEEV subtype I variant E. The VSV PRNT was conducted in 2005 and 2007. Serologic testing for CGLV, UTIV, PIRYV, and LCV was conducted in 2005 and 2006 but not in 2007. Serologic testing for PTV and MUNV was performed only in 2005, and RGV and EEEV were tested only in 2007. Statistical analysis Yearly antibody prevalence for each virus was calculated by dividing the total number of antibody-positive animals by the total number of sloths sampled, including sloths resampled each year. Statistical tests were conducted using GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Califor- nia, USA). Differences between sampling loca- tions were evaluated with Fisher’s exact test. For arboviruses evaluated during multiple years, differences between years were also evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. For all tests, statistical significance was set at P,0.05. RESULTS From 2005 to 2007, we collected 109 blood samples from 94 adult free-ranging sloths, including 26 BTSs and 68 HTSs. We collected 45 samples in 2005, 43 in 2006, and 21 in 2007. During physical examinations of 95 sloths, ticks, flies, and moths were present on most sloths. All sloths recovered from anesthesia uneventfully. Serologic results for the 109 samples are detailed in Table 1, and antibody titers are summarized in Table 2. Overall, via HI and CF techniques, 87 of the 109 samples (80%) were positive for antibody to SLEV. Preva- lences of detectable antibody to other viruses were IHLV: 73/109 (67%), PTV: 12/37 (32%), CGLV: 26/88 (30%), WNV: 12/82 (15%), VEEV: 12/109 (11%), VSV: 10/109 (9%), and 886 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 52, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis RGV: 2/21 (10%). Nine of 66 samples (14%) were positive for VSV by PRNT. Antibodies to WNV, VSV, and CGLV were detected only in BTSs. There were no detectable antibodies found during any sampling period for the remaining eight viruses. We sampled 13 sloths during 2 yr, and one sloth during all 3 yr. Among the recaptured sloths, 7/13 had a consistent titer for SLEV, three had increasing titers, two had decreas- ing titers, and one was antibody negative during the 3-yr sampling period. Discrepancies were found between the results of the HI assays and PRNT80 in four of 12 serum samples for VEEV and in 41 of 87 positive samples for SLEV antibody. In all cases, sera were positive for VEEV or SLEV antibodies via HI, but negative via PRNT80. Because the PRNT is considerably more specific, the results obtained by HI in these cases could reflect cross-reactions with other, unknown viruses. All of these sloths were negative for WNV and SLEV antibodies by PRNT80. Antibodies to VEEV were found at both locations, and in both sloth species. During 2006 none of the BTSs were antibody positive. During 2007, two of three BTSs from the Upala plantation had antibody to VEEV enzootic subtype IE. Three of four HTSs positive for VEEV-IE antibody during 2007 did not have measurable titers for either subtype IAB or II. The remaining HTS had a higher titer for VEEV-IE antibody than TABLE 1.

Antibody to Rio Grande virus was detected in two of 21 individuals via HI in 2007 (Table 2). The positive sloths were one female adult HTS at Finmac and one female adult BTS at Upala. We analyzed changes in antibody preva- lence for a few viruses. Between 2005 and 2007 there were no significant variations in prevalence of antibodies to ILHV or SLEV in either sloth species (P¼0.16–1.0). Between 2005 and 2007, a significant increase in VSV antibody prevalence was determined in HTSs, from 4% to 44% (P¼0.001). Between 2005 and 2006, a significant increase in WNV antibody prevalence from 8% to 27% was measured in HTSs, (P,0.001) while no WNV antibody- positive BTSs were detected in either year. Regarding variations between sloth species, antibody prevalence was significantly higher in HTSs compared to BTSs for SLEV and ILHV in 2005 (P¼0.008), whereas in 2006 and 2007, prevalence was not significantly differ- ent between sloth species for any of the screened antibodies. For VEEV and RGV antibodies, no significant difference was detected between sloth species. When com- paring locations, there were no significant differences in prevalence for any antibodies. DISCUSSION We conducted comprehensive serologic testing in sloths in Costa Rica, confirming exposure of sloth populations to, at least, eight arboviruses. Rio Grande virus Rio Grande virus was detected in two of 21 sloths but was evaluated only in 2007. These may represent a cross reaction with a closely related Phlebovirus or might be true positives. This virus cross-reacts only rarely with other TABLE 2.

To date, RGV has been isolated in Texas (Calisher et al. 1977) and Mexico (Deardorff et al. 2011). Sand flies are vectors of RGV and VSV (Mead 2006), so the presence of these vectors in Costa Rica (Jimenez et al. 2000a) might be associated with transmission of both viruses being described in Costa Rican sloths. Punta Toro virus We detected antibody to PTV in 12 of 37 HTSs evaluated only in 2006. Antibodies against PTV were found in BTSs (8/106) and HTSs (11/66) in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983c). Unfortunately, PTV and RGV anti- bodies were not tested during the same years, and it was not possible to determine whether some RGV antibody-positive sloths could also be positive for PTV antibody. This requires further evaluation. Vesicular stomatitis virus Costa Rica is endemic for VSV (Jimenez et al. 2000b). Similar to a previous study in Panama (Tesh et al. 1969), we detected sloths with antibody for the VSV Indiana serotype. Production of neutralizing anti- bodies results in cessation of virus shedding (Mead 2006). Although this has not been investigated specifically in xenarthrans, the antibody-positive sloths we detected are unlikely to represent a source of infection for other animals. In addition, experimental studies have shown that biting insects become infected with VSV when feeding on or near virus-rich vesicular lesions (Mead 2006), none of which were observed on physical examinations of VSV antibody-pos- itive sloths. No sloths had detectable anti- body to PIRYV, which rules out a cross- reaction between these two vesiculoviruses. We found that prevalence of antibody to VSV increased significantly in HTSs between 2005 and 2007. In addition, all antibody- positive sloths were from Finmac, which could reflect the involvement of environ- mental factors. Climatic conditions in be- tween sampling areas are different, and weather variability is also expected in the same area each year due to the El Niño southern oscillation. These environmental parameters could have affected multiple serologic results. Further work is needed to investigate whether VSV can have an impact on free-ranging sloth populations and wheth- er contact with domestic animals is a factor associated with seroconversion. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus Six viral species were described within the VEE complex (Go et al. 2014), and multiple variants were described within VEEV, among which subtypes 1AB and 1C are involved in equine epizootic outbreaks (Kinney et al. 1992). Bradypus and Choloepus spp. indi- viduals with antibody to VEEV have been described in Panama (Grayson and Galindo 1969; Seymour 1985). Following experimen- tal infection, BTSs develop high titers, similar to rodents, which are considered the most important enzootic hosts (Carrara et al. 2007), and their viremias last 5–6 times longer than in Choloepus spp. Seymour (1985) suggested that BTSs could be an amplifying host for VEEV (Seymour 1985). In South America, reservoir and amplifying hosts in the VEEV enzootic cycle are unknown but may include rodents and birds (Arrigo et al. 2010; Go et al. 2014). In 2007, two of three BTSs collected at the Upala plantation had antibody to VEEV-IE. One of these sloths also had a low titer for both VEEV-IAB and VEEV-II. Considering the higher titer for subtype IE, the lower titers for subtype IAB and subtype II were most likely due to cross-reactivity of the antibody responses or to the different serologic test (PRNT versus HI). A similar observation was made on one of the four positive HTSs. The VEEV antibody prevalence did not change significantly between 2006 and 2007 at Finmac, suggesting an enzootic virus or long lasting immunity. It was not possible to evaluate this hypothesis at the individual level as no sloth captured in multiple years was VEEV antibody positive. MEDLIN ET AL.—PATHOGENS IN FREE-RANGING SLOTHS IN COSTA RICA 889 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis Changuinola virus We found that 30% of HTSs had antibody to CGLV, with prevalences of 46% and 32% in 2005 and 2006 respectively, versus 0% in BTSs. This was similar to the findings of Seymour et al. (1983c) of 42.4% Choloepus spp. and 5.2% Bradypus spp. Changuinola virus antibody prevalence in Panama. This prevalence sup- ports the theory that the primary hosts for this virus are Choloepus spp. sloths. Ilheus virus We found 67% of sloths had antibody to ILHV compared to 2% in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b) and 4% in Brazil (Woodall 1967). These differences could be due to different serologic assays, locations, or years. In our study, individual animals’ titers to ILHV antibody were always higher than the ILHV antibody titer using the same samples. In addition, of the 73 samples positive for ILHV antibody, all were also positive for SLEV antibody, in lower titers (�4), suggesting that HI and CF results may cross-react for SLEV. A cross-reaction between SLEV and ILHV antibodies via HI and CF would also explain that more HTSs than BTSs had detectable antibody to both viruses. St. Louis encephalitis virus Annual prevalence of antibodies to SLEV in sloths in Costa Rica using HI ranged 29–67% in BTSs, and from 78% to 89% in HTSs in our study, which appeared higher than those reported from Choloepus spp. And Bradypus spp. in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). However, when considering PRNT as the most specific serologic technique to detect seroconversion to SLEV, only 53% of the positive samples were considered true posi- tives (46 of 87 positive samples by HI), decreasing the antibody prevalence of to 42%. This result is similar to the prevalence of 46% reported by PRNT in Choloepus spp. in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). For SLEV, our results were consistent with previous studies on antibody prevalences in sloths in Central and South America (Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c; Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al. 2001). In 2005, antibody prevalences were signif- icantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs, similar to findings in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b), whereas prevalences were not significantly different between sloth species during the following years. However, the BTS sample sizes in 2006 and 2007 were relatively small in comparison to 2005, which may have de- creased the power of the statistical analysis and led to a type II error. The implications for public health with respect to the high SLEV antibody prevalence detected in sloths is unknown and warrants further monitoring. In previous studies, no flaviviruses were isolated in Vero cells from 59 sloths (Seymour et al. 1983b, c). This could result from sloths having been exposed, but not viremic at the time of sampling, and thus may not represent a source of SLEV transmission (Seymour et al. 1983b, c). West Nile virus Our study was performed during the first few years after WNV reached South America (Travis 2008). It was therefore relevant to follow the progression of the number of antibody-positive sloths and the titers of those animals. Although WNV infection has been documented extensively in a wide variety of mammals (Travis 2008), including horses in Costa Rica (Hobson-Peters et al. 2011), antibody prevalence had not been evaluated in sloths. The prevalence of antibody to WNV in our study population of HTSs increased significantly from 2005 to 2006. Serologic tests for antibodies to other viruses included in this study were consistent- ly negative in these sloth populations. This lack of seroconversion may reflect lack of exposure, resistance to infection, the limited number of individuals sampled, or high case fatality associated with these viruses in sloths. Regardless, we have evaluated exposure of Costa Rican sloths to 16 arboviruses and have now documented seroconversion to VSV and RGV in sloths. Rio Grande virus infection has possible implications for livestock and human 890 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 52, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2016 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis health. More studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these viruses on free-ranging sloth populations and whether sloths could be incidentally exposed to VSV due to anthropo- genic activities involving livestock. Limitations of this study include the variability associated with viral testing across several years, and lack of serologic assay validation in the two sloth species; hence, the sensitivity and specificity are unknown. For example, cross-reactions between SLEV neutralizing antibodies and ILHV have been previously described in one BTS (Seymour et al. 1983a). Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution, and further investi- gations are needed to confirm our findings. Further studies using PCR and viral culture are needed to document the actual presence of these infectious agents, and are required to investigate the role of sloths in arboviral sylvatic cycles.

Mehla-2009-Recent ancestry of Kyasanur Forest.pdf	Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is enzootic to In- dia and maintained in ticks, mammals, and birds. It causes severe febrile illness in humans and was first recognized in 1957 associated with a high number of deaths among monkeys in Kyasanur Forest. Genetic analysis of 48 virus- es isolated in India during 1957–2006 showed low diversity (1.2%). Bayesian coalescence analysis of these sequences and those of KFDVs from Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China estimated that KFDVs have evolved at a mean rate of ≈6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year, which is similar to rates estimated for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. KFDVs were estimated to have shared a common ancestor in ≈1942, fifteen years before identification of the disease in India. These data are consistent with the view that KFD rep- resented a newly emerged disease when first recognized. Recent common ancestry of KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia, despite their large geographic separation, indicates long-range movement of virus, possibly by birds. Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a member of the mammalian tick-borne virus group (previously re- ferred to as the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup) of the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus (1). In addition to KFDV, this group contains Louping ill, tick-borne enceph- alitis, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Langat, Powassan, Royal Farm, and Gadgets Gully viruses. KFD was first recog- nized in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Shimoga District, Karnataka State, India, when a disease causing a high num- ber of deaths was observed in 2 species of monkeys: the black-faced langur (Semnopithecus entellus, earlier known as Presbytis entellus) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata). Human cases were also found among persons who visited forests to collect firewood, grass, and other forest products. Human disease is characterized by an incubation period of ≈3–8 days, followed by chills, frontal headache, body ache, and high fever for 5–12 days, and a case-fatality rate >30% (2). During infection by KFDV, virus titer re- mains high <10 days after onset of symptoms, as reported by Bhat et al. (3). However, Upadhyaya et al. (4) found that viremia in patients lasted for 12–13 days of illness and unlike most other flaviviruses, remains high during the first 3–6 days with titers as high as 3.1 × 106 PFU/mL. Continuing deaths in monkeys and an average of 400–500 human cases have been seen annually over the past 5 decades, commonly occurring in evergreen, semi- evergreen, and neighboring, moist, deciduous forest areas. An array of tick species, mainly Haemaphysalis spinigera, act as vectors for KFDV (5). This species of tick is widely distributed in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests of southern and central India and Sri Lanka. KFDV has also been isolated from 7 other species of this genus and from Dermacentor and Ixodes ticks. This disease is transmitted by ticks among ground birds and small mammals such as the white-tailed rat, white-bellied rat, shrew, and bat. High titers of virus can be obtained after experimental infection of black-napped hares, porcupines, flying squirrels, Ma- labar giant squirrels, three-striped squirrels, gerbils, mice, long-tailed tree mice, and shrews (2–9). Until 1971, KFDV was endemic to the Sagar, Sorab, and Shikaripur taluks (counties) of Shimoga District (Fig- ure 1). By 1972, a new focus of virus activity appeared in Sirsi Taluk, Uttara Kannada District. Many KFDV isolates were obtained from Karnataka during 1957–1972 and main- tained in a repository at the National Institute of Virology Recent Ancestry of Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus Rajeev Mehla, Sandeep R.P.

However, the virus was found to be highly infectious, as shown by numerous infections in field and laboratory personnel (2,10), which resulted in suspen- sion of work with this virus until an appropriate BioSafety Level-3 laboratory was built at NIV in 2004. In 2006, this laboratory isolated a virus from a serum sample of a patient suspected of having KFD that was obtained from the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory in Shimoga. More recent studies have identified KFDV in Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China (11,12). Dur- ing 1994–1995, a virus was isolated from hemorrhagic fever patients in the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia and identified as a KFDV variant, referred to as the Alkhurma variant or subgroup (11,13,14). The prototype strain of KFDV from Saudi Arabia (strain 1176, isolated in 1995) and the KFDV reference strain from India (P-9605, iso- lated in 1957) differ from each another by only 8% at the genome nucleotide level, despite their temporal (38 years) and geographic (≈4,000 km) separation. A virus initially referred to as Nanjianyin virus, isolated in 1989 from a fe- brile patient in Nanjian County in the Hengduan Mountain region of Yunnan Province in southwestern China, was re- cently identified as a strain of KFDV (12). However, it is unclear whether this KFDV 1989 isolate from China is an authentic virus isolate because it is virtually identical at the nucleotide level with the 1957 reference strain from India (P-9605), despite their being isolated 32 years and almost 3,000 km apart. The P-9605 strain was distributed widely to arbovirus reference laboratories. Reference KFDV vi- rus was used as part of the analysis of serum samples from Yunnan Province (15,16). Results of molecular epidemiologic studies have sug- gested that tick-borne flaviviruses have evolved slowly while dispersing north and west across Asian and European forests during the past few millennia (17–19). This pattern is different from that of rapidly evolving mosquito-borne flaviviruses, many of which can be transported long dis- tances by migratory birds, persons, animals, or mosquito eggs (19,20). We examined the diversity and evolution of KFDV and present data that indicated that KFDV iso- lates from India, Saudi Arabia, and China share a recent common ancestor, indicating long-range movement of this tick-borne flavivirus. In addition, we also estimated the evolution rate of KFDV and compared it with that of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Methods Virus Selection and Reverse Transcription–PCR Forty-seven representative KFDV isolates from In- dia were chosen for analysis; these isolates were obtained during 1957–1972 (Table 1). Isolates represented viruses from various host species and different geographic loca- tions in Shimoga, Uttara Kannada, and Dakshina Kannada districts, Karnataka State. One KFDV from India isolated in 2006 was also included. Lyophilized KFDV stocks were obtained from the virus repository at the NIV, India, and grown in Vero E6 cell lines. Primers for PCR and phyloge- netic analysis were designed to target regions of structural genes (premembrane/envelope) and the nonstructural pro- tein 5 (NS5) gene (viral polymerase) (Table 2). Total RNA was extracted from 250 µL of infected Vero cell lysates by using Trizol reagent (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was dissolved in 50 µL of nuclease-free water. cDNA was prepared separately for structural genes and NS5 by using avian Moloney virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, 10 pM of each gene-specific reverse primer (ER2 and R4 were used for each set of the reverse transcription reactions, respectively) and incubated at 42°C for 45 min and then 85°C for 5 min. cDNA was amplified by using 1U of Taq DNA Poly- merase, 10× PCR buffer (Invitrogen. Carslbad, CA, USA), 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10.0 pM of each primer pair as described in Table 2 in a reaction volume of 25 µL. PCR conditions included denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 1-min steps at 94°C, 55°C, and 72°C; and a 5-min extension at 72°C. Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of interest 1432 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 Figure 1.

EU293242–EU293289 and EU293290–EU293337, respectively). Multiple se- quence alignments were generated by using the MAFFT function (21) in SeaView (22). Nucleotide and amino acid proportional distances were calculated and compared for each virus with their respective date of isolation. A partition homogeneity test (23) was conducted by using PAUP* 4.0b10 (24) to demonstrate that it was not in- appropriate to analyze the 720-nt structural gene fragment and 620-nt NS5 gene fragment as a colinearized or con- catenated single sequence. Phylogenetic analysis was per- formed on the colinearized sequence from each of the 48 KFDV isolates from India (Table 1) along with the corre- sponding gene regions available in GenBank for additional KFDVs: a1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from China (EU918174, NS5 and EU918175, polyprotein) and 2 KFDVs from Saudi Arabia isolated in 1995 (AF331718) and 2004 (DQ154114). The Modeltest 3.7 software program (25) was used to examine 56 models of nucleotide substitution to determine the model most appropriate for Bayesian coalescent analy- sis of the KFDV dataset. The general time reversible evolu- tionary model incorporating invariant sites (GTR + I) was found to be the best fit to the data according to the Akaike information criterion. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted by using BEAST, BEAUTi, and Tracer analysis software (26) with the GTR + I model. Preliminary analy- ses were run for 10,000,000 generations to select the clock and demographic models most appropriate for the KFDV dataset. An analysis of the marginal likelihoods indicated that the relaxed lognormal molecular clock and constant population size model was decisively chosen (log10 Bayes factors of 3.113) for the KFDV dataset. Final data analy- sis included a Markov chain Monte Carlo chain length of 50,000,000 generations with sampling every 1,000 states. Results Comparison of nucleotide sequences of colinear- ized fragments of structural (720 nt) and NS5 (620 nt) genes of 48 KFDV isolates from India collected over the past 5 decades (Table 1) showed a low level of diversity among these viruses (GenBank accession nos. EU29242– EU29337). A maximum of 1.2% nt and 0.5% aa differ- ences were seen among these viruses; the most divergent virus was the A106 virus isolated in 2006. Most viruses were isolated during 1957–1972. That the 2006 virus iso- late is the most divergent is consistent with the 34-year gap in sampling. As expected, little diversity was seen among the virus isolates irrespective of the host, which included humans, black-faced langurs, red-faced bonnet monkeys, various tick species (H. spinigera, H. kyasanurensis, H. turturis, H. papuana kinneari, H. wellingtoni, H. formo- sensis, and Ixodes petauristae), and rodents (Rattus rattus wroghtoni and R. blanfordi) (Table 1). The sequence of the 1957 KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and strain 651521 isolated from an NIV laboratory staff member in 1965 were identical, despite their 8-year separation. How- ever, the staff member was accidently infected while han- dling reference KFDV, which provided an explanation for this anomaly. All KFDV isolates from India differed from the Alkhurma variant of KFDV (27) found in Saudi Arabia by ≈8%–9% at the nucleotide level. This finding is similar to the extent of diversity (8%) reported in a comparison of the complete genome of a KFDV isolate from India with that of an isolate from Saudi Arabia (28). In contrast, the 1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from China (12), differed by only 1 nt (1/1,320 [0.08%]) from the 1957 KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and the labo- ratory infection strain 651521. It is notable that of the 48 KFDV strains from India analyzed, the KFDV strain from China should be most similar to strain P9605, a reference strain that was distributed worldwide to arbovirus refer- ence laboratories. The KFDV 1989 isolate from China is virtually identical at the nucleotide level to the 1957 ref- erence strain (P9605) from India, despite their being iso- lated 32 years and almost 3,000 km apart, which suggests that the strain from China is not an authentic virus isolate. A reference KFDV from India appears to have been used in the analysis of serum samples from Yunnan Province (15,16), which suggests a potential source of laboratory cross-contamination.

Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (EU918174 for NS5 and EU918175 for the polyprotein) of the KFDV isolate reportedly from China appear to contain several sequence analysis errors; neither fragment encodes a functional protein because of creation of a stop codon and 2 frame shifts relative to KFDV reference sequences (AY323490 and EU480689). Bayesian coalescent analysis of sequence differences among the 48 KFDV isolates from India (1957–2006), the isolates from Saudi Arabia (1995–2004) (28,29), and the reported isolate from China (1989) (12) was conducted to estimate the rate of evolution and time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for these viruses (Figure 2). These viruses were estimated to be evolving at a mean rate of 6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year (95% highest probable density [HPD] 4.1–8.8 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year). This estimate is similar to rates for other flaviviruses analyzed by using similar Bayesian coalescent methods, including a rate of 2.17 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year obtained for 23 St. Louis encephalitis viruses collected during 1933–2001 (30) and a rate of 4.2 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year for yellow fever virus (31). The finding of similar evolutionary rates for tick-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses was unex- pected, given earlier assertions that evolution of tick-borne viruses was more gradual than rapidly evolving mosquito- borne viruses (19). Analysis estimated that the mean time to the MRCA for all the KFDV isolates was only 64 years (95% HPD 51– 84 years) before 2006 (the year when the most contempo- rary virus was isolated). The analysis estimated that these viruses shared a common ancestor as recently as ≈1942. Analysis of only KFDV isolates from India provides a slightly more recent estimate of their MRCA (≈1948), just 9 years before identification of the disease in Kyasanur For- est in 1957. This finding correlates well with the perception of local villagers and healthcare providers in the Kyasa- nur Forest area that this was a newly emerged disease (32). Massive deaths of monkeys or compatible human disease in the region were not reported before the 1957 disease out- break. In the initial years, disease activity was reported in a limited area of ≈100 km2 in Sagar and Sorab taluks of Shimoga District. However, after 1972, epizootics and epi- demics were recognized in several new foci, increasingly more distant from the original focus. Discussion Most viruses analyzed were isolated in various small hamlets from migrating persons within the early enzoot- ic zone in the Shimoga District (until 1972). Attempts to examine the relationship between genetic differences in a virus isolate relative to geographic location did not show any notable findings because of small differences and dis- tances involved. However, the 1972 virus 72166 was iso- lated from a tick in the village of Gadgeri in Sirsi (Uttara Kannada District), which is north of Shimoga District. The 2006 virus A106 was isolated from a person south of Shi- moga District, in Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada District) and further from the original virus epicenter (Figure 1). Although much of the topology of the virus phylogenetic tree generated by Bayesian coalescent analysis is poorly supported (nodal support posterior probability values <95), there is support for a branch that contains the 72166 1972 and the A106 2006 virus isolates (Figure 2). These data suggest that there may be an association between virus ge- netic divergence and temporal and geographic spread of KFDV in Karnataka, consistent with the concept of virus spreading over time from an initial focus of activity. Why this initial focus of virus activity occurred in this location and at this time remains unclear, but speculation includes emergence of the virus from a cryptic forest cycle caused by Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009 1435 0.02 G27678 (H. spinigera/Koppalgadde/1959) 67965 (Human/Sagar/1967) P21092 (Human/Hadapsar/1959) 692156 (H. spinigera/Chikkanallur/1969) 601203 (Human/Tudikoppa/1960) 623969 (Human/lab infection/1969) 601011 (Human/Chikkasakuna/1960) 642034 (H. turturis/1964) 612057 (Rattus rattus wroughtoni/Barur/1961) 652980 (Haemaphysalis spp./Vadnala/1965) 652 (H. wellingtoni/Kangodu/1965) 68142 (P. entellus/Holagalale/1968) 651521 (Human/lab infection/1965) 68484 (R. blanfordi/Holagalale/1968) 62844 (H. spinigera/Hillemarur/1962) 6616 (P. entellus/Yelagalale/1966) 681960 (Human/Barur/1968) 712419 (H. spinigera/Nodahalli/1971) 64350 (H. formosensis/Marasa/1964) 1176 (Human/Jeddah, Saudi Arabia/1995) 62849 (R. r. wroughtoni/Hillemarur/1962) 62957 (Human/Hillemarur/1962) 673514 (H. p. kinneari/Siravala/1967) W6178 (P. entellus/Koppalgadde/1959) A106 (Human/Mangalore/2006) 664518 (H. turturis/Kondagalale/1966) W379 (Presbytis entellus/Baragi/1957) G11333 (H. spinigera/Barasi/1957) W1930 (P. entellus/Chimnoor/1958) Nanjianyin (Human/Nanjian County, Yunnan Province, China/1989) 716810 (H. spinigera/Gunjur/1971) 692163 (Human/Thonagodu/1969) 68159 (H. turturis/Siravala/1967) P16011 (Human/Kaisodi/1959) JE7 (Ornithodoros savignyi/ Jeddah, Saudi Arabia/2004) 611661 (Haemaphysalis turturis/Sagar/1961) P9605 (Human/Shigga/1957, Vaccine strain) 63661 (Human/Malavei/1963) W3399 (P. entellus/Hessare/1958) 64244 (Ixodes petauristae/Balagodu/1964) 66364 (Human/Sagar/1966) P20924 (Human/Mullukere/1959) 671004 (P. entellus/Bhadrapura/1967) 7282 (P. entellus/Hollekoppa/1972) W6204 (P. entellus/Kannahalli/1959) W6043 (P. entellus/Belisiri/1959) 72166 (H. kyasanurensis/Gadgeri/1972) 63696 (P. entellus/Suranagadde/1963) G27667 (H. spinigera on dead monkey/Kunvallhai/1959) 642046 (H. p. kinneari/Kangodu/1964) 66928 (Human/Sagar/1966) 1.00 1969 0.86 1977 0.96 1956 1.00 1958 1.00 1942 1.00 1992 Figure 2. Bayesian coalescent analysis of sequence differences of Kyasanur Forest disease virus isolates from India (1957–2006), People’s Republic of China (1989), and Saudi Arabia (1995–2004).

A more complete picture should emerge with analysis of additional virus samples (particularly from the post-1973 period) and complete virus genomes. Bayesian analysis estimates that the 1995 and 2004 KFDV isolates from Saudi Arabia shared a common an- cestor in 1992. The node connecting these viruses with the 2006 KFDV isolate from India was in 1977, and a strongly supported node (1.0) shows that the 1972 and 2006 KFDV isolates from India shared a common ancestor with the viruses from Saudi Arabia in ≈1969. The simplest inter- pretation of these data and the epidemiologic observations would be that KFDV was introduced from India into Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s or the 1980s. Similar findings of low genetic diversity and recent common ancestry were reported for the KFDVs from Saudi Arabia in a more limited study of 11 virus isolates collected over a 5-year period (1994–1999). Only 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.9% genetic diversity were found in the E, NS3, and NS5 gene fragments of these isolates, respectively (27). Using these gene fragments along with those of the complete ge- nome sequence of KFDV from India, the authors estimated divergence time by using an older method based on dis- tance analysis of nonsynonymous substitutions. This esti- mate indicated recent ancestry of these viruses. The KFDV strains from Saudi Arabia were estimated to have diverged from one another over a 4–72 year period and the KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia were estimated to have di- verged 66–177 years ago (27). It is unclear what factors influenced the apparent emer- gence of KFDV in Shimoga District, India, in 1957 and in the Makkah/Jeddah region in Saudi Arabia in 1994. Also unknown is how this tick-borne virus moved over the large distance between these regions. A considerable amount of knowledge has been accumulated with regard to the ecol- ogy of KFDV in India (32). The natural history of the virus is complex and involves dynamic cycles of various life stages of Ixodid ticks (primarily H. spinigera, but also other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks and Ixodes ticks) and am- plifying (vertebrate) hosts, including rodents and shrews, and possibly monkeys and cattle. Increased human popula- tions in the Sagar and Sorab taluks in the early 1950s may have been the primary catalyst for emergence of KFD in 1957. During 1951–1961, the population of Sagar Taluk increased 116%, bringing with it increases in deforestation, cattle grazing, and extension of paddy fields and cleared grazing areas deeper into previously forested areas (32). Expansion of the cattle population may have been a cru- cial factor because cattle harbor adult forms of H. spinigera ticks, and an association between cattle and increases in tick larval density has been described (32). Cattle also carry all life stages of other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, which have been shown to be infected with KFDV. Thus, cattle would likely increase tick densities in cleared forest areas most frequented by humans. In addition, rats, shrews, and mice are highly susceptible to KFDV infection, and numerous virus isolates have been obtained from organs of infected animals (33). Changes in land use and population densities may have resulted in emergence of KFDV from a cryptic enzootic cycle in this previously heavily forested area. A high percentage of birds in the affected area are pos- itive for antibodies reactive with KFDV and infested with Haemaphysalis spp. and other tick genera, particularly lar- vae and nymphs (32). It is unclear whether birds play a role in the complex virus maintenance cycle in an enzootic zone, but birds carrying virus-infected ticks or migration of viremic birds could spread KFDV over large distances such as those separating areas of KFDV activity in India and Saudi Arabia (19,34). There is serologic evidence of KFDV, or a related flavivirus in the mammalian tick-borne virus group, in Saurashtra, Gujarat State, on the coast of India on the Arabian Sea and in birds captured outside Kar- nataka State (2,10,32). The current known distribution of KFDV is limited to relatively restricted areas of India and Saudi Arabia. However, it is likely that the virus exists in other areas in cryptic enzootic cycles or is associated with unrecog- nized or undiagnosed disease. This finding, together with the distance separating the KFDV-affected areas in India and Saudi Arabia, despite their relatively recent common ancestry, suggests that KFD has the potential to flare up in other regions because of virus movement or ecologic changes in the area. Clinicians should consider KFD in a differential diagnosis when considering acute febrile cases with compatible symptoms in other regions of Asia and the Middle East.

In general, specialists are more prone to extinction than generalists and, thus, are often the first species to be lost when habitats are modified. The two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) are arboreal herbivores distributed across the Neotropics. The two-toed sloth is considered a generalist while the three-toed sloth is more specialized. Both species inhabit shade-grown agro-ecosystems but, at least at one study site, only the two-toed sloth was viable. To quantify specialization in sloth species and explore how it influences population viability, we characterized the resource use for 68 adult and 12 subadult sloths across 3 y. The two-toed sloth used 14 tree species relatively uniformly across habitats, while the three-toed sloth largely depended on only two species of tree regardless of habitat type. Both species selected for patches of intact tropical forest, strongly avoided monocultures regardless of spatial scale and generally used cocoa similarly in proportion to availability. However, the sloth species differed in their use of cattle pastures, with the two-toed sloth selecting for pastures and the three-toed sloth avoiding them. Overall, the two-toed sloth exhibited greater plasticity in tree and habitat use, which is likely contributing to its enhanced resilience within this modified agro-ecosystem. Key Words: Costa Rica, farm, Neotropics, Xenarthra INTRODUCTION Resource use and overlap plays a central role in the structuring of vertebrate communities. The mechanisms by which organisms partition resources typically involve differentiation in some combination of habitat use (at both fine and coarse scales), timing of activity and diet. Differences in niche-breadth among competing species are ultimately the result of an evolutionary trade-off between the ability to exploit a wide base of resources and the efficient use of each one (Futuyma & Moreno 1988, MacArthur 1972). Although species occur along a continuum of niche breadth, they are often considered simply as specialists or generalists (Clavel et al. 2010, Julliard et al. 2006). These two resource acquisition strategies have been associated with important life- 1 Corresponding author. Email: jnpauli@wisc.edu history traits: in general, specialists have lower dispersal capacities (Brouat et al. 2004), and are more susceptible to stochasticity and environmental change (Clavel et al. 2010, Sol et al. 2002) than generalists. As a consequence, resource specialists are typically more prone to extinction than generalists, and often the first species to be lost when habitats are modified (Boyles & Storm 2007, Dunn et al. 2009, Laurance 1991). Sloths are mid-sized (2.0–4.5 kg) arboreal mammals that spend the majority of their time in forest canopies. The two phylogenetic groups of sloth, two- (Choloepus spp.) and three-toed sloths (Bradypus spp.), diverged roughly 18–40 Mya (Delsuc et al. 2001, Gaudin 2004), co- occur across much of their distributional range and are ecologically quite different (Pauli et al. 2014). Although both are arboreal folivores, previous authors have broadly described the two-toed sloth as a generalist, inhabiting a range of habitat types and consuming leaves from a number of species as well as augmenting their diet with https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

MENDOZA ET AL. non-leaf items (e.g. fruits, flowers and animal matter) and possessing large home ranges; the three-toed sloth is considered more specialized, foraging on only leaves from a small number of tree species to the point that individuals appear capable of surviving on a single or a few tree species (Chiarello 2008, Gilmore et al. 2001, Montgomery & Sunquist 1975, 1978; Pauli et al. 2014). Both two- and three-toed sloths use shade-grown agro-ecosystems (Vaughan et al. 2007) but in one well-studied system, only the two-toed sloth appears capable of maintaining self-sustaining populations in such habitats, while the three-toed sloth is only viable in the face of immigration from surrounding areas (Peery & Pauli 2014). Herein, we determined resource use and overlap for syntopic populations of two- (C. hoffmanni) and three- toed sloth (B. variegatus) in the same shade-grown agro-ecosystem where viability analyses were conducted (Peery & Pauli 2014) to explore whether greater habitat and resource specialization by the three-toed sloth could be contributing to its relatively low viability in this altered landscape (Peery & Pauli 2014). Specifically, we quantified tree use and macro-habitat selection for both two- and three-toed sloths across a range of different habitats present within the agro-ecosystem. We predicted that diversity of tree species used would be greatest in tropical forests, intermediate in shade-grown cocoa, and lowest in pasture for both species and that the three-toed sloth would exhibit stronger selection for patches of intact forest and greater avoidance of cattle pastures than the two-toed sloth. METHODS Study area Fieldwork was conducted in and around a privately owned organic shade-grown cocoa (Theobroma cacao) farm, in north-eastern Costa Rica (10.32°N, 83.59°W; Figure 1). The region possesses a wet and warm climate featuring a rainy season from mid- or late-April to January, which is briefly interrupted by a dry period in August or September (Holdridge 1967, Janzen 1983). The study area occurs within an agricultural landscape that contains five habitat types: (1) cocoa trees grown under overstorey of native and non-native trees, (2) tropical forest occurring in narrow (�20 m) riparian buffers and small patches, (3) cattle pastures with scattered trees, (4) monocultures of cultivated crops, and (5) human development (i.e. housing) that border the study area. We used 2013 RapidEye satellite imagery (IntraSearch Inc.) with 5-m resolution and five-band multispectral imagery to visually digitize polygons representing these habitat types using ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Animal captures For this study we captured adult two-toed (n = 36) and three-toed sloths (n = 32), and subadult sloths (n = 4; n = 8, respectively) by hand from trees from February 2010 to January 2013. Captured individuals were classified as subadults or adults based on body mass described by Peery & Pauli (2014). Each individual was marked with uniquely coded PIT tags (Biomark, Boise, ID) inserted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades. Additionally, adult males of adequate size were fitted with radio-collars (Mod-210, Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA) to track their movement, and adult females were fitted with uniquely identifiable colour collars. All sloths were relocated every 1–10 d (with a minimum of 24 h between relocations) and the majority (98%) of all sloth relocations occurred during daylight hours. Tree use We classified tree use based on the tree species occupied by an individual at the time of relocation and proportion of species used was calculated for each sloth. Tree species were identified with aid of Zuchowski (2007) and following the nomenclature of Hammel et al. (2003). We used a likelihood ratio test for goodness-of-fit to compare tree use between the two sloth species. Using these data, we also characterized the diversity of tree species used by each individual and by all individuals pooled for each species with Simpson’s index of diversity. Habitat selection We characterized second- and third-order habitat selection to identify habitat characteristics preferred by the two- and the three-toed sloth (Johnson 1980). Second- order habitat selection reflects the habitat features that individuals use to select the location of their home range, whereas third-order selection reflects the habitat features that individuals preferentially use within their home range. For this analysis, we only included individuals that had a minimum of 16 relocations and that were not dispersing from their home range. We estimated home ranges using 90% fixed kernel methods for 34 adult resident two-toed sloths (median = 64 relocations; range: 16–179) and 33 (n = 30 adults; n = 3 subadults) three-toed sloths (median = 50 relocations; range = 20– 212). Home ranges were delineated using ESRI’s ArcGIS 10.1 and the Geospatial Modelling Environment with least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) as the smoothing parameter (Millspaugh & Marzluff 2001). To evaluate second-order habitat selection, we considered used habitat as the proportion of each habitat type in each https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

We treated available habitat as the proportion of each habitat type within the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) of all sloths relocations of a given species (i.e. pooled across individuals). Within the MCP, we calculated available habitat in two different ways: (1) as the proportion of all five habitats (cocoa, tropical forest, pastures, monocultures and human development) and (2) excluding the least-used habitats (monocultures and human development). Monocultures and human development habitats were excluded from the second analysis as sloths are predominantly observed in cocoa, tropical forest and cattle pastures, and rarely utilize monocultures or human development (Vaughan et al. 2007). To test for third-order habitat selection, we considered used habitat to be the proportion of relocations that occurred in each habitat.

We used Manly’s Alpha preference index to test for habitat selection at both levels across all individuals (Manly et al. 2002). We inferred selection for a particular habitat type if the observed index exceeded the expected value and did not overlap in the 95% CI. Conversely, we inferred that sloths avoided a habitat type if the observed index was less than the expected values and did not overlap in the 95% CI. RESULTS Tree use The three-toed sloth heavily utilized only two species – Cecropia obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa – while the two- toed sloth frequented Inga vera slightly more than the other 14 tree species (Figure 2a, b). The difference in tree use was significantly different between the two species Table 1.

Tree-species use differed by habitat type for the three most commonly used habitats (forest, cocoa and pasture) in both three- toed sloth (χ2 = 515, df = 18, P < 0.001) and two-toed sloth (χ2 = 714, df = 28, P < 0.001). The two-toed sloth utilized a greater diversity of trees than the three-toed sloth at both the individual- (t78 = 2.98, P = 0.004) and population-level (Table 1). The diversity of trees used by the two-toed sloth was also higher within cocoa compared with the three-toed sloth at the individual (t78 = 5.65, P < 0.001), and population level (Table 1). Habitat selection The most abundant habitat types within our study area were cocoa, pastures and monocultures, while tropical forest and human development were the least abundant (Table 2). Median home range size was 7.5 ha (range = 0.6–101.1 ha) and 5.3 ha (range = 0.1–53.3 ha) for the two- and the three-toed sloth, respectively. Both species of sloth exhibited second-order habitat selection for tropical forests and avoided monocultures and human development (Figure 3a). However, the two- toed sloth also selected pastures, while the three-toed sloth avoided this habitat type. When we excluded rarely used monocultures and human development from our analyses, the two-toed sloth selected for tropical forest but avoided cocoa; the three-toed sloth selected for tropical forest, and avoided both cocoa and pastures (Figure 3b). Within home ranges (i.e. third-order habitat selection) both the two- and the three-toed sloth selected for tropical forest (Figure 3c), while the three-toed sloth avoided cocoa and strongly avoided pastures (Figure 3c). DISCUSSION As predicted, the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity of tree species and was more plastic in its use of habitats at multiple spatial scales. In contrast, the three- toed sloth exhibited a strong dependence on intact tropical forest and on only two species of tree (Cecropia https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Per cent of habitat type available at our study site in north-eastern Costa Rica, and within the home range of two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus).

Interestingly, these two tree species were the least used by the two-toed sloth, perhaps a strategy used to avoid interspecific competition. Differences in tree use for the two sloth species appear to depend on the ability of each species to adapt to human modifications; for example, the two-toed sloth generally used the non-native species Erythrina poeppigiana in pastures, while we did not observe any three-toed sloths using this tree species. Overall, the diversity of tree use was somewhat dependent on habitat type, and was similar for both sloth species in riparian forests and pastures, which could be due to the differential availability of trees in the two habitats. On one hand, the richness of trees within intact tropical rain forests is highest and sloths of both species have access to a great number of different tree species. On the other hand, the paucity of tree species within pastures limits the diversity of tree use for both species of sloth. In the habitat where we observed a difference in the diversity of tree use – shade-grown cocoa – the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity of trees compared with the three-toed sloth. This difference is likely due to limited availability of trees preferred by three-toed sloths, especially the scarcity of secondary trees like Nectandra salicifolia and Ocotea sinuata, leading to particularly strong dependence on Cecropia obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa in shade-grown cocoa (pers. obs). Both species of sloth selected intact tropical forests, exhibited neutrality or slight avoidance of shade- grown cocoa, and strongly avoided monocultures and human development. These findings are not particularly surprising, as previous researchers have shown that sloths are largely intolerant of monocultures, and select for habitats with structural complexity and intact forest canopies (Rolim & Chiarello 2004, Vaughan et al. 2007). The neutrality or avoidance (depending on scale and how rarely used habitats were treated) towards shade-grown cocoa was expected for the three-toed sloth but not for the two-toed sloth, especially since the two-toed sloth is frequently observed in cocoa. Vaughan et al. (2007) suggested that the three-toed sloth uses shade-grown cocoa in proportion to its availability whereas the two- toed sloth uses it less than expected. A factor that may explain differences of our results from previous studies is that Vaughan et al. (2007), quantified living fences (in and around the shade-grown cocoa) as a discrete habitat type, and found sloths selected strongly for the fencerows and avoided the cocoa. We choose to pool cocoa and living fences into a more generalized shade-grown cover type to minimize potential GPS and remote sensing error, especially since living fences are extraordinarily narrow (i.e. 1–5 m), and because we believe that fencerows are an implicit and important component of shade-grown cocoa (Chacón & Harvey 2006). The two-toed sloth used pastures in proportion to availability within their home range, while the three-toed sloth avoided this habitat; we presume that the three-toed sloth avoids pastures due to the lack of closed canopies and a dearth of suitable tree species. Additionally, the three-toed sloth may avoid pastures to evade the risk of predation by coyote (Canis latrans) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), as this species is more vulnerable to ground predators given its smaller size and more docile behaviour (Peery & Pauli 2014). In contrast, the two-toed sloth may be better adapted to pastures since it possesses greater mobility and is able to move on the ground in between trees (Sunquist & Montgomery 1973). Overall, our findings suggest that the two-toed sloth is flexible in its use of trees and habitat selection compared with the more specialized three-toed sloth. This greater plasticity in two-toed sloth resource use is likely contributing to its enhanced viability within an agro-ecosystem containing shade-grown elements. Conversely, specialization on a few tree species and avoidance of pastures containing isolated trees seems likely to have contributed to the three-toed sloth’s reduced viability in an agro-ecosystem containing only a fraction of the original forest. More broadly, our results indicate that some generalists are more resilient to the conversion of tropical forests to shade-grown agricultural systems than specialists, even in closely related species. Thus, while shade-grown systems, such as those of cocoa or coffee (Coffea spp.), can harbour a greater diversity of animal species across a range of taxa compared with monocultures (Cassano et al. 2011, Clough et al. 2011, Delabie et al. 2007), by themselves they may be insufficient to harbour some resource specialists. Previous studies have shown that the amount of biodiversity retained in shade-grown agro- ecosystems is positively related to tree density, species composition and diversity (Clough et al. 2011, Schroth https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467414000583 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Values above the expected value (horizontal dotted line) indicate preference; values below indicate avoidance. et al. 2004); we suspect that retaining as much of these elements as possible could be particularly beneficial for resource specialists. Moreover, landscape context is likely critical for maintaining sensitive species (Pardini et al. 2009), where the juxtaposition of intact forest to provide a source of immigrants is required to maintaining the full array of species. Our study area, comprised of intact forest, pastures, shade-grown agriculture and monocultures, seems to be a microcosm for much of Costa Rica and Central America (Brown & Lugo 1990, Janzen 1983, Myers 1991, Sader & Joyce 1988) and may provide insight into how different forms of human altered landscapes may favour certain species over others.

Antibody prevalence to WNV was higher (9%) than for the other viruses. Most seropositive birds were adults ($3 yr of age), with 55% of adults testing positive for antibodies to at least one virus. Adults were significantly more likely to have antibodies to WNV than nonadults (P,0.001). Prevalence of SLEV and EEEV antibodies among Crested Caracaras was 3% for each virus, and three adult caracaras had indistinguishable anti-flavivirus antibodies. The susceptibility of Crested Caracaras to adverse effects of WNV, SLEV, or EEEV infection remains unknown; however, we observed that some free-ranging individuals survived infec- tion and successfully fledged young. Knowl- edge of arboviral infection among Florida’s Crested Caracara, which is both state and federally threatened, is valuable considering increasing pressure on this population from rapid and extensive habitat alterations. Key words: Antibody, Crested Caracara, Caracara cheriway, eastern equine encephali- tis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus. Birds are important virus-amplifying hosts for numerous arboviruses (Stamm, 1966), some of which may adversely affect the health of free-ranging birds (McLean and Ubico, 2007). This is a particular concern for state and federally threatened species, such as the Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway, hereafter, caracara; family Falconidae). The caracara is the only caracara species in North America, and a small, isolated population resides in Florida. Numerous arboviruses circulate within the caracara’s Florida range, including West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; both in the family Flavivi- ridae, genus Flavivirus), and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; family Togavi- ridae, Genus Alphavirus) (Day and Stark, 1996; Blackmore et al., 2003). To our knowledge, WNV, SLEV, and EEEV in- fections have not been documented in caracaras. We sampled caracaras in Florida and tested their sera for specific anti-WNV, -SLEV, and -EEEV antibodies to deter- mine antibody prevalence rates and to assess potential age and sex associations with seroprevalence. We sampled caracaras from April 2007 to August 2008. Flighted caracaras were captured via a phai trap (Beebe and Webster, 1964) modified to accommodate carrion as bait; recently fledged birds were caught by hand. Blood (0.2–0.6 ml) was collected from the ulnar vein of each bird, placed into serum separator tubes, and held at ambient temperature for 1–4 hr before transfer to an iced cooler for 1–4 hr. Thereafter, blood was clarified by centrifu- gation (2,250 3 G for 10 min), and sera were stored at 220 C until testing, except when shipped on ice to Colorado State University (Fort Collins, Colorado, USA). Birds were aged based on the coloration of breast feathers; those with breast feathers fully or partially streaked were categorized as ‘‘nonadult’’ (i.e., subadult, juvenile, or fledgling), and birds with fully barred breast feathers were categorized as 817 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use ‘‘adult’’ (Wheeler and Clark, 2003). Non- adult birds were #2 yr old, and adults were $3 yr old (Dwyer, unpubl. data). Sex was determined for each bird through DNA analysis (Avian Biotech Internation- al, Tallahassee, Florida, USA). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), using Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates (Beaty et al., 1995), was used to detect antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and EEEV. Before testing, serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min. Sera were initially tested at a serum dilution of 1:10 in BA-1 medium (M199- Hank’s salts, 1% bovine serum albumin, 350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/ml amphotericin B in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.6). The PRNT challenge dose was approximately 100 plaque-forming units of the following strains: WNV NY99-4132 (originally isolated from crow brain in New York, USA), SLEV TBH-28 (origi- nally isolated from human brain in Tampa, Florida, USA), and EEEV FL93 (original- ly isolated from mosquitoes in Florida). Known anti-WNV and anti-SLEV anti- body-positive chicken sera and anti-EEEV horse serum served as positive controls in the respective neutralization assays. Serum samples with $90% neutraliza- tion at a 1:10 dilution were considered positive for anti-viral antibodies, and positive samples were serially diluted (twofold) to determine reciprocal end- point 90% neutralization (PRNT90) titers. A fourfold or greater titer of either anti- WNV or anti-SLEV antibodies indicated that particular virus as the etiologic agent of infection. Sera from three individuals were positive for antibodies to both SLEV and WNV, but we could not demonstrate a fourfold or greater titer of either WNV or SLEV, so these individuals were consid- ered flavivirus positive. We tested 80 caracaras from 10 counties for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and EEEV. Sampled birds included 58 nonadults (25 juveniles and 33 subadults) and 22 adults, composed of 47 (59%) females and 33 (41%) males. Fisher’s exact test was used to test for differences in antibody preva- lence rates between adults and nonadults. Antibodies to WNV were detected in seven (9%) of the caracaras. Most (55% [12/22]) of the adults were seropositive for at least one arbovirus, whereas 2% (1/58) of nonadults were seropositive (one juve- nile was positive for antibodies to EEEV). Among adults, one (5%) and two individ- uals (9%) were seropositive for EEEV and SLEV, respectively, whereas three adults (14%) had antibodies to flaviviruses that could not be differentiated as either WNV or SLEV (Table 1). One adult had anti- bodies to both SLEV and EEEV. Among adults, 66% (7/11) of females and 46% (5/ 11) of males were positive for antibodies to one or more arboviruses. Serum PRNT90 antibody titers were from 20 to 80, and seropositive caracaras were cap- tured in six counties (Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin; Fig. 1). Adults were significantly more likely to have anti-WNV antibodies than were TABLE 1.

We found no differ- ence in arbovirus seroprevalence by sex in adults (n522, df51, P50.669) or across all ages (n580, df51, P51.000). Similarly, there was no difference in WNV sero- prevalence by sex in adults (n522, df51, P51.000) or across all ages (n580, df51, P51.000). Seven seropositive adults were providing parental care to dependent fledged young when these adults were sampled. We observed feather mites, lice, or both, and superficial abrasions on the faces of some of the birds sampled, but all birds seemed to be in general good health, were flight capable, and were foraging normally when captured. West Nile virus was first detected in Florida in 2001, at which time antibody prevalence among 10 species of free- ranging birds, including passeriforms, columbiforms, and one falconiform (a Red-shouldered Hawk, Buteo lineatus), was 10.5% (n5152) in Jefferson County, Florida, and Lowndes County, Georgia, USA (Godsey et al., 2005). Both SLEV and EEEV were first reported in Florida in 1952; antibody prevalence rates were 1.3% for EEEV and 0.5% for SLEV (n55,295) among free-ranging birds sam- pled from 1965 to 1974 (Bigler and Hoff, 1975; Bigler et al., 1976). Arbovirus seroprevalence rates observed among ca- racaras in south-central Florida in the present study are consistent with these previous studies. West Nile virus has led to unprecedent- ed mortality in native North American FIGURE 1.

Seropositive birds were located in Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin counties. SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 819 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use birds (Marra et al., 2004), whereas fatal EEEV and SLEV infections have been less commonly reported (McLean and Bowen, 1980; Main et al., 1988). Numer- ous raptors, including members of the family Falconidae, are susceptible to WNV infection and disease, although susceptibility varies among species (Joyner et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2007; Nemeth et al., 2009). Serologic surveys of free- ranging raptors in Wisconsin, California, and Pennsylvania in the USA revealed healthy, free-ranging seropositive individ- uals (Stout et al., 2005; Hull et al., 2006; Medica et al., 2007). Raptors are poten- tially exposed to WNV via mosquitoes and oral infection from prey (Nemeth et al., 2006). In our study, caracaras seropositive for WNV, EEEV, SLEV, or a combina- tion, seemed healthy, although individuals that may have died from infection are not accounted for in serologic surveys. Arboviruses are maintained in enzootic cycles between birds and mosquitoes, and exposure of free-ranging animals depends on many factors, including habitat, season, weather, contact rates between vectors and hosts, and host and vector abundance (Stamm, 1966; Day, 2005). Caracaras in Florida primarily inhabit drained grass- land and pasture habitats that are usually adjacent to drainage ditches, where mos- quitoes often are abundant (Morrison and Humphrey, 2001; Diuk-Wasser et al., 2006). Breeding caracaras are nonmigra- tory and live in pairs on defended territories throughout the year. Nonbreed- ing caracaras are vagrant throughout south-central Florida and aggregate at communal roosts that may consist of .200 individuals during the wet season (approximately late May to October; Dwyer et al., unpubl. data). Transmission rates are potentially high within commu- nal roosts, as evidenced in American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in east-central Illinois (Yaremych et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2006). However, we found little evidence of arbovirus infection in caracaras #2 yr of age. Limited evidence for WNV infec- tion in younger birds could be partially explained by apparently low levels of WNV transmission in counties within our study area in recent years (http://diseasemaps. usgs.gov/wnv_historical.html). In addition, longer lived resident animals, such as the Crested Caracaras (Morrison, 2003), may be more likely to encounter an infectious mosquito during their lifetime than either shorter lived animals or animals that migrate to regions where mosquito vectors are inactive for part of the year. In the present study, antibodies to arboviruses were more common in adult caracaras than in younger birds, although the timing of initial infection is unknown. This result is consistent with other studies in which antibody prevalence rates of WNV and other arboviruses were higher among free-ranging adult birds than youn- ger individuals (Garvin et al., 2004; Beveroth et al., 2006). Garvin et al. (2004) hypothesized that young Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) may succumb to EEEV infection and therefore may not be represented in seroprevalence studies, and there is evidence that young birds of some species are more susceptible to WNV-associated morbidity and mortality than older birds (Austin et al., 2004; Nemeth and Bowen, 2007; Nemeth et al., 2008). Both adult and juvenile caraca- ras had relatively high estimated annual survival (89.1 and 69.4%, respectively) before the arrival of WNV to Florida (1994–2000; Morrison, 2003); however, whether infection with WNV or other arboviruses affects survival of this species remains unknown. We demonstrated that some free-rang- ing caracaras survive infection with WNV and other arboviruses with no apparent reductions in fecundity. However, Flor- ida’s population of caracaras faces a variety of challenges, including geographic isola- tion and human-induced alterations of nesting and foraging habitat (Morrison and Humphrey, 2001). Changes in land use may affect caracara behavior, as well as mosquito density and distribution, 820 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 45, NO. 3, JULY 2009 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use potentially leading to increased caracara- vector contact, and therefore more oppor- tunities for arbovirus transmission. Fur- ther studies are warranted to ascertain whether caracaras suffer negative effects from arboviral infection, and particularly WNV.

Both JEV and WNV are naturally transmitted between mos- quito vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts, including birds. A potential route of JEV introduction from Asia to western North America is via the Hawaiian archipelago, while the spread of WNV from mainland North America to Hawai‘i is also considered an impending threat. We surveyed resident, non- native bird sera for antibodies to JEV and WNV on two Hawaiian Islands from 2004–2005. Three of 1,835 birds (0.16%) had evidence of antiflavivirus antibodies, demonstrating neu- tralizing activity to JEV and St. Louis enceph- alitis virus (SLEV). These detections could represent a limited transmission focus of either, or both, JEV and SLEV, or cross-reactive antibodies due to primary infection with an alternate flavivirus. Frequent air traffic from both Asia and North America to Hawai‘i, along with the presence of probable competent vectors and amplifying vertebrate hosts in Hawai‘i, increases the likelihood of introduction and maintenance of novel flaviviruses. There- fore, it is important to monitor for the presence of these viruses. Key words: Bird, Hawai‘i, Japanese en- cephalitis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus. Hawai‘i and other remote islands are particularly vulnerable to the introduction of novel wildlife pathogens because of immunologically naı̈ve vertebrate host populations. Peridomestic mosquitoes were introduced to Hawai‘i with the arrival of European human settlers and, as a result, devastating mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium relictum [avi- an malaria] and Avipoxvirus [avian pox]) decimated native avian populations (La- Pointe, 2007). Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus (JEV and WNV, respectively; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are globally emerging mosqui- to-borne viruses that cause fatal enceph- alitis in humans and other vertebrates and could pose a significant threat to the state of Hawai‘i (Kilpatrick et al., 2004; Mack- enzie et al., 2004). Similar to WNV, JEV is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, with birds as amplifying hosts. It is thought that WNV may have arrived in the United States via an infected mosquito or verte- brate host (Gubler, 2007); similarly, these mechanisms have likely contributed to the geographic spread of JEV (Mackenzie et al., 2004). Because of the risk of introduction of novel arboviruses to Hawai‘i, we screened free-ranging, resident birds for serologic evidence of past infection with several arboviruses within the Japanese encepha- litis serocomplex including JEV, WNV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). Our objective was to determine the serum antibody prevalence of WNV and JEV among birds captured primarily at sites that receive frequent air traffic. We hypothesized that a local transmission focus could initiate if one of these viruses arrived via a viremic human or other vertebrate, or via an infected mosquito associated with air travel. Serologic evi- dence of flavivirus infection among resi- dent birds may be suggestive of local transmission and would help establish baseline antibody prevalence for future research and surveillance efforts. Resident birds were mist-netted year- round from June 2004–December 2005 at various sites on the islands of Oahu 659 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis (Barber’s Point, Dillingham Airfield, Hickam Airfield, Honolulu Airport, Ka- laeloa, and Kewalo; approximately 21uN, 157–158uW) and Maui (Kahului Airport; 20u549N, 156u269W). Blood was collected by venipuncture of the jugular vein (approximately 0.1–0.2 ml) and either left undiluted or diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffered saline with 0.75% bovine serum albumin. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 3 G for 3 min, and sera were aliquotted into separate vials, heat inacti- vated at 56 C for 30 min, and stored at 220 or 280 C. Sera were screened at the Hawai‘i Department of Health Laboratory (HDHL), in Pearl City, Hawai‘i, for anti- WNV antibodies by a blocking enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting an immunodominant WNV epi- tope on the NS1 protein. Prior to estab- lishing the ELISA as part of the WNV testing algorithm at the HDHL in Febru- ary 2005, optimal titers for both antigen and antibody were determined by check- erboard titration. Sera were tested in triplicate at a 1:20 dilution for initial screening, with suspected positives (inhi- bition $50%) also tested at further dilutions (e.g., 1:40 and 1:80). Beginning in February 2005, a blocking ELISA protocol was established according to Hall et al. (1995), using inactivated Kunjin lysate antigen and WNV- specific monoclonal antibodies, with mod- ifications for detection of anti-WNV anti- bodies as described in Jozan et al. (2003). All ELISA positives were considered presumptive until confirmatory testing by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Samples were shipped overnight on ice to Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, where they were screened for anti-JEV antibodies by PRNT (Beaty et al., 1995). For PRNT, sera were tested at a 1:10 dilution in BA-1 medium (Hank’s M- 199 salts, 1% bovine serum albumin, 350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ ml penicillin, 100 mg/l streptomycin, 1 mg/ l Fungizone in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.6) against a challenge dose of approximately 100 plaque-forming units of JEV strain 826309 (isolated from human brain in India). Serum samples that neutralized #70% of JEV were considered negative for anti-JEV antibodies. Samples with .70% neutralization of JEV were retested through a second JEV PRNT for confir- mation of the initial result, and were also screened by PRNT at a 1:10 dilution for antibodies to WNV (using strain NY99- 4132, isolated from crow brain in New York, USA) and SLEV (using strain TBH- 28, isolated from human brain in Florida, USA) with the same criteria of .70% neutralization for a positive result. This 70% neutralization cut-off was selected to reasonably distinguish antiflavivirus anti- body reactivity from clearly seronegative (i.e., ,50% neutralization) samples. A total of 1,835 birds of 11 species were sampled, most of which were nonnative residents of Hawai‘i (Table 1). Serum samples from all birds included in the present study were negative for anti-WNV antibodies as determined by blocking ELISA, along with an additional .10,000 avian serum samples collected in Hawai‘i from January 2006–October 2009. Sera from three birds (0.16%) exhibited flavi- virus neutralizing activity with between 71–94% neutralization of JEV or SLEV. Sera from these three birds were clearly negative for antibodies to WNV by ELISA (,0% inhibition) and by PRNT (,50% neutralization). Sera with JEV- or SLEV- neutralizing activity were collected be- tween June and September 2005 from a Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis) and a Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora) at the Honolulu International Airport and a Spotted Dove at Dillingham Airfield. In two of these birds (Spotted Dove and Java Sparrow), apparent cross-reactive antifla- vivirus antibodies made it difficult to differentiate antibodies specific to JEV versus SLEV (Table 2). Japanese encephalitis virus has been deemed the most important cause of 660 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 46, NO. 2, APRIL 2010 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis epidemic encephalitis worldwide and is the leading recognized cause of childhood encephalitis in Asia (Tsai, 1997; Solomon, 2003). Likewise, WNV is an important cause of arboviral disease in the United States and, since its arrival to New York in 1999, has led to neuro-invasive disease in .11,000 humans and the death of likely millions of birds (Reimann et al., 2008). Because transmission of these viruses involves primarily wild birds and mosqui- toes, as well as pigs for JEV, they are difficult to control and eradicate once established. Therefore, ongoing monitor- ing for these viruses is important, espe- cially in Hawai‘i, where the climate favors year-round arbovirus transmission and, presumably, competent (and naı̈ve) vec- tors and hosts are in abundance. Hawai‘i has been recognized as a potential location for JEV emergence that could facilitate spread from Asia to western North America (Quisenberry and Wallace, 1959). The possibility of intro- duction of SLEV, WNV, JEV, or other zoonotic viruses to Hawai‘i via viremic captive birds or infected mosquitoes is an important consideration in quarantine and other control measures. Accordingly, WNV surveillance has been ongoing in Hawai‘i since November 2004, and em- bargoes and quarantines have been im- plemented to mitigate the threat of WNV introduction (Marra et al., 2004). Quanti- tative analysis suggested that the most likely source for the introduction of WNV to Hawai‘i is a human-transported infected mosquito, or an infectious bird or other vertebrate host (Kilpatrick et al., 2004). Similarly, JEV introduction to the West coast of the United States was deemed most likely to occur via an infected TABLE 1.

While local transmission could initiate following JEV or WNV introduction to Hawai‘i, maintenance or amplification of transmission could subsequently fail due to lack of immediate and sufficient num- bers of competent vectors or hosts. Alternately, flaviviruses that are yet to be detected or identified could occasionally infect birds. For example, ‘‘insect-only’’ flaviviruses have recently been identified in Africa, Asia, and the Americas (re- viewed recently in Cook et al., 2009) and could be immunogenic in some birds. Documented viruses such as Murray Valley encephalitis virus, also a member of the JEV serocomplex that circulates between mosquito vectors and avian hosts in Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Irian Java, may also be capable of unexpected spread (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988). The lack of 100% virus neutralization by sera from flavivirus-positive birds in the present study may suggest a primary infecting virus other than WNV, SLEV, or JEV. We detected a minimal percent- age (,0.2%) of birds with flavivirus- neutralizing antibodies in Hawai‘i from 2004–2005. Low prevalence of antibodies to arboviruses among birds in Hawai‘i, as well as difficulty distinguishing the infec- tive virus, is consistent with previously reported data. In 1959, surveillance for JEV, SLEV, and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses on Oahu revealed five birds (0.66%; n5754), all residents, with evidence of nonspecific virus neutralization (Wallace et al., 1964). In contrast, WNV antibody prevalence among some avian species has been 10– 25% in the southern mainland United States, several years or more after the introduction of WNV (e.g., Louisiana in 2002 [Komar et al., 2005], Georgia in 2004 [Gibbs et al., 2006]). Native Hawaiian birds are potentially vulnerable to disease associated with infection with novel arboviruses (Warner, 1968; Van Riper et al., 1986; LaPointe et al., 2009). However, introduced birds thrive on the Islands, and many of these are likely competent reservoir hosts of WNV and SLEV, such as the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), as well as the native Hawai‘i ‘Amakihi (Hemignathus virens; McLean et al., 1983; Reisen et al., 2001; Komar et al., 2003; LaPointe et al., 2009). Potential JEV reservoirs are also present in Hawai‘i, such as the resident Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax hoactli) and introduced Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), as well as feral swine (Sus scrofa) (Buescher et al., 1959; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004; LaPointe, 2007). In addition, potentially competent mosquito vectors are found in Hawai‘i including Aedes albopictus, Ochlerotatus japonicus, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Reeves and Hammon, 1946; Quisenberry and Wallace, 1959; Joyce, 1961; Larish and Savage, 2005; LaPointe, 2007; La- Pointe et al., 2009). Further, Cx. annulir- ostris and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus have been intercepted on numerous occasions from aircraft arriving in Honolulu (Joyce, 1961). Finally, unlike some birds in the mainland United States in which cross- protective anti-WNV antibodies may in- hibit JEV amplification in blood (Nemeth et al., 2009), Hawaiian birds are likely immunologically naive and, therefore, more susceptible to adverse effects of flavivirus infection. The effects of JEV infection in birds remain unknown. Recent flavivirus dispersal includes WNV spread from the Middle East to the United States and JEV from Southeast Asia to Australia. While the mechanism of spread remains unknown, these invasions signify the perpetual threat of pathogen emergence. In addition to global travel, human movement into previously unin- habited areas and associated changes in 662 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES, VOL. 46, NO. 2, APRIL 2010 Downloaded From: https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Diseases on 04 Mar 2019 Terms of Use: https://bioone.org/terms-of-use Access provided by University of California Davis land and water use may facilitate pathogen emergence and establishment (Mackenzie et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004). While the geographic spread of highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 avian influenza virus is closely monitored on a global scale, JEV and other arboviruses merit worldwide attention as significant zoonotic patho- gens. The possibility of rapid and wide- ranging pathogen spread is greater than ever, and surveillance for novel invasions, especially involving wildlife, may provide an early warning and lead to mitigation of epidemic threats.

Bag 24, Geelong 3220, Australia Accepted 9 March 2006 Abstract A regional survey was conducted in Nepal for antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in domestic animals. Sera from pigs, and limited numbers of ducks and horses were collected from 16 districts in 2002–2003 and subjected to three serological tests. Of 270 porcine sera tested by C- ELISA, 55% were found positive for the presence of antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus. Additional testing for IgM antibody to JEV revealed less than 2% of C-ELISA positive sera had evidence of recent JEV infection. Plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT) using JEV, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVEV) and Kunjin (KUNV) viruses implicated JEV as the flavivirus associated with the observed antibody response in most sero-positive pigs. However, eight porcine sera with predominant neutralising antibody for KUNV (an Australasian subtype of West Nile Virus) provided evidence for the circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal. q 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Japanese encephalitis is an emerging disease of animals and humans, spread by mosquitoes to a range of susceptible wild and domestic vertebrate hosts [1]. Endemic cycling of the causative Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from mosquitoes to ardeid water birds creates a reservoir for spill-over to other species in times of peak transmission, generally associated with warm month high vector prevalence. At such times, infection of pigs in the vicinity of human habitation correlates with the occurrence of human disease. High viraemic levels in pigs promote infection of mosquito species that can readily transmit the virus to humans [2]. In the southern lowlands of Nepal, irrigated rice fields provide ample mosquito breeding sites in proximity with humans and domestic animals, ensuring favourable conditions for human JEV infection [3]. Japanese encephalitis has been recognised in Nepal since 1978 [4] and has progressed to be now the major cause of seasonal meningo-encephalitic related morbidity and mortality [5,6]. Since 1987 annual outbreaks of human JEV disease, peaking in September, have been reported causing up to 2000–3000 cases and 200–400 deaths per year. More than half the cases and deaths were reported from two districts Kailali and Banke. In the large 1997 outbreak, three western districts Banke, Bardia and Kailali encompassed more than 80% of the 2403 reported cases and in 335 deaths [6]. The virus now occurs in 27 districts of the country, including the Kathmandu valley and an estimated 12 million people are at risk. Although JEV is a recognised cause of disease in pigs and horses, most infections of domestic animals in JEV endemic areas are asymptomatic and human disease imperatives are predominant [2]. In 2001, the Nepal Department of Livestock Services implemented control measure, which recognised the significant role of pigs for human JEV infection by vaccination of 45,213 pigs in held in tarai (lowland border district) zones with live attenuated virus [7]. Approximately, 40% of the Nepal pig population (about 359,000 pigs) is held in these lowland JEV endemic districts. While pigs are critically involved in epizootics of JEV, there have been only limited studies in Nepal, which might assist targeting vaccination programs [3,8]. The lack of diagnostic facilities for JEV at the G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175168 Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Kathmandu was addressed in a collaborative and training project with the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong. In the year 2002–2003, the CVL launched a program to monitor for evidence of JEV infection with this virus in domestic animals. This paper presents an assessment of the laboratory testing undertaken on sera collected from that survey. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Viruses Viruses and antigens used in serologic assays were originated from the following sources: JEV Nakayama strain derived from a 1956 stock held at AAHL; MVEV MRM66 and KUNV MRM16 isolates were both obtained from Public Health Virology, Queensland Health Scientific Services, Australia. 2.2. Sera A total of 270 sera were collected in 2002–2003 from pigs, ducks and horses by visiting various livestock farms of 16 different district (see Fig 1) tarai regions, where high incidence of human infection has previously been recorded [5]. These sera were stored at K20 8C until testing. Testing of sera was conducted at the AAHL and CVL institutes. Fig. 1. Map of Nepal showing districts in which animals were sampled for serology. G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 169 From 270 collected sera, 200 (pig sera only) were heat treated for 30 min at 56 8C before shipment to Australia for testing. On arrival sera were treated by gamma irradiation for 50 kGy to ensure inactivation of potentially exotic agents. The remaining 70 pigs ducks and horse sera were tested at CVL after the establishment of JEV serology capability. 2.3. JEV C-ELISA serology The competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) for detection of antibody to JEV has previously been described [9]. In brief, (a) polyvinyl 96-well plates were coated with JEV antigen, (b) serum was added at 1/10 dilution, (c) monoclonal antibody JEV-995 [10] was added to the serum in ELISA plates, (d) enzyme-antibody conjugate was anti-mouse/horse radish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA), and (e) tetramethyl benzidine (TMB)–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS (pH 7.2)— 0.05% Tween-20 wash steps separated steps (a)–(e). Substrate conversion was stopped by addition of sulphuric acid (1 M), and the plates immediately read in a microplate photometer (Labsystems, Finland) at wavelength 450 nm. Resultant optical densities (OD) were converted to percent inhibition relative to a normal pig serum control. 2.4. JEV IgM ELISA serology The IgM ELISA was a standard antibody capture format modified from other studies [11,12]. In brief, (a) ELISA plates were coated with an anti-swine IgM (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and (b) sera were tested at 1/300 dilution in PBS (pH 7.2), 0.05% Tween-20, 1% skim milk, (c) inactivated JEV antigen, PEG concentrated from infected culture supernatant medium was applied at an optimal dilution (1/200), (d) JEV-989 antibody labelled with fluorescein (used as a hapten, not fluorophor) was bound to trapped antigen. (e) Enzyme- antibody conjugate was anti-fluorescein/horse radish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories Ltd, Peterborough, UK) and (f) TMB–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS-tween wash steps separated steps (a)–(f). Substrate and plate reading were as for the C-ELISA, while OD values were converted to percent positive control. 2.5. Plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) serology PRNT serology was used to test for specific neutralising antibody against JEV. Two related flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses (MVEV and KUNV, respectively), were included together with JEV for all PRNTs. Sera were tested in a PRNT according to standard methodology [13] using 24-well plates. In brief, sera were tested in serial dilution fourfold from 1/40 to 1/1280. Serum dilutions were mixed with an equal volume containing approximately 50 plaque forming units of virus and incubated for 90 min. Two-hundred microliters of the mixture was transferred to 24-well plates with confluent Vero cell monolayers. After 90 min a carboxy-methyl cellulose overlay medium was added. After 4–5 days plates were fixed and stained with formol saline—0.1% methylene blue then counted for plaques. The 50% plaque reduction end-point titres were estimated by linear interpolation between dilutions (log value) and plaque counts to give a continuous scale of results over the dilution series. Some sera with PRNT titres of less than G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175170 40 were retested in a screening test using sera at a 1/10 dilution only. Results were reported as ‘!10’ or ‘10–40’. Sera were generally tested only once unless anomalies were evident on analysis. Internal quality control monitored input virus, positive and negative control sera to ensure inter-assay consistency. 3. Results 3.1. JEV C-ELISA serology Fig. 1 shows areas of Nepal where we obtained the test samples, which were predominantly from pigs. Initial testing of serum samples was carried out by JEV C-ELISA. Antibodies against JEV were detected in 154 of 251 pigs (61%) using the JEV C-ELISA (Table 1). In all districts, there was evidence for infection of animals with JEV. Correlation of results with the geographical origin of the sera from within Nepal demonstrated that highest proportion of antibody positive animals were located in the Far- Western region (89% JEV antibody positive) with the lowest rates in the Central region (39% JEV antibody positive). Additional JEV C-ELISA serology in four horses and 11 ducks showed 50 and 7% sero-positive animals, respectively. 3.2. JEV IgM serology IgM ELISA was performed on 119 C-ELISA positive sera to measure the frequency of recent exposure to JEV. Only two sera (or 1.7%) were positive for IgM antibody to JEV. These sera originated from pigs, respectively, located in Makwanpur (collected in November) and Siraha (collected in May) districts.

Of the 200 pig sera sent to AAHL, almost all were tested by JEV C-ELISA and PRNT for antibody to JEV and related flaviviruses MVEV and KUNV. Ranking by titre, independently for each of the three viruses (Table 2) gave distribution profiles for the tested population. The profile showed greater numbers of sera having the highest antibody levels against JEV as might be expected in an area endemic for this virus. Antibody detected in an animal as a heterotypic response to related viruses will, in the absence of those viruses, generally be evident as a lesser titre to that against the homologous virus. For each PRNT positive serum, calculation of titre ratios (JEV:MVEV and JEV:KUNV) confirmed that JEV PRNT titres were on average five times the level of MVEV PRNT titres and 10 times the KUNV titre values, consistent with a specific JEV antibody response relative to the two related flaviviruses. JEV-C-ELISA and PRNT results were compared in 2!2 pair-wise tables for agreement (Table 3). PRNT results were scored as positive or negative using either JEV PRNT results only, or more broadly using combined JEV/MVEV/KUNV PRNT results. In the latter grouping, a positive in any of the three PRNTs was scored as positive for the purpose of comparison with the JEV C-ELISA. The overall results were similar for the two groupings with about 60–70% agreement between the assay results, and the discrepancies evenly split between the two available options. One effect of broadening the scope for comparison of C-ELISA and PRNT to include MVEV and KUNV was the identification of nine sera, negative by JEV ELISA and JEV PRNT, but positive for antibody against either, or both of the other flaviviruses. These results are detailed as they may provide some insight into additional flaviviruses that circulate in Nepal (Table 4). Also included are results, which, although detected as JEV C-ELISA positive, evidenced greater PRNT titres against either MVEV and/or KUNV, than JEV. From the groups of sera with higher PRNT titre levels (O40), there were two sera for which antibody titres against MVEV were at least four times the corresponding JEV titres, and four sera for which antibody titres against KUNV were four times or Table 2 Range of PRNT titres in 200 porcine sera for tested antibody against JEV, MVEV and KUNV PRNT titre Number of sera with this PRNT result for: JEVa MVEV KUNV Less than 40 86 97 105 40–100 13 15 20 100–500 21 36 22 500–1000 9 13 12 Greater than 1000 55 23 23 Positive in screen test only 15 12 14 Not testedb 1 4 4 Total 200 200 200 a Data are presented as groupings of PRNT results sorted independently for each of the three viruses. b There was insufficient serum volume to complete testing.

Some clustering of sera by district of origin relative to these non-JEV reaction patterns was also noted.

Discussion Previous published studies of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal have addressed issues of diagnosis and emerging prevalence in human populations [5,6] and though the involvement of domestic animals, in particular pigs [3,8], has been recognised as a risk G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 173 factor, there has been no broad surveillance to determine the prevalence of infection in pigs or other susceptible animals. The lowland provinces of Nepal have proven a favourable environment for JEV to become established and emerge as a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Effective control measures must be founded on sound epidemiological investigation. The extent and involvement of pigs and possibly other animals as risk factors for mosquito transmission of the virus to humans is an essential component. This study presents results, which provide evidence that antibody to JEV is in pigs widespread across 16 districts. Though sample numbers are relatively low, the mean seroprevalence of greater than 90% in the Far Western region (Table 1) is evidence for intense circulation of JEV in these animals. It is significant that the highest rates of human JEV disease has been described in the western districts [14], therein correlating with our results of high proportions of JEV antibody positive pigs in these districts. Circulation of JEV is affected by animal management practices and the co-location of pigs and human dwellings is an obvious risk factor for human disease. In Nepal, pigs are generally animals that will be sold for meat after relatively short periods (1–2 years). Annual farrowing, together with removal of immune animals, ensures non-immune pigs will exist each year, heightening the risk for human disease. The absence of IgM antibody to JEV amongst the tested animals is not surprising, when the following factors are taken into account. None of the samples were collected in the months of August/September, when peak transmission of the virus in pigs might be expected, based on human epidemiological patterns of JEV. Furthermore, the duration of detectable IgM in pigs is relatively short [11], averaging only 3 weeks and would not be expected to persist in those months in which samples were collected. A wide range of animal species may be infected and develop antibodies to JEV. It might, therefore, be expected that sera collected from horses and ducks in an endemic region could be seropositive. This was the case for two of four horse sera collected in Parsa district and one duck serum from Banke district (Table 1). These species are not significant in the maintenance cycle of JEV, but this is the first report for involvement of equines in Nepal. In regions in which multiple flaviviruses might potentially cause infections, the determination of a specific flavivirus antibody response can be problematic as the potential influence of related flaviviruses on serological investigations for these viruses is well recognised [15]. In applying a range of serology approaches in this study, we were attempting to evaluate the specificity of the detected immune response against JEV and investigate the likelihood of any recent infection. The JEV C-ELISA has been shown to detect antibody against related flaviviruses (Table 3 and [9]), and while the PRNT is a more specific test, field animals subjected to multiple exposures with a range of flaviviruses have a broadened neutralising antibody response. The titre magnitude and the relative differential of serum titres against different viruses have been used to evaluate the significance of results. For this reason, we included two related flaviviruses MVEV and KUNV) as well as JEV in our PRNT testing for neutralising antibody. On the basis of predominant titre levels, there is good evidence that detected antibody generally represented exposure to JEV (Table 2). G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175174 The interpretation of the serology results must also allow for the possible influence of JEV vaccination as a contributing factor to positive antibody determinations. However, moderating considerations relate to the timing of vaccination, the turnover of animal stock and the neutralising titres observed in the test animals. While the history of vaccination for the tested animals was not available, collection of sera occurred 1–2 years after the 2001 vaccination campaign. Also only a small proportion of pigs were vaccinated and it is unlikely that vaccination would have produced the high neutralising titres frequently seen in the group of JEV seropositive animals in this study. There is little information on the range of flaviviruses that may circulate in Nepal, though JEV and dengue virus are recognised in humans [3]. West Nile virus has been demonstrated in India [16], while the tick-borne flavivirus Kyasanur Forest has also been identified in that country [17]. There were results for some sera in our survey for which an interpretation of JE exposure was not particularly appropriate. Sera were identified that had predominant neutralising activity for either KUNV or MVEV, providing evidence for the circulation of flaviviruses other than JEV. This is particularly the case for sera that were positive for PRNT antibody to KUNV but negative by JEV C-ELISA, e.g. sera 78 and 90 (Table 4). KUNV is now recognised as an Australasian variant of WNV [18,19], and in Nepal, predominant neutralising titres against KUNV is presumptive evidence for WNV circulation [20]. We believe that there have not previously been reports for this virus in Nepal, however, WNV has been isolated from pig sera in India [21]. Prior infection in pigs with JEV may inhibit WNV viraemia [22], which may be a factor in our detection of antibody to WNV only in districts with a relatively low prevalence of JEV. While JEV is considerably more important as a human epizootic virosis than a production animal disease agent, the significance of pigs in the amplification cycle introduces an additional basis for involvement of veterinary authorities in monitoring for this agent. Accurate laboratory based detection and diagnosis is a crucial platform from which to extend control measures [20]. Collaborative work associated with this publication has transferred the capability for JEV diagnosis to the Central Veterinary laboratory in Nepal. Control of the disease will ultimately require effective human vaccination as vaccination of pigs is not considered a useful control measure [23]. However, there is indeed a role for integration between veterinary and public health authorities in determining the epidemiology of infection and prospective surveillance for JEV. Our results indicating the likely circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal are also of value in consideration of the aetiology human disease presenting as febrile or encephalitic syndromes.

Reviews in Medical Virology DOI: 10.1002/rmv.495 Kyasanur forest disease: an epidemiological view in India Priyabrata Pattnaik* Virology Division, Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, India SUMMARY Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India. The causative agent, KFD virus (KFDV), is a highly pathogenic member in the family Flaviviridae, producing a haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings. KFD is a zoonotic disease and has so far been localised only in a southern part of India. The exact cause of its emergence in the mid 1950s is not known. A variant of KFDV, char- acterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been recently identified in Saudi Arabia. KFDV and AHFV share 89% sequence homology, suggesting common ancestral origin. Homology modelling of KFDV envelope (E) protein exhibited a structure similar to those of other flaviviruses, suggesting a common mechanism of virus-cell fusion. The possible mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction involved in infection by KFDV may resemble that of other flavivirses. Present understanding is that KFDV may be persisting silently in several regions of India and that antigenic and structural differences from other tick borne viruses may be related to the unique host specificity and pathogenicity of KFDV. From January 1999 through January 2005, an increasing number of KFD cases have been detected in Karnataka state of Indian subcontinent despite routine vaccination, suggesting insufficient efficacy of the current vaccine protocol. However, the exact cause of the increase of KFD cases needs further investigation. Considering the requirement of safer and more effective vaccines in general, there is clearly a need for developing an alternative vaccine as well as a rapid diagnostic system for KFD. The changing ecology of the prime focus of the KFD also warrants attention, as it may lead to establishment of the disease in newer localities, never reported before.

Received: 10 September 2005; Revised: 6 January 2006; Accepted: 13 January 2006 INTRODUCTION KFDV that causes a haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings is a highly pathogenic member of the family Flaviviridae. KFD was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga dis- trict of Karnataka state (then Mysore) of India in 1957 [1,2]. KFDV commonly infects the black faced langur (Presbytis entellus) and red faced bonnet monkey (Macaca radiate). KFDV is of zoonotic ori- gin and gets transmitted by the bite of infective ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera), especially at its nymphal stage, and the ticks remain infectious throughout their lives. KFDV also circulates in small animals such as rodents, shrews and birds [3]. Adult ticks mostly feed on large animals, as they serve as a good host for tick proliferation, however they do not suffer from the disease. Neutralising antibodies have been found in cattle, buffaloes, goats, wild bears, porcupines, squirrels, rats, mice and a number of avian species (Table 1). Direct transmission of the virus from rodents to humans is possible; however, person-to-person transmission has not been documented. Besides, KFDV is regarded as a potential biowarfare agent [19]. KFDV belongs to the Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus group and the antibodies cross react with other RSSE group members. Although isolated cases of KFD and RSSE have been reported from several parts of India, epi- demics of KFD mostly remain confined in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Epidemics of KFD were controlled to a great extent using a formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in chick embryo fibroblasts [20].

TBEV (tick born encephalitis virus) group, the exact causes of the sudden emergence of KFDV in India during the late 1950s and the subsequent localisation to Karnataka state alone are not clear. Despite its high pathogenicity and potential epide- miological importance, there have been relatively few detailed antigenic and molecular studies on KFD virus. The only molecular information avail- able is the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the vital structural proteins [21]. According to the internationally accepted bio- safety rules, KFDV is a level-4 virus. KFDV is a spherical, enveloped virus of 45 nm diameter. It has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. The virus is lethal to infant and weaning mice when inoculated through the intracerebral or intraperitoneal route. It is cytopathic and produces plaques in chick embryo, hamster kidney and monkey kidney cell cultures, but replicates with- out cytopathic effect in a continuous line of Haemaphysalis spinigera tick cells [22]. The early clinical signs of KFD in humans involve sudden onset of fever and headache, followed by back pain, severe pain in lower and upper extremi- ties, prostration as well as biphasic course of illness. Subsequently to fever, haemorrhagic mani- festations, including intermittent epistaxis, haema- temesis, melena and frank blood in the stools, are Table 1.

In some cases, central nervous system abnormalities develop after an afebrile period of 1–2 weeks. A mild meningoence- phalitis also occurs frequently amongst a small portion of patients, developing coma or bronchop- neumonia prior to death. IgE has also been impli- cated as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possibly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23]. The exact cause of haemorrhage is not known although disseminated intravascular coagulation is suspected. Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus and KFDV are two important viruses under the family Flaviviridae that are genetically closely related to TBEV, but produce haemorrhagic fever instead of encephalitis [3]. ECOLOGY KFDV was first isolated from sick monkeys cap- tured in Kyasanur forest of Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India, hence the name. Shimoga is located at 571 metres altitude, between 13�270 and 14�390 north longitude, and between 74�380 and 76�40 latitude. The Shimoga district of Karna- taka state is full of closed forests and few open for- ests (Figure 1). Shimoga has 276855 hectares of forest land. Wild monkeys, Presbytis entellus (Black faced langur) andMacaca radiate (Red faced bonnet monkey), are very common in the forest localities that commonly get infected by KFDV through bites of infected ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera). Other than Haemaphysalis spinigera, KFDV has also been isolated from 16 different types of ticks (Table 2). Unfed nymphs are highly anthropophi- lic and transmit the disease to humans bites. Ticks also transmit the virus transovarialy. Frequent transmission of KFDV via active nymphs has been reported during October to December months. Fed female adult ticks lay a huge number of eggs which hatch to larvae under the leaves in the forests. The ticks drop from leaves on small mammals and monkeys on which the larvae feed and later mature to nymphs, and the cycle is repeated (Figure 2). Bhat and his coworker [31] conducted a classical experiment, by allowing larvae of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides to feed on KFDV infected viremic rodents and rearing the KFDV infected larvae to the next generation. In this study they found that the fed larvae, nymphs, unfed adults, fed adult males and females after oviposition were infected, while the unfed larvae were free from infection. Nymphs and adults Figure 1. Map of Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India.

An infected adult tick shows a titre of 3–5� 106 mouse LD50/ 30 ml, and the virus can be detected for as long as 245 days after infection [31]. It has been shown that the presence of KFDV specific neutralising antibo- dies in fed blood has no effect on survival of KFDV in the ticks [39]. In Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab area), the central focus of the KFD was established in great part due to deep encroachment of human colonisation on a primitive sylvan territory. Originally, most of the vegetation consisted of tall rain forest interspersed with deciduous and semi-deciduous forest on the slopes and on the ridges of rolling hills with mixed bamboo and shrub jungle at the edges. The rainy season lasts from June to September, but the rain- fall varies greatly from one year to another, with a mean of 85 inches per year. The humid and rela- tively fertile bottoms between the terrain’s undula- tions are adequate for the cultivation of paddy fields. High humidity generated from the culti- vated fields is suitable for maintenance of the ticks throughout the year and availability of nearby for- est sustains a large population of wild moneys. Such ecological specificity is rarely seen in any other parts of India. All these in combination may be responsible for the geographical localisa- tion of KFDV only to Karnataka state of India. Local villagers staying in and around the forest area frequently visit the forest for collection of fire woods and get infected through tick bites. Generally women mostly visit the forest for fire wood collec- tion, whereas children do not. Men are in between. So, women have the highest opportunity to get infected whereas children have the lowest. The ecology of Shimoga area of Karnataka state is very special due to presence of divergent bio- types of forests, cultivated areas and grasslands in and around a common place. A local mechan- ism of maintenance of KFDV in this area presup- poses the presence of several elements. Presence of adequate animal reservoir in this area, a large population of carriers having consistent suscept- ibility, the ability to circulate KFDV and the cap- ability to infect an adequate number of vectors in Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area are thought to be important for sustenance of KFDV. A series of vec- tors with proved affinity for the reservoir host and capacity to become infected with KFDV acquired from the host is a critical factor for persistence of KFDV in Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area. Seasonal fluctuations of phase density of ticks in these areas are so timed that transmission of KFDV through Table 2.

Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. consecutive seasons is ascertained, independent of individual variations in vector density [40]. EPIDEMIOLOGY In the Kyasanur Forest two species of wild mon- keys, Presbytis entellus (Black faced langur) and Macaca radiate (Red faced bonnet monkey), com- monly succumb to the natural infection with KFDV. Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 P. entellus and 186 M. radiata) died, and KFDV was isolated from 118 P. entellus and 13 M. radiata. High mortality of monkeys was generally observed from December to May which coincided with the seasonal activity of immature stages of Haemaphysalis ticks, the incriminated vec- tors of KFDV. Epizootiology of KFD in wild moneys of Shimoga, specifically the death of monkeys in dry seasons (February and March) correlates well with human cases of KFD [41]. Several studies have con- firmed the susceptibility of Macaca radiata (bonnet macaques) to KFD and demonstrated KFDV specific gastrointestinal and lymphoid lesions [42]. The epidemic period correlated well with the period of greatest human activity in the forest, after the monsoon (June-September) was over; i.e. November to December for the paddy harvest and December to May, the period to gather firewood and other for- est products [43]. KFD epizootic is initially characterised by the spread of the disease to the areas contiguous with the original focus of infection. Since the first record, the epidemics of KFD have occurred repeatedly in Shimoga district of Karnataka and in its adjoining areas. During the epizootic period of 1964–1965, monkey deaths occurred only within the previously known infected area. During 1965– 1966 the epizootic extended towards a contiguous forest south-east of Sagar town involving an area covering approximately 30 km2. The epizootics which appeared within the original infected area between October 1966 and September 1969 show- ed a tendency to move north-west of Sorab town. During the epizootic season of 1969–1970 and 1970–1971 monkey deaths occurred in Yakshi and Gudavi forests located further north-west of Sorab town. During 1971–1972, epizootics contin- ued to occur in the old focus of Sagar and Sorab taluk and occurred in a new focus at Gadgeri and a nearby valley. By the end of year 1973, epi- zootics and epidemics were recognised in several new foci, distant from the original focus. The new foci were Aramanekoppa in Hosanagar taluk of Shimoga district and Kodani in Honnavar taluk of North Kanara disctrict. It was also observed in certain localities of original focus (Barur, Jambai, Maisavi and Padavagodu) that the KFDV activity persisted over several years [44]. During 1975 epizootics KFD spread to Mandagadde area in Thirthahalli taluk, Shimoga district approxi- mately 50 km south–west of the periphery of Aramanekoppa focus. Later in during 1982 the dis- ease appeared at Patrame area in Beltangady taluk, South Kanara district, approximately 80 km south of the periphery of Mandagadde focus [44]. Other than Karnataka state, the primary site of introduction of KFDV, antibodies against KFDV have also been detected in humans in several parts of Kutch and Saurashtra of Gujrat state (semi-arid area, around 1200 km away from main focus of KFD) and isolated localities like Ramtek (near Nagpur), Kingaon and Parbatpur of West Bengal state of India [45]. A recent serological survey, con- ducted among the human population of the Andaman and Nicobar islands of India, reported the highest prevalence of HI (hemagglutination inhibition) antibodies against KFDV. Neutralising antibodies to KFDV were detected in Middle Andaman. Sex specific prevalence of neutralising antibodies to KFDV was significantly higher in males than in females in Andaman and Nicobar islands of India [46]. Considering the above find- ings, Andaman and Nicobar islands of India might be a major silent focus of KFDV activity, but there is no corroborative data from case reports of KFD. A variant genotype of KFDV, characterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma hae- morrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been identified in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [47]. AFHV was first isolated in the 1990s from the blood of a butcher. Since then a total of 24 cases were reported in the last 10 years and most of these cases were originated from Mecca or Jeddah of Saudi Arabia [48]. More recently, 37 cases have been reported through February 2001 to February 2003 from Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Until 1999, not more than three cases of AHF per year had been reported. Recent increase of AHF cases in Saudi Arabia may be due to better reporting and early identifi- cation of the disease. The transmission of most of the reported AHF cases was via wound, camel raw milk, tick/mosquito bite or direct contact with the infected animals. Although the sources of AHF Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 155155 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. infection are very diverse, most of the cases were localised in either Mecca or Jeddah. Any wide- spread epidemic of AHF has not occurred in Saudi Arabia perhaps due to scarce distribution of virus. In contrast, India has experienced several KFD epi- demics, although they have been very much con- fined to Karnatak state. Epidemics of KFD were controlled to a great extent after successful devel- opment of a formalin-inactivated vaccine pro- duced in chick embryo fibroblasts [20,49,50]. However, the recent data on the incidence of KFD cases (unpublished) from five districts of Kar- nataka state, namely Shimoga, Udupi, Mangalore, Chickmangalore and Uttar Kannada suggest that the number of cases has increased in the last five years despite the routine vaccination (Figure 3). CLINICAL, PATHOLOGICAL AND HAEMATOLOGICAL FEATURES Concurrently with the KFDV isolation and identi- fication, there have been KFD outbreaks of febrile and occasionally fatal illnesses among peo- ple living in the vicinity of Shimoga district of Kar- nataka. The incubation period before sudden manifestation of the disease varies between 3– 8 days (Figure 4). After this initial stage a biphasic course with mild meningoencephalitis and fever developing after an afebrile period of 1–2 weeks is common. Relative bradycardia is frequently seen along with inflammation of the conjuctiva. A small proportion of patients develop coma or bronchopneumonia prior to death. The acute phase of illness lasts for �2 weeks (Figure 4). The case fatality in KFD is 2–10% [1], significantly lower than in Alkhurma virus infection where case fatality has been reported to be 25% [51]. Conva- lescence in KFD survivors is generally pro- longed—up to 4 weeks (Figure 4). Viremia in KFD patients lasts for 12–13 days of illness and unlike most other arboviruses (Figure 4), KFDV is easily isolated from human sera. The level of virus in blood circulation is considerably high (3.1� 106), especially during the period of 3–6 days after the onset of illness [52]. Leukopenia is a constant feature in KFD patients and was due to a reduction in both neutrophils and lymphocytes. In most cases neutrophil count drops below 2000 cells/ml. Figure 3. Number of KFD positive cases per month spanning January 1999-January 2005 Figure 4. Viremia ( ) during the clinical course of KFD 156156 P. PattnaikP. Pattnaik Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. Lymphopenia was usually observed within the first week of illness and significant eosinopenia during the first or early in the second week. In several pati- ents lymphocytosis was also observed between the third and the fifth week [23]. Chatterjee et al. [53] considered that prominent thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in KFD are probably mediated through antibodies to platelets and leukocytes. They postu- lated that the KFD infection had directly or indir- ectly altered the antigenicity of these cells, triggering the production of antibodies to platelets and leukocytes. However, no experimental evidence is available in support of this postulation. Pathologic manifestations of KFD in human patients include parenchymal degeneration of the liver and kidney, haemorrhagic pneumonitis, and a moderate to marked prominence of the reticulo- endothelial elements in the liver and spleen, with marked erythrophagocytosis [54]. Pathologic and haematologic investigations emphasised similarities between KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever. Later there was a shift in clinical emphasis from haemor- rhagic to neurologic complications [55,56]. During KFDV infection, interferonemia is concomitant with the viremic phase. IgE has also been implicated as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possi- bly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23]. Neutralisation studies indicated that the endogenous (circulating) interferon (IFN) was antigenically similar to acid stable form of IFN-alpha. Sathe et al. [57] monitored endogenous IFN levels in acute (51) and convales- cent phase (19) sera collected from KFD patients and reported that the levels of circulating IFN in the acute samples (GM 216.3þ/� 8.7) collected between 4–7 post onset day (POD) were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the convalescent samples (GM 13.19þ/� 1.6) collected between 30–90 POD. Clinical or postmortem biopsies of various organs suggested that KFD could pass through four stages each lasting for about a week; i.e. a prodromal stage with fever, hypotension and hepatomegaly, a stage of complication charac- terised by haemorrhage, neurological manifestation or bronchopneumonia, a stage of recovery followed by a stage of fever in some cases. Adhikary Prabha and the coworkers [58] clinically studied 100 cases of KFD and conducted biopsies of various organs. They interpreted that hypotension in KFD could be of myocardial origin, whereas encephalopathy could be due to a metabolic cause probably of hepatic origin and lung signs due to intra-alveolar haemorrhage and secondary infections [58]. Clinical manifestations caused by Alkhurma virus (ALKV), a variant/strain of KFDV include fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, gen- eralized muscle pain, anorexia and vomiting asso- ciated with leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and ele- vated levels of liver enzymes, alanine transferase and aspartate transferase [48]. Like KFDV, ALKV also produces encephalitic features such as confu- sion, disorientation, drowsiness, coma, neck stiff- ness, hemiparesis, paraparesis or convulsion and haemorrhagic manifestations such as ecchymosis, pupura, petechie, gastrointestinal bleeding, epis- taxia, bleeding from puncture sites or menorrhagia [51]. Like other haemmorhagic fever viruses, both KFDV and ALKV are zoonotic [59]. Unlike other haemorrhagic fever viruses classified under the Arenaviridae (Lassa and Junin viruses), Bunyabviridae (Hantaviruses), Filoviridae (Marburg and Ebola viruses), KFDV and ALKV classified under the Flaviviridae are vector-borne with less intensity of haemorrhagic manifestations than the others. Unlike KFDV, ALKV is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites or direct contact with the infected sheep or goats and ticks do not seem to be important in the transmission [51]. Although ALKV and KFDV are somewhat similar in clinical presentations, high mortality (25%) reported for ALKV infection is surprising. However, this may be due to limited numbers of actually reported cases. As more cases get reported, the high mortal- ity indexes may drop for ALKV infections. MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY KFDV shares the highest sequence homology with ALKV, a Saudi Arabian flavivirus. They share many common features, i.e. TB-flavivirus specific pentapeptide DSGHD at position 320–324, the fusion peptide, AKG motif at position 2–4 of the capsid protein, an extra amino acid residue arginine at position 93 of the capsid protein, EHLPKA hexapeptide at position 207–212 and EGSK motif at position 308–311 of the envelope protein, amino acid substitution at position 76 and 489 of the envelope protein [47]. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that both of the viruses might have evolved more than 1000 years ago (Figure 5), originated in African subcontinent and might have a common ancestor [60]. According to the current genetic criteria of classification, KFDV and ALKV Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 157157 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. constitute two genetic subtypes of the same virus species [47]. The exact nature of spread of KFDV and its origin are not certain. One school of thought is that the virus might have got introduced to India via migrant birds. If so, why KFDV thereafter stopped being introduced into India by migrant birds or was not carried to other parts of India remains a question. Sudden appearance of KFDV in 1957 might be due to the first introduction by migrant birds. The virus did not spread to other parts of the country and got adapted to the regional environmental/ecological conditions. Another pos- sibility is that KFDV might have been introduced to India a long time ago through the slave trade and silently perpetuated in the subcontinent, result- ing in an epidemic only in the year 1957, when it was first identified and reported. In any event, the possibility remains that KFD was present before 1957 without being recognised or reported. Gould et al. [60] clearly stated in their classical review on evolution and dispersal of encephalitis viruses that KFDV appeared to be geographically isolated from other members of the mammalian tick-borne virus groups and that the discovery of AHFV in Saudi Arabia in 1995 [61] now provided a rational explana- tion for the presence of KFDV in the Indian forest. KFDV and AHFV produce a similar haemorrhagic disease and share strong genetic similarity. It was estimated that the two viruses might have diverged 500–600 years ago [60]. In contrast, a recent report by Charrel et al. [48] states that the ancestral lineage of KFDV and AHFVmight have diverged 66–177 years ago and that AHFV strains have a 4- to 72-year per- iod of evolution. Studies on the population dyna- mics of several flaviviruses indicated that Powassan virus might have originated 275–393 years ago and divergence between tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) might have occurred 291–411 years ago [48]. Gould et al. [60] argue that KFDV and other hae- morrhagic and encephalitic tick-borne viruses almost certainly exist in other parts of India and in those countries that connect Saudi Arabia with India, but their presence has not yet been recog- nised nor demonstrated. To support their idea they further state that phylogenetic analysis of Karshi virus isolates from Uzbekistan and Rift val- ley fever virus isolates from Afganistan suggest them to be close relatives of KFDV and that all of them are transmitted by ticks. KFDV stands out from the western subtype, fareastern subtype and Siberian subtype of flaviviruses in the phylo- genetic analysis. The analysis suggests that possi- bly the tick borne flaviviruses evolved gradually, whereas mosquito borne viruses evolved more rapidly to become more divergent in the course of evolution [62]. Langat virus, which was found in southern Asia, also closely relates to Middle Eastern and Asian haemorrhagic fever viruses. Another haemorrhagic fever virus named Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) found in Siberia primarily resembles KFDV and AHFV. From sev- eral studies, it appears that OHFV has circulated harmlessly among indigenous small mammals [63,64]. Initial thought was that occurrence of OHFV was geographically placed, but later it was confirmed that the virus had been introduced to Siberia through muskrats and other species from North America in the 1930s [63]. The phylo- gentic relatedness of most of the haemorrhagic fever causing flaviviruses suggests that all of them belong to old world viruses [60]. Amino acid sequence of the envelope glycopro- tein of KFDV was found to share 80% sequence homology with that of TBEV. KFDV shares 38– 40% sequence homology with dengue virus, Japa- nese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses with positionally conserved cysteines. Genetic recombination among RNA viruses is Figure 5. Phylogenetic relationship (unrooted tree) based on the amino acid sequences of the Domain III of E proteins of flavi- viruses. Close lineage of KFDV and Alkhurma virus suggests their co-evolution from common ancestral origin 158158 P. PattnaikP. Pattnaik Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. known to occur [65,66]. Sequence analyses of KFDV indicate only divergent mutational changes, suggesting origination by mutation, rather than by recombination. The partial complementary DNA sequence of the NS5 region of KFDV, which acts as RNA dependant RNA polymerase, shares 99% sequence similarity with that of Alkhurma virus, followed by a homology of 94% with TBEV; 93% with OHF, Langat, RSSE, Negishi viruses; 88% with Meaban virus; 87% with Kadam, Saumarez Reef, Tyuleniy viruses; 81% with Koutango and Alfuy viruses; 80% with Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Apoi viruses and 76–78% with dengue and other related viruses. The complete coding sequence of the prototype strain of Alkhurma virus, which shares the highest homology with KFDV, is known. Genetic analysis of several human strains of Alkhurma virus showed a very low diversity [48]. Sequencing of 5 strains of KFDV showed minimal genetic divergence but all the strains had been isolated within a short time period, i.e. 1956–1958 (R. Charrel, Université de la Méditerranée, Marseille, France, personal communication). Lack of complete sequence data of KFDV isolates spanning a longer time period limits its divergence analysis. ANTIGENIC STRUCTURE There have been relatively few detailed antigenic or molecular studies on KFDV. The nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the viral structur- al proteins and the deduced aminoacid sequences indicated that KFDV is a distinct member in the tick-borne flavivirus complex with the envelope (E) protein containing the unique protease clea- vage sites, fusion peptide, signal sequences and hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The virus belongs to the TBEV antigenic complex. Thus far, no antigenic difference has been found among KFDV strains. Among the structural proteins, the E protein showed maximum similarity (77.4– 81.3%) to those of tick-borne flaviviruses. Align- ment of the amino acid sequence with those of other known tick-borne flavivirus sequences revealed many conserved regions confirming its identity as a member of the TBEV group. Com- parison of the E protein amino acid sequences between TBEV and KFDV indicates a high degree of conservation of cysteine residues and the three potential N-glycosylation sites. Venugopal et al. [21] indicated that KFDV E protein has a threonine to lysine substitution at 211aa position in the tick specific genetic marker EHLPTA, and that another genetic marker AQE at amino acid positions 232 to 234 is unique for KFDV. Homology modelling of the E protein of KFDV using the TBEV and Dengue-2 virus E proteins as the structural templates (Figure 6) revealed sequence and structure homologies of the fuso- genic motif (aa98–111 aa) between KFDV and TBEV, suggesting a common mechanism of envel- ope fusion for these two viruses. Comparison of the fusion sequence with Dengue and other mos- quito borne flavivirus sequences indicated histi- dine to glycine substitution at 104 aa position. Like other flaviviruses, envelope protein of KFDV also have three domains namely domain I, II and III (Figure 6). Domain I is regarded as the core to organise the whole structure. Domain II is a linearly discontinuous domain which has four disulphide bridges and bears the fusogenic motis at its tip. Domain III is thought to be Figure 6. Homology model structure of the ectodomain (aa 1–394) of KFDV E protein. Arrow indicates the position of fusogenic motif Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 159159 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. involved in the receptor-ligand interaction. Homology modelling of domain III revealed a high structural homology between KFDV and TBEV, suggesting a similar mechanism of recep- tor-ligand interaction for these two viruses [67]. However, Gresikova and Sekeyova [68] reported that monoclonal antibodies to TBEV exhibited very poor haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) with KFDV. Further, Tsekhanovskaya et al., by performing epitope analysis using monoclonal antibodies to the E protein of TBEV (Sofjin strain), reported that KFDV and TBEV differ from each other in the epitope mapping pattern [69]. They reported that there are more epitope- exchanges between TBEV and KFDV than between different TBEV strains. They hypothesised that except the flavi group specific epitopes, fine anti- genic map of KFDV may be different from that of TBEV. Although an amino acid sequence of the struc- tural proteins (envelope protein) of KFDV is very much similar to those of TBEV, the exact cause of different host specificity of KFDV is not under- stood. Based on the sequence homology, we located amino acid residues of KFDV on the crys- tal structure of envelope protein of TBEV. The majority of amino acid changes in KFDV in com- parison to TBEV were found to be residing on the molecular surface and exposed. In KFDV, the majority of the critical amino acid substitution have occurred in the domain III. Comparative eva- luation of amino acid sequences of domain III, the putative receptor binding domain of the E protein of KFDV and TBEV indicated a high degree of similarity with 19 amino acid changes in complete domain. Out of 19 amino acid changes only six positions had non-conservative replacements and the majority of them were conservative replace- ments, which maintained the structural integrity of Domain III. In Dengue virus, domain III has been implicated, though no direct evidence is available, for its interaction with heparin sulphate on the mammalian cell surface [70,71]. Its possible interaction with heparin sulphate may facilitate attachment of the virus and trigger internalisation. The domain III of KFDV shares a similar structural pattern with dengue virus domain III crystal struc- ture. In KFDV, the total architecture of modelled structure of domain III, including �-sheets and location of critical amino acids that are thought to be involved in receptor-ligand interaction, is similar, if not same, to that of the E protein of den- gue virus, suggesting that KFDV domain III may also have heparin sulphate binding property. We have also observed that recombinant domain III protein of KFDV binds immobilised heparan sul- phate (Pattnaik et al., Unpublished data). KFD VACCINE In general the antibodies raised against viral infec- tions are maintained for years at high levels due to repeated re-exposure to the virus in the form of subclinical infections or due to exposure to closely related viruses. Even in the absence of re-exposure, antibodies may persist for many years, as has been shown in several arboviruses [72–74]. Like other arboviruses, HI and compli- ment fixing (CF) antibodies begin to rise in the first week after the onset of KFD. Neutralising antibo- dies appear during the second week and at 3rd to 4th week the titres reach the peak. Antibody mediated immunity to KFDV persists for a decade even in the absence of re-exposure [75]. The very first vaccine tested early in the 1960s to control KFD in the area of Shimoga district, Mysore state of India was a 5–10% suspension of formalin-inactivated RSSE virus (mouse brain pre- paration) produced by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research laboratory, Washington, USA. It was injected subcutaneously, two doses a week apart followed by a third dose five weeks after the sec- ond shot. About 4000 vaccines displayed no unwanted reaction such as allergic and febrile reactions [76]. The vaccine induced weak HI anti- body response but stimulated no CF antibody response. The vaccine failed to evoke booster response in many individuals with previous KFDV infection. The RSSE vaccine thus was found to be ineffective in reducing the attack rate of KFD or in modifying the disease course [77,78]. Subsequently (in 1965), the first effort to pro- duce KFDV was made by growing KFDV in brains of infant Swiss albino mice and subsequent inacti- vation by formalin. The vaccine produced retained potency up to six months storage in refrigerator. It induced neutralising antibodies in mice [79]. An experimental KFDV vaccine was also produced by growing the virus in chick embryo, but the product was poorly immunogenic and failed to evoke neutralising response in mice [80]. Later in the year 1966, formalised experimental vaccine was prepared by growing KFDV in chick embryo 160160 P. PattnaikP. Pattnaik Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. fibroblasts cultures. The vaccine was found to be immunogenic, potent, stable and safe. [81,82]. Field trails with this tissue culture vaccine yielded satisfactory results, raising neutralising antibodies in 50% of the vaccines and inducing protective response in �23% vaccines [83]. Efforts were also made to develop a live attenuated KFDV vaccine by attenuating the strain P9605 though a serial tissue culture passages. Langurs (P. entel- lus) vaccinated with this attenuated KFDV gener- ated neutralising antibodies and resisted the challenge infection [84]. In another experiment two dosages of formalin-killed KFDV adminis- tered to langurs by subcutaneous route induced neutralising antibodies. The antibodies, though transient, could be detected up to 15 months after first vaccination. Whereas the vaccine did not pro- tect the langurs from challenge infection, it did prevent death [85]. A surveillance study indicated that the formalised KFDV vaccine has some but not absolute protective effect on the vaccines in Sagar-Sorab taluks of Shimoga district [50]. An attenuated Langat virus vaccine was also tested and showed protection against KFDV [86]. Kayser et al. [87] studied the human antibody response to immunisation with 17D yellow fever virus and inactivated TBEV vaccine. They reported that vac- cines producing HI titres� 20 against TBE showed cross-reaction with KFD. The formalin inactivated KFDV vaccine pro- duced in chick embryo fibroblasts has been licensed and is currently in use in the endemic areas in Karnataka state of India. The places for vaccination were selected on the basis of preva- lence of KFDV activity in the previous years, including the villages from which mortality in monkeys was reported and those adjacent to the KFDV affected areas. The efficacy of the vaccine was satisfactory, exerting a highly significant pro- tective effect [20]. Coverage of vaccine is fairly good. Almost all the individuals including chil- dren are being routinely vaccinated by the local government authorities. However, the occurrence of KFD cases, despite vaccination, has suggested some changes in virus antigenic determinants in due course. The KFDV strain currently used for vaccine preparation was isolated late in the 1950s. Thereafter, KFDV strains have not been well characterised at the molecular level, hence possible antigenic drifts and diversity since its first introduction in India during the late 1950s remain poorly understood. Increasing trend of KFD cases in Karnataka state warrants development of a new vaccine preparation that includes currently circu- lating KFDV. Improper storage of vaccine and lack of maintenance of cold chain result in inacti- vation of the vaccine and could be another reason for the emergent KFD despite routine vaccination. Until now no quick diagnostic kit is available for early diagnosis of KFD. Most of the cases are con- firmed based on syndromic diagnosis, HI test, immuno-fluorescence, and neutralisation test. Cattle have a low level of susceptibility to KFDV and antibody persists for very long period (~5 years). Hence, cattle can be used as an indicator for assessing past activity of KFDV in the field surveil- lance [88] but has not been considered practicable. CONCLUSION KFDV, despite regional significance, carries much importance related to origin, evolution, dispersal and antigenic diversity of flaviviruses. It is one of the few flaviviruses that show haemorrhagic man- ifestations. Ecology and epidemiology of KFDV are very unique with distinct clinical symptoms and pathological manifestations. Although KFDV has close phylogenetic relationship with Alkhur- ma virus, it will be interesting to study the causes of differences in species specificity and clinical representation between the two viruses. Earlier studies indicated that the antigenic structure of KFDV could be very different from that of TBEV. However, considering the positionally conserved cysteines and a similar structural feature of domain III of the E protein to those of other known flaviviruses, it could be inferred that KFDV may have similar receptor-ligand interaction. A com- mon mechanism of virus-cell fusion in virus entry, which is shared by KFDV and other flaviviruses, has also been suggested by amino acid sequence comparison and structural modelling of the E pro- teins. Although the available vaccine has once suc- cessfully controlled the KFD, the increasing trend of the disease in the last five years irrespective of routine vaccination is alarming. Such a trend may be indicative of the possible mutations in exposed antigenic domains of the virus, thereby allowing the virus to evade the immune response generated by the formalin inactivated vaccine. Lack of sequence data of recent isolates of KFDV restricts our understanding on the relationship of sequence diversity and antigenic diversity of this virus. We Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 161161 Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 151–165. speculate that KFDV may show altered degree of virulence due to many changing factors such as changes of social behaviour of humans like urbani- sation, rapid transport, and migration of people or of vectors, large scale changes in ecology due to deforestation, or building of dams or canals and changing agricultural practices. Extreme patho- genicity puts KFDV into the list of biological agents of weapon potential [19]. In our opinion, KFDV is unsuitable for offensive purpose because the case fatality for KFD virus is not high, because KFDV requires ticks for transmission and because human to human transmission is less likely. Bio- safety level-4 practices and containment facility are required for all activities in handling KFDV. Unavailability of BSL-4 facility in India has limited the efforts for extensive molecular investigation on KFDV. Considering the requirement of developing safer and more effective vaccines in general, it is important to make effort to develop an alternative vaccine version for KFD. A recombinant sub-unit vaccine or recombinant chimeric live vaccine could be the options. Development of a rapid and easy-to- use diagnostic system is also needed for the field surveillance of KFD.

To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses was conducted with 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated by 90% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater titer, 78 (10.3%) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7.8%) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3.2%) for WNV, two (0.3%) for Cacipacore virus and one (0.1%) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes. The detection of WNV- seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub- regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.

Outbreaks caused by other flaviviruses have also been reported in the country. In the 1970s, the largest Brazilian epidemic of arbovirus encephalitis was caused by Rocio virus (ROCV) in southeast Brazil [3]. More recently, an outbreak of hemorrhagic manifestations was linked to Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) [4]. Sporadic human cases caused by other sylvatic flaviviruses, including Bussuquara virus (BSQV), Ilheus virus (ILHV) and Cacipacore virus (CPCV) have also been reported in Brazil [5], [6], [7]. Furthermore, yellow fever epizootics in howler monkeys were reported in 2008 and 2009. Approximately 200 carcasses tested positive for Yellow fever virus (YFV) and about 2000 deaths were reported [8]. Thirteen flaviviruses have been reported in Brazil, listed here in chronological order of discovery: YFV, ILHV, BSQV, SLEV, ROCV, CPCV, Dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and Dengue virus 4 (DENV-4), Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), Iguape virus (IGUV), Naranjal-like virus (NJLV), Dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and Culex flavivirus (CXFV) [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. In 2009, serological evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Brazilian horses, was collected for the first time, in the Pantanal wetland region of Mato Grosso do Sul state (MS) [21]. The Pantanal wetland is a subtropical region of great biodiversity with strong potential for maintenance and evolution of mosquito-borne viruses. Comprising approximately 140,000 km2, the Pantanal is a vast sedimentary floodplain characterized by seasonal flooding which determines specific ecosystem processes, with the occurrence of plants and animals that are adapted to the annual shrinking and expansion of habitats due to the seasonal hydrological regime [22]. The region, which covers mainly Brazilian but also Paraguayan and Bolivian territories, is ecologically classified into 11 sub-regions according to vegetation, flooding and physiography. In Brazil, the Pantanal is located within the states of Mato Grosso (MT) and MS in the west- central region of the country [23]. Most of the flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or understudied in the Pantanal. A small number of investigations in the Nhecolândia Sub-region of the Pantanal, MS, have detected serological evidence for four flaviviruses, including ILHV, SLEV, WNV and CPCV [21], [24], [25]. Recently, three other serological studies reported the detection of neutralizing antibodies PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706 for WNV in equines from MT and again in MS, including from outside the boundaries of the Pantanal [26], [27], [28]. Complete surveys for flaviviruses in the Pantanal have not been reported. Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for WNV and the 11 Brazilian flaviviruses of potential medical importance, utilizing equines, sheep and caimans as indicators. Materials and Methods In October 2009, April, September and October 2010, blood samples were taken from 724 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 16 beef cattle ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,700 square-km in the Nhecolândia Sub-region of Pantanal, MS, west-central Brazil (Figure 1). Ethics statement The collections for this study were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (License CEUA- Fiocruz LW-1/12, protocol P-74/10-5) in compliance with the requirements of Brazilian Law 11794/2008, which rules on the scientific use of animals, including the principles of the Brazilian society of Science in laboratory animals. The collections were also approved by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (licenses IBAMA 18363-1/2009 and 18363-2/2010). Caimans were captured in two ranches from sites where a high concentration of these animals was observed. Caiman blood samples were obtained by puncture of the internal jugular vein between the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae as described previously [29]. Information recorded about caimans included gender, weight and snout-vent length. Blood samples from equines, including horses, donkeys and mules, and from sheep were taken by puncture of the jugular vein in 14 and nine different ranches, respectively. Gender, age, tameness, breed, vaccination status, travel history outside of Pantanal and history of abnormalities, such as clinical signs involving the central or peripheral nervous system, were recorded for each equine sample. Information about gender, age, breed and travel history outside of Pantanal were also recorded for each sheep. All animals sampled appeared healthy except for one horse that presented with clinical signs suggestive of neurological disorder. Additionally, 36 horse samples collected in February 2010 from a ranch comprising roughly a 900-square-km area in the Nabileque Sub-region of Pantanal, also located in MS (Figure 1) were tested. An outbreak of an undiagnosed neurological syndrome had caused the death of 16 equines at this location from December 2009 to January 2010. All equines here were vaccinated for rabies and tested negative for Trypanosoma evansi, a common pathogen involved in incoordination and instability of hind limbs in Pantanal equines. These equines had not been vaccinated for equine encephalitis viruses at the time of the outbreak. After the first deaths, the herd was vaccinated for eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses. All samples were initially screened for flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA as described previously [30]. Briefly, the ability of the sera to block the binding of the flavivirus group- reactive monoclonal antibody 6B6C-1 to the cell lysate-derived antigen for WNV was compared to the blocking ability of negative control horse serum. Samples were considered seropositive when the inhibition values produced were $30%. Samples with inhibition values between 19 and 29% were repeated twice to confirm the negative results. Blocking ELISA-positive samples were then heat- inactivated and tested by PRNT90, as previously described [31], for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses. Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions that ranged from 1:10–1:320 or 1:20–1:640 of each blocking ELISA seropositive sample were tested for their ability to neutralize plaque formation by WNV, SLEV, ILHV, CPCV, BSQV, IGUV, YFV (vaccine strain 17D), ROCV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 (recombinant ChimeriVax Dengue 3 virus) and DENV-4. Caiman and sheep samples that were negative by blocking ELISA were also tested by PRNT90 for WNV. All reference viruses used for PRNT were previously submitted to partial nucleotide sequencing of the N terminal region of NS5 gene to confirm viral identity. High identity scores were obtained with the following sequences deposited at GenBank: DENV-1 (FJ562106), DENV-2 (GQ398257), DENV-3 (recombinant Chi- meriVax Dengue 3 virus) (JN811143), DENV-4 (GQ199880), ROCV (AY632542), SLEV (EF158048), ILHV (AY632539), YFV (JN628279), BSQV (AY632536), CPCV (AF013367), IGUV (AY632538), and WNV (JN819325). Serum was considered seropositive to a virus when it reduced at least 90% of the formation of plaques of this virus and its reciprocal neutralizing antibody titer was at least four-fold greater than what was observed for the other 11 tested flaviviruses. The PRNT is the most specific serological test for the differentiation of flavivirus infections in convalescent serum samples [32]. Type-specific antibodies against flaviviruses can be distinguished using the PRNT [33]. The conservative criterion of four-fold greater titer is based on the results of cross-neutralization tests with flaviviruses and their respective antisera used for studies of antigenic relationships [34], [35]. Two or more flaviviruses are distinct from each other by quantitative serological criteria (four-fold or greater differences between homologous and heterologous titers of both serum samples) [32]. The Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used to test for positive trends in seroprevalence among age classes (StatXact 10.0, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA) Results All caiman and sheep serum samples were negative for flaviviruses-specific antibodies using the 6B6C-1 monoclonal antibody by blocking ELISA. When tested by PRNT90 for WNV, all caiman samples confirmed negative. Sixty caiman Author Summary West Nile virus is maintained in cycles between birds and mosquitoes and recently reemerged as a worldwide major public health and veterinarian concern as the cause of human and equine encephalitis outbreaks. Recent studies have reported serological evidence of West Nile virus circulation in Pantanal, west-central region of Brazil. However, considering the co-circulation of various cross- reactive flaviviruses in Brazil and that most of the flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or understudied in the Pantanal, serological results should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for West Nile virus and the 11 Brazilian flaviviruses of potential medical importance, utilizing equines, sheep and caimans as indicators, including 32 equines collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder had been recently reported among the equines. We found serological evidence of Ilheus, Saint Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Cacipacore and Rocio viruses in Pantanal equines. West Nile virus infection was not associated with the neurological disease of equines. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub-regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region. Widespread West Nile Virus in Pantanal Equines PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 2 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706 samples had PRNT90 titer ,10 and one ,40 for WNV (low sample volume of the latter required testing at a lowest dilution of 1:40). From 238 sheep samples tested, 235 had PRNT90 titers , 10, two showed low neutralizing antibodies titers of 20 and 10 and one ,40. From 760 equine samples initially screened for flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA, 396 (52.1%) were positive. When this subset was tested using PRNT90, 332 (43.7%) had neutralizing reactivity (PRNT90 titer $10) for ILHV, 251 (33%) for SLEV, 172 (22.6%) for WNV, 139 (18.3%) for CPCV, 130 (17.1%) for ROCV, 62 (8.2%) for IGUV, 14 (1.8%) for YFV, 12 (1.6%) for BSQV, four (0.5%) for DENV-1, three (0.4%) for DENV-2, one (0.1%) for DENV-4 and none for DENV-3 (Table 1). Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater PRNT90 titer, 77 (10.1%) equines were seropositive for ILHV, 59 (7.8%) for SLEV, 24 (3.2%) for WNV (see Table 2), two (0.3%) for CPCV and one (0.1%) for ROCV. From the remaining 232 blocking ELISA positive samples, 227 (29.9%) were considered seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus due to cross-reactivity and five (0.6%) were considered seronegative with neutralizing antibodies titers ,20 or ,10 for all of the flaviviruses that were assayed by PRNT90. These five may represent infections by an unknown flavivirus. Figure 1. Pantanal located in west-central Brazil.

Monotypic neutralization reactions (i.e. a sample that reacted with only one of the 12 flaviviruses in the panel) were detected for ILHV (n = 27), SLEV (n = 11) and WNV (n = 6). The only horse from Nhecolândia Sub-region that presented neurological signs was seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus with the following PRNT90 titers: 80 for SLEV, 40 for ILHV, 20 for YFV, 10 for ROCV and ,10 for all other flaviviruses tested. Neutralizing antibodies for WNV were detected in 172 equines from all 15 ranches that equines were tested. Considering the four- fold higher titer criterion as confirmation, the 24 confirmed WNV- seropositive equines were detected in ten ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,500 square-km in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located in MS (Figure 2). Besides the 24 WNV-seropositive equines, samples from 37 other equines presented PRNT90 titers for WNV $40 and among them 26 showed equal or higher titers for one of the other flaviviruses tested. For these 37 equines, the serology profile could not be interpreted to determine whether WNV reactivity was due to infection with WNV or cross-reactivity from other flavivirus infections. In fact, six of them were considered seropositive for one of the 11 other flavivirus tested (Table 3). Low level of neutralizing antibodies was detected for YFV, BSQV, IGUV, DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4 even though none of the equines were considered infected with these viruses. In some cases, the PRNT90 titers for YFV, BSQV and IGUV exceeded 20. Both ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines were detected in 14 of the 15 ranches that equines were tested, comprising roughly a 3,100-square-km area. The only ranch that had no ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines was ranch PS (Figure 2). From 760 equines tested, 441 (58%) had date of birth available. Stratifying the serology results by age demonstrated that risk of exposure to flaviviruses increased with age for flaviviruses in general and for ILHV (1-tailed p,0.001 for both), but not for SLEV (p = 0.17) or WNV (p = 0.46) (Figure 3). SLEV and WNV appeared to increase in prevalence with age for equines ,9 years of age, but not for older animals. Equines seropositive for CPCV and ROCV were sampled in October 2009. The two CPCV-seropositive horses were five and seven years of age and were from ranch PQ, which comprises an area of approximately 140 square-km. The only horse that was seropositive for ROCV had no record of birth date and was from ranch PM that encompasses a 360-square-km area. At the end of 2009, an outbreak of neurologic disease among horses was reported from ranch PV located in the Nabileque Sub- region. From 36 equines sampled, 23 (63.8%) were seropositive for flavivirus infection by blocking ELISA. When this subset was tested by PRNT90, 11 (30.5%) confirmed seropositive for SLEV, nine (25.0%) for undifferentiated flavivirus(es), two (5.5%) for WNV, and one (2.8%) for ILHV (Table 4). Of the nine undifferentiated flavivirus infections, five had SLEV titers .20 and five had higher SLEV titers than other flaviviruses in the panel, indicating that a majority of these could have had a history of SLEV infection. In addition to the relatively low seroprevalence for WNV of just 5.5% in this sample of 36 equines, four equines from this group that recovered from the recent neurologic syndrome were serologically negative for WNV (Table 4). In spite of recent vaccination against equine encephalitis viruses, most equines had low titers for equine encephalitis viruses. These results will be described separately. Figure 2.

However, cross- reactive antibody responses to closely related flaviviruses can complicate interpretation of serologic test results [36]. In particular, secondary flavivirus infections generate high levels of cross-reactive antibodies, which further complicate the interpretation of flavivirus serology. The cross-reacting antibodies of primary infections typically react with other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup comprised by WNV, CPCV, SLEV and others principally in Africa and Asia [37], [38], but antibodies generated by secondary flavivirus infections can also bind and neutralize viruses of other serogroups as well. Moreover, some individuals that are sequentially infected by a heterologous flavivirus species can boost antibody levels against the original virus, resulting in a phenomenon known as ‘original antigenic sin’ which can lead to incorrect diagnoses [39]. Finally, the potential circulation of unknown flaviviruses in the region could generate cross-reacting neutralizing antibodies, and lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, we used a conservative threshold for detection of neutralizing antibodies (90%) and we considered homotypic serologic responses to be the most reliable, as these samples reacted with just one of the 12 viruses employed in the tests, with no indication of cross-reaction. In the present study, serological evidence of ILHV, SLEV, WNV, CPCV and ROCV circulation was detected in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of Pantanal. Nhecolândia is the second largest sub-region of Pantanal comprising roughly 27,000 square-km or 19% of the total Pantanal area and it is the world’s largest and most diverse area of subtropical lakes [40], [41]. Nabileque is the fifth largest sub-region comprising roughly 14,000 square-km or 10% of the total Pantanal area. This sub- region is formed by fluvial plains of the Paraguay River and remains flooded for nine months or more during the year [42]. The seroprevalence of ILHV and all flaviviruses combined increased with age in equines (Figure 3). This temporal pattern implies low-level enzootic transmission, where risk of infection increases with time. A drop in seroprevalence in the oldest age category that was observed consistently for all the flaviviruses evaluated may be explained by either waning of detectable antibodies over time, and/or weakening of the humoral immune response in older animals. In the case of SLEV and WNV, seroprevalence appeared to increase with age in the youngest three age categories, through age 9 years old, but the sample sizes were insufficient to detect a statistically significant trend. These increases in the youngest age groups may be explained by one or more introductions with establishment or not of these viruses after 2000 (i.e. within 9 years of the sampling time point in 2009– Table 3.

This finding corroborates the negative results found in a serosurvey conducted with local equines in the 1990s, when no neutralizing antibodies for SLEV were detected [24]. These data also corroborate the results of two other equine serosurveys conducted in the Nhecolândia Sub-region in February 2007 and February 2009, when neutralizing antibodies to SLEV were detected in three and four year old equines, respectively, which suggests that SLEV circulated between 2004–2007 [25] and 2005– 2009 [21], coinciding with two human outbreaks caused by SLEV in Argentina in 2005 [43] and southeast Brazil in 2006 [4]. In the present study, the detection of SLEV- and ILHV- seropositive geldings both born in September 26, 2009 and sampled on September 30, 2010 with no history of travel outside of Pantanal indicates that the transmission of SLEV and ILHV had occurred as recently as late 2009 or 2010. The enzootic status of ILHV is corroborated by the concurrent isolation of ILHV from Aedes scapularis specimens captured in the Nhecolândia Sub-region in 2010 [44]. Regarding WNV, the youngest seropositive equine was a 2 year-old untamed mare with no history of travel. Because it was sampled on October 23, 2009, the infection occurred between 2007 and 2009. The confirmed WNV-seropositive equines were detected in ten ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,500 square-km in the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located in MS. Monotypic neutralizing reactions for WNV were detected in six ranches encompassing roughly 1,300 square-km, which com- prise approximately 20% of the Nhecolândia Sub-region area. WNV-seropositive equines were detected in Nhecolândia and Nabileque ranches located roughly 90 and 100 km distant from the city of Corumbá, MS respectively (Figure 2). Considering the detection of arbovirus activity in the Nabileque Sub-region which borders Bolivia and Paraguay, these two countries should consider our findings for their arbovirus surveillance programs. The two CPCV-seropositive equines were sampled October 20, 2009 at five years of age and no history of travel outside of Pantanal, which indicates that infection had occurred between 2004 and 2009. We report here for the first time the detection of ROCV- neutralizing antibodies in the Pantanal region. ROCV, which is an indigenous Brazilian flavivirus, was the causative agent of an extensive encephalitis epidemic in southeastern Brazil in the 1970s [3]. The detection of neutralizing antibodies for ROCV was unexpected, as current transmission events for ROCV are rare. Considering that the only ROCV-seropositive equine had no birth date available, the timing of ROCV transmission could not be clarified. No ROCV-seropositive equines were detected in two previous serosurveys for flaviviruses conducted in the same region [21], [24], which could indicate low circulation or recent introduction of ROCV in the Pantanal. No seropositivity for BSQV, IGUV, YFV and DENVs was confirmed among the equines tested in the present study. However, except for DENV-3, neutralizing antibodies were found to all the flaviviruses tested. More investigation is needed to understand the potential circulation of these viruses in the Pantanal region, as they may be restricted to ecological cycles for which equines, sheep and caiman fail to serve as indicators. A serosurvey of non-human primates and/or local human residents would be more instructive for these flaviviruses. Testing only equines may provide a biased view of the relative amounts of flavivirus transmission because equines may not mount immune responses to all viruses equally, or they may not attract all vectors equally. For example, they failed to generate primary immune responses to DENV-2 and SLEV [45] and would not attract large numbers of the yellow fever vector mosquitoes, which are primate specialists [46]. However, they are frequently exposed to mosquitoes and often utilized for arbovirus serosurveys elsewhere. Figure 3.

Regarding the 36 equines collected from ranch PV in the Nabileque Sub-region of Pantanal after a neurologic disorder outbreak occurred in 2009 and 2010, no serological evidence was found linking this epizootic to WNV, which is currently the only flavivirus known to be involved in outbreaks of equine neurological disorders in the New World. Three of four survivors of the recent neurologic syndrome had elevated titers for SLEV, and one was the highest SLEV titer detected in the herd, suggesting that the etiologic agent was a flavivirus that triggered a boost of pre-existing SLEV antibody or that SLEV infection may have been associated with the neurologic syndrome as a contributing risk factor perhaps through antibody enhancement. Equines experimentally infected with SLEV have not developed overt disease [47]. However, the possibility that a novel equine- Table 4.

SLEV genotype VB was recently isolated from the brain of a single horse that died of encephalitis in the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil, in March 2009 [48]. Of the 36 equines tested from ranch PV, 11 (30.6%) were confirmed seropositive for SLEV, the highest seropositivity compared to 13 other ranches where SLEV-seropositive equines were found (and where maximum seroprevalence was 14%) and significantly higher than SLEV seropositivity detected in all Nhecolândia equines combined (48/724, 6.6%) (p,0.001, chi- square test). The true SLEV infection rate is probably underes- timated, as several probable SLEV infections could not be differentiated due to masking by cross-reactive antibodies. Ecological differences between Nabileque and Nhecolândia sub- regions, the former formed by fluvial plains of the Paraguay River and the latter mainly comprised of savannah with subtropical lakes, may have contributed to the difference of seroprevalence encountered in these two sub-regions. Also, the Nabileque ranch is the largest ranch sampled encompassing a 900-square-km area, including portions of the plateau bordering the Pantanal. The high seropositivity for SLEV in Nabileque ranch may reflect higher circulation of SLEV in the plateau surrounding Pantanal than in the floodplains of Pantanal. Amphibians and reptiles may play a larger role in the transmission cycle of arboviruses than previously assumed. Because of their high energy conversion efficiency, ectotherms typically represent a large portion of the vertebrate biomass in many ecosystems, and may therefore greatly influence transmis- sion dynamics, either as virus amplifiers or dilution hosts [49]. Juvenile Alligator mississippiensis has been shown to develop sufficient WNV viremia to infect blood-feeding mosquitoes [50], [51]. A recent study reported the first evidence of WNV exposure in wild Morelet’s crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) in Mexico [52]. Because of widespread, high prevalence of the yacare caiman (Caiman crocodilus yacare) in the Brazilian Pantanal, about 3.9 million non-hatchling caimans in 1993 [53], and its potential to naturally amplify WNV in the region, in February of 2009 a serosurvey for flaviviruses was conducted with 30 free-ranging caimans and all animals tested negative for flavivirus antibodies. Despite the negative results, in the same study equines temporally and spatially associated with the seronegative caimans showed neutralizing antibodies for ILHV, SLEV, WNV and CPCV [21]. Taking into account these data, in the present study a wider serosurvey for flaviviruses was conducted with 61 free-ranging caimans from the Nhecolândia Sub-region, but all caimans tested negative for flavivirus antibodies by blocking ELISA and also by PRNT90 for WNV. The absence of serological evidence of flavivirus circulation in caimans was unexpected. Possible explanations for these findings are: (i) low circulation of flavivirus in caimans, (ii) caimans may not mount immune responses to flaviviruses and, finally, (iii) caimans may not attract local mosquito vectors of flaviviruses. In a study conducted also in the Pantanal, but in a different sub- region, 80% of mosquitoes caught blood-feeding on caimans were Culex (Melanoconion) theobaldi and Mansonia spp. [54], species that are not usually reported as flavivirus vectors. However, more recently, ILHV was isolated from Aedes scapularis, which was the most prevalent species caught landing or blood-feeding on caimans from the Nhecolândia Sub-region [44]. The absence of serological evidence of flavivirus circulation in sheep by blocking ELISA and the detection of only two samples with neutralizing antibodies for WNV in very low titers was also an unexpected result, considering that the tested sheep were temporally and spatially associated with equines that were seropositive for various flaviviruses. However, reports of serolog- ical evidence of WNV infection in sheep are scarce and have been showing low prevalence [55], [56]. Possible explanations for these findings are the low prevalence of Brazilian flaviviruses in sheep, or that sheep fail to develop antibodies for Brazilian flaviviruses following exposure by mosquito bite, or finally, that sheep may not attract local mosquito flavivirus vectors in the Pantanal region. An entomological study conducted in southeast Brazil in the 1980s showed that sheep was not an attractive host for mosquitoes compared with man, horse and cattle [57]. Conclusion In the present study, serological evidence of ILHV, SLEV, WNV, CPCV and ROCV circulation was detected in equines of the Pantanal. Severe disease has been linked to these viruses in humans [7], [13], [43], [58], [59] and for WNV also in equines [60]. WNV and SLEV circulation in the Pantanal appears to be a recent phenomenon. In the last three decades, the Pantanal has been impacted by the conversion of natural vegetation into agricultural fields and cattle pasture, with alteration and loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. Moreover, major negative impacts occur in uplands, with drastic deforestation of savanna vegetation, where main rivers feeding the Pantanal have their springs [22], [61]. These environmental changes in the Pantanal environs can directly impact the fluctuations of vector and vertebrate host populations, which could affect arbovirus trans- mission dynamics in the region. Loss of wetlands and other natural habitats typically leads to reduced biodiversity, and consequently increased risk of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases [62]. Preserving large wetland areas sustains biodiversity and may represent a valuable ecosystem-based approach for controlling WNV outbreaks [63]. Indeed, an outbreak of neurologic disease among equines reported herein occurred in a ranch that encompasses drier plateau ecosystem on the periphery of the Pantanal wetlands. Serology data suggest that an unknown flavivirus closely related to SLEV or a newly recognized equine- virulent strain of SLEV may be associated with this neurologic syndrome. Considering the highly conservative criteria used in the present study, the detection of seropositive equines for ILHV, SLEV, WNV, CPCV and ROCV is strong evidence for local circulation of these flaviviruses in the Pantanal of MS, Brazil. These flaviviruses should be included as differential diagnosis in future flavivirus serosurveys to be held in the region. For PRNT studies, not only these flaviviruses, but also YFV, BSQV and IGUV should be included. It appears that WNV circulated recently in the Pantanal. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in at least ten ranches is strong evidence of recent widespread circulation, but not necessarily establishment of WNV in the region. Circulation of WNV in this area has not yet been confirmed by virus isolation. Because detection of antibodies is indirect evidence of flavivirus circulation and because novel flaviviruses may exist in the region, we encourage efforts to isolate viruses to confirm the circulation of these flaviviruses. In future investigations of equine epizootics, efforts should be concentrated on the collection of samples suitable for viral isolation.

Second St., Pomona, CA 91767 Abstract: We evaluated the prevalence of WNV and SLEV neutralizing antibodies in captive and free-ranging raptors from Argentina by plaque-reduction neutralization test. Eighty plasma samples from 12 species were analyzed. Only one captive adult Crowned Eagle (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus) was WNV seropositive (preva- lence: 1.25%; antibody titer of 1:80). Two captive Crowned Eagles were SLEV seropositive (prevalence: 2.50%; antibody titers: 1:80 and 1:40).These findings expand the geographic distribution of WNV and SLEV and confirm their activity in central and northeastern Argentina. West Nile virus activity in Argentina may rep- resent a potential threat to Crowned Eagles and other endangered raptors in this country. Keywords: West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, neutralizing antibodies, raptors, Argentina Since its arrival to North America in 1999 and subsequent dissemination through Central and South America (Nash et al. 2001; Komar and Clark 2006; Diaz et al. 2008; Pet- ersen and Hayes 2008; Hunsperger et al. 2009), concern has been raised about the possible effect of West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) on immunologically naı̈ve and endangered Neotropical birds populations (Saggese 2007; Blitvich 2008; Bataille et al. 2009). Raptors (Orders Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, and Estrigiformes) are particularly susceptible to WNV infection (Wünschmann et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010). High morbidity and mortality of raptors has been reported in the USA, Canada, and Europe (Gancz et al. 2004; Saito et al. 2007; Höfle et al. 2008; Nemeth et al. 2007, 2009). Different studies conducted in experimentally inoculated birds and also on free-ranging raptors show a gradient of no obvious illness, subclinical, clinical manifestation, and death across raptors infected with WNV (Nemeth et al. 2006; Ellis et al. 2007; Jiménez-Clavero et al. 2008; Ziegler et al. 2013).Published online: August 9, 2014 Correspondence to: Miguel D.

Combined with other well-recognized threats, avian pathogens may have a negative impact on wild raptor populations (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Those species with limited geographic distribution, reduced natural numbers, fragmented populations, and low heterozygosis are highly susceptible to the deleterious effects of emerging diseases, like WNV (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Threa- tened and non-threatened species of raptors maintained in zoos and rehabilitation centers for ex situ conservation programs may be at risk as well (Saggese 2007). WNV activity was detected in several central and northern Argentinian provinces, evidenced by the detection of neutralizing antibodies (PRNTAb), in a large mosaic of avian species, starting in the early 2000s (Diaz et al. 2008, 2011). Although no human encephalitis outbreak by WNV was reported, sporadic febrile human cases were observed. Beyond these few pieces of information, data surrounding distribution and impact of WNV in South America are scarce (Komar and Clark 2006; Morales et al. 2006; Peter- sen and Hayes 2008; Diaz et al. 2008). Another flavivirus co-circulating and re-emerging in the American continent is St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Spinsanti et al. 2009), which is broadly distributed in subtropical and temperate areas of Argentina (Dı́az et al. 2013). Although birds are not affected by SLEV infection, they have an essential role in the transmission and main- tenance of this virus (Reisen 2003). The presence of WNV activity in Argentina may rep- resent a considerable potential threat to both free-ranging and captive birds (Saggese 2007). However, the pattern of WNV and SLEV infection in Argentinean raptors remains basically unknown. In this study we evaluated the preva- lence of WNV and SLEV antibodies in captive and free- ranging birds of prey from Argentina. Sampling was conducted between March 2007 and April 2010 at selected zoos and wildlife rehabilitation centers and free-ranging raptors located in different geo- graphic areas of Argentina (Table 1). Plasma samples were tested for specific SLEV and WNV antibodies by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using autochthonous viral strains (WNV ArE/ 729906 or SLEV CbaAr-4005). The etiologic agent responsible for the infection was identified in serum diluted at least 1/10 following Diaz et al. (2008). A total of 80 plasma samples from 12 species of Ac- cipitriformes, 5 species of Falconiformes, and 4 species of Estrigiformes were analyzed. Only monotypic immuno- logical reactions were detected, no cross-reaction between viruses was observed. Only one sample was WNV sero- positive (prevalence: 1.25%; 1/80), an adult Crowned Eagle (antibody titer: 1:80) (Table 1) held captive in Casa Grande, Córdoba in January 2008 (Fig. 1). Two Crowned Eagles, one from Güira Oga, Misiones province and another one from Buenos Aires city, had detectable NTAb against SLEV (titers: 1:80 and 1:40, respectively). Overall, the prevalence of SLEV NTAb was 2.50% (2/80). The adult Crowned Eagle WNV seropositive was a captive bird housed with other birds of prey in an open-air aviary located in a rural-suburban environment of the Dry Chaco Eco region. Interestingly, a few days before sam- pling, an adult Crowned Eagle housed in the same aviary was found dead, although necropsy and additional post- mortem investigation were not pursued by the zoo. This finding confirms exposure in an endangered species, ex- pands the geographic distribution of WNV, and confirms its activity within Cordoba province (Diaz et al. 2008). Cordoba city, 81 km away, was the nearest site of WNV activity previously reported in raptors: an American kestrel (Falco sparverius) had been previously found seropositive, with a bird community seroprevalence of 1.1% between January 2005 and June 2006 (Dı́az et al. 2011), 2 years before our result reported here. At the moment, the others birds of prey seropositive for WNV in Argentina come from another American kestrel and a Rufous-thighed Hawk (Accipiter erythronemius), from a rural area of Northeastern Cordoba province and from an urban site of Tucuman province, respectively (Dı́az et al. 2011). The apparent absence of WNV activity in sampled raptors could be a result of the limited sampling size in some sites. However, a relatively large number of raptors tested in Misiones (33 individuals/17 species) were also negative. The lack of WNV seropositive birds in Misiones province is surprising considering recent reports of WNV activity in the closer Corrientes and Chaco provinces, where free-ranging black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) had a seroprevalence of 19.81% in 2010 (Morales et al. 2011). Furthermore, this lack of exposure could indicate a high susceptibility to future infection and a potential conservation risk for endangered captive and free-ranging raptors inhabiting Misiones.

Quaglia et al. the largest captive collections of forest eagles in Argentina and these birds have a high value for ex situ conservation programs. Contrasting with the WNV activity in USA and Canada, no mortality events have been reported in Neotropical birds (Komar and Clark 2006; Dı́az et al. 2011). Reasons for this difference are not clearly understood, but circulation of bird- attenuated viral strains, avian host WNV infection resistant, co-circulation of antigenically related flaviviruses, and dilu- tion effect of viral activity in a richer mosquito and avian community have been suggested (Gubler 2007; Swaddle and Calos 2008; Keesing et al. 2010). Moreover, lack of a proper surveillance system could likely encrypt the actual WNV activity in the region (Petersen and Hayes 2008). One adult Crowned Eagle SLEV seropositive was a captive female in Güira Oga for more than 12 years and Figure 1. Spatial distribution of WNV and SLEV seropositive and seronegative raptors in Argentina, 2007–2010. WNV and SLEV Seroprevalence in Raptors, Argentina 607 sampled in March 2008. Based on its antibody titer of 1:80 we suspect that SLEV infection was recently acquired. Hodara et al. (1991) described SLEV seropositive people when studying prevalence of several arthropod-borne dis- eases in Misiones province, but technical limitations of their work precluded conclusions about the exact identity of the specific antibodies (a non-specific hemagglutination inhibition test was used by these investigators). Therefore, this is the first confirmation of SLEV activity in this province. The other SLEV positive Crowned Eagle was a juvenile found in San Juan province (western Argentina) and moved to Buenos Aires for rehabilitation 2 months before the sampling date (April 2009). The low titer (1:40) and the history of recent movement suggests two potential sce- narios for the infection origin. Between January and May 2009, a SLEV case was registered in Buenos Aires (López et al. 2011) suggesting infection of this bird may have oc- curred during this time. Alternatively, if this eagle was in- fected in San Juan before its arrival in Buenos Aires, this would demonstrate viral circulation at least 2 years previ- ous to a recent urban outbreak (López et al. 2011). Unfortunately, no other birds were investigated for SLEV NTAb. Recently, the use of zoo collections and rescue centers has been advocated for disease surveillance (Nemeth et al. 2007; Pultorak et al. 2011). In Argentina, human health surveillance programs are designed to report encephalitis and fever syndromes with infrequent etiological confir- mation, although prophylactic measures are rarely imple- mented as result. Raptors, and other species of birds, are highly susceptible to WNV and SLEV infection (Wünsch- mann et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010) mounting an antibody response to detectable levels by serological tests such as ELISA and PRNT (Nemeth et al. 2007). Zoo and rehabilitation centers house a large number of birds from different orders including raptors, parrots, waterfowl, etc. that could constitute an excellent, sensitive, and operative source of biomedical samples for WNV and SLEV activity surveillance (Nemeth et al. 2007; Pultorak et al. 2011). Our data confirm the endemic circulation of WNV in the province of Cordoba, according with previous evidence and suggest a wide geographic distribution of SLEV and WNV in Argentina (Diaz et al. 2008). Our limited sample size did not allow confirming the absence of viral activity in raptors at locations where only seronegative birds were found, potentially underestimating the real infection status of raptors at the present time. However, this represents the first screening for flavivirus serological status in birds of prey at a large spatial scale in Argentina and South America. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank D. Ramadori, H.

Reisen-2016-Surveys for antibodies against mos.pdf	VBZ-2015-1888-ver9-Reisen_3P 264..282 Surveys for Antibodies Against Mosquitoborne Encephalitis Viruses in California Birds, 1996–2013 William K. Reisen and Sarah S. Wheeler* Abstract From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds comprising 152 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and released at four study areas within California, from which 28,388 additional serum samples were collected at one or more recapture encounters. Of these, 142, 99, and 1929 birds from 41 species were positive for neutralizing antibodies against western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), or West Nile virus (WNV) at initial capture or recapture, respectively. Overall, 83% of the positive serum samples were collected from five species: House Finch, House Sparrow, Mourning Dove, California Quail, and Western Scrub-Jay. Temporal data supported concurrent arbovirus surveillance and documented the disappearance of birds positive for WEEV in 2008 and SLEV in 2003 and the appearance of birds positive for WNV after its invasion in 2003. Results of these serosurveys agreed well with the host selection patterns of the Culex vectors as described from bloodmeal sequencing data and indicated that transmission of WNV seemed most effective within urban areas where avian and mosquito host diversity was limited to relatively few competent species. Key Words: Avian banding—Avian serology—St. Louis encephalitis virus—Western equine encephalomyelitis virus—West Nile virus. Introduction The mosquitoborne encephalitis viruses, includingwestern equine encephalomyelitis virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus, WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (Flavivir- idae, Flavivirus, SLEV), and West Nile virus (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus, WNV), were or are now endemic to California. WEEV originally was isolated in 1930 from a horse that succumbed from encephalitis in Merced County during a large epizootic of equine disease in the Central Valley of California (Meyer et al. 1931). SLEV was recognized as a cause of summer encephalitis in residents of the San Joaquin Valley in 1937 (Howitt 1939), soon after its initial isolation in Missouri (Muckenfuss et al. 1934). Both viruses remained active each summer in the Central Valley, where they were an important public and veterinary health concern through the 1980s, with enzootic and occasional epidemic-level trans- mission (Reeves et al. 1990). Subsequently, the activity of both viruses declined in the Central Valley (Reisen et al. 1990), with the exception of a small SLEV outbreak of hu- man disease in the San Joaquin Valley in 1989 (Reisen et al. 1992b) and widespread zoonotic transmission of WEEV in the Sacramento Valley in 1993 (Reisen et al. 1995a). An outbreak of SLEV also was documented in Los Angeles in 1984 (Murray et al. 1985), with continued low-level enzootic transmission (Work et al. 1985, Reisen et al. 1992c) recorded occasionally through 2003. Enzootic transmission of WEEV and SLEV was documented consistently in the southeastern deserts of California from 1967 through 2003 (Meylan et al. 1989, Reisen et al. 1992a, 1996c, Reisen et al. 2002), with infrequent human disease (Reisen et al. 1996a, Reisen and Chiles 1997). Although enzootic WEEV transmission was detected briefly in 2005–2007, SLEV essentially disappeared from California from 2004 through 2013. WNV invaded California through the southeastern deserts during 2003 (Reisen et al. 2004), just 5 years after being discovered in New York City (Lanciotti et al. 1999), spread to every county in the state by the end of 2004 (Hom et al. 2004), and has remained continually active since this time, with human disease detected annually (Feiszli et al. 2013). WEEV and SLEV were not detected in mosquitoes from 2007 and 2003, respectively, through 2013, despite the continued Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Vectorborne Diseases, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California. *Current affiliation: Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, California.

Widespread vaccination and natural immunization have limited the number of equine cases of both WEEV and WNV diseases reported annually. The cascade of events that have led to the above transitions in arbovirus activity remain unclear, although the California landscape has changed dramatically since the 1930s. The state human population has grown from ca. 7M in 1930 to 37M by 2010, with extensive urbanization of the Los Angeles Basin and the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley. Ex- tensive intermittent wetlands of the Central Valley have been converted to farmland, and vernal runoff is now managed by engineering projects along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. Concurrently agricultural production has risen from $7.3 billion in 1974 to $45 billion/year in 2011, even though some of the original farmland was converted to housing. This increase in farm production followed the completion of the extensive Central Valley Water Project bringing Sacramento River water into the arid west side of the San Joaquin Valley through several major canal systems and to Los Angeles through the California Aqueduct (www.water.ca.gov/swp/ cvp.cfm, accessed 30 Aug 2015). Agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley transitioned from cotton and fodder to carrots, grapes, almonds, and dairy production. Following an exten- sive drought in the 1980s, farming practices such as tailwater recycling and laser leveling were adopted to conserve water. Collectively, these changes to the California landscape al- tered mosquito and avian populations and impacted arbovirus epidemiology (Reeves and Milby 1989). In addition, the epidemics that followed the invasion of California by WNV resulted in the expansion and improvement of mosquito control programs. Birds are the vertebrate hosts for these three encephalitis viruses and therefore have been studied intensively since their role in transmission was discovered in the 1940s (Hammon et al. 1943). Extensive field studies during 1946– 1951 in Kern County carefully characterized bird commu- nities in rural, agrarian, and periurban habitats, documented their seasonality and migration status, and described their nesting habits (McClure et al. 1962). A subset of these birds were tested for antibodies using a mouse protection neutral- ization assay, of which 17% (n = 1147) and 9% (n = 1039) were positive for WEEV and SLEV antibodies, respectively (Reeves and Hammon 1962). Of the bird species tested, House Finches, House Sparrows, and Bullock’s Orioles were positive most frequently. The adaptation of the hemaggluti- nation inhibition assay allowed for rapid and extensive test- ing of wild birds to detect the prevalence antibodies. During 1952–1973 in Kern County and 1969–1973 in Butte and Glenn Counties, a total of 14,713 blood samples from 131 species of wild birds were tested for antibodies, of which 4% were positive for WEEV and 3% for SLEV, respectively (Milby and Reeves 1990), a marked decline from the previ- ous survey, although resident peridomestic passerines again emerged as the most frequently infected species. Our studies on the role of birds in the ecology of arbo- viruses commenced at wetlands along the Salton Sea in the Coachella Valley in 1996, following our discovery that WEEV and SLEV seemed to overwinter in this area and then disperse upland in the Coachella Valley (Reisen et al. 1995b, 1995c) and perhaps to other areas of California. The com- bination of agricultural, desert, and wetland habitats in this area along the Pacific Flyway has enabled one of the most diverse avifauna in North America, with >380 species listed at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (www.fws.gov/ refuge/Sonny_Bono_Salton_Sea/wildlife_and_habitat/index .html, accessed 19 Nov 2015). We were interested to deter- mine which of these species were infected most frequently, may disseminate virus elsewhere, and how these results re- lated to our understanding of mosquito host-seeking behav- ior (Lothrop and Reisen 2001), host selection (Thiemann et al. 2012, Reisen et al. 2013a), and arboviral amplification. For comparison, similar studies were initiated in Kern County in 1997 at some of the same collection sites used previously by McClure and colleagues (Milby and Reeves 1990), allowing us to investigate the impact of landscape change in the San Joaquin Valley on antibody seroprevalence within the avian community. After the arrival of WNV, ad- ditional sampling was initiated at urban habitats in Los An- geles in 2003 (Kwan et al. 2012) and at suburban and rural FIG. 1.

Data summarized from the State of California Arbo- virus Surveillance Program show consistent activity of WEEV and SLEV until after the invasion of California by WNV in 2003 (Hui et al. 1999, Steinlein et al. 2003).

ANTIBODIES AGAINST ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES IN CALIFORNIA BIRDS 265 habitats at the city of Davis in the Sacramento Valley (un- published data). The current article summarizes data on birds that became infected and survived to produce antibody and therefore compliments our recent article on those birds that succumbed during infection and were tested as part of the dead bird surveillance program for WNV (Foss et al. 2015). Materials and Methods Bird collection areas were selected near wetlands around the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, Riverside County, in the San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield, Kern County, and in the Sacramento Valley near Davis, Yolo County, and at multiple urban sites throughout Los Angeles. The locations of fre- quently used collection sites are summarized in Table 1. Additional sites were tried and then discontinued because of low collection success, vandalism, or other logistical reasons. Multiple net lanes and bird trap sites were tried at each lo- cation until productive positions were selected for repeated sampling. For netting, three sites at each of the three areas were selected each season and sampled on two consecutive days during each 2-week period, depending upon weather. Each site contained from 7 to 15 mist net locations and multiple small and large grain-baited traps, except for Los Angeles sites where a single modified crow trap was operated at each of seven fixed sites. Mist nets were mostly 2.6 · 12 meters with 38-mm mesh (some with 60-mm mesh were used to collect large birds) and were operated starting at dawn for 3–5 h each day, depending upon catch size and weather. Australian crow traps with drop-in top slits modified for sparrows and/or walk-in bottom cone entrances (McClure 1984) were baited with mixed wild birdseed and water and operated for 24 h for 2 days at each location during each sampling rotation. Additional bird serum samples were col- lected opportunistically, including samples from waterfowl at the Kern NWR during an avian cholera outbreak, birds taken to wildlife rehabilitation centers, heron chicks sampled at a heronry near Davis, and birds taken under depredation permits by aquiculture, pigeon, and vineyard bird removal programs. Birds were identified to species and aged using plumage and/or skull ossification (Pyle 1997) and banded using ap- propriate USGS bands (www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/). Some species such as quail and pigeons were not provided federal bands; these species were either not banded or banded with non-USGS sequentially numbered plastic or aluminum bands (National Band and Tag; Newport, NY). A 0.05 or 0.1 mL blood sample (depending on bird size) was taken by jugular venipuncture using a 0.5-mL tuberculin syringe with a 28 g needle and immediately diluted with 0.9 mL saline; some pigeons and doves were sampled from the brachial vein. Birds recaptured on consecutive days were immediately re- leased and not resampled. Samples were clarified by centrifugation and then stored at -20�C until screened for antibody by an enzyme immuno- assay (EIA) using a conjugated anti-bird detector antibody (Chiles and Reisen 1998, Ebel et al. 2002) produced com- mercially in goats by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Mon- tgomery, TX). Each sample was tested in three wells using a 96-well plate format—two wells with crude viral antigen and one without antigen. Separate plates were precoated with WEEV or SLEV antigen. Using this EIA, birds experimen- tally infected with WNV or SLEV produced antibodies equally reactive with our SLEV crude antigen (Fang and Reisen 2006), so SLEV antigen was used to screen serum samples for antibody against both flaviviruses. Samples with the ratio of the mean absorbance of the two antigen-positive wells divided by the antigen-negative well that were ‡ 2 were confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Samples were considered confirmed when endpoint titers on Vero cell culture had >90% reduction of 75–100 plaque- forming units (pfu) of WEEV, SLEV, or WNV at a dilution of ‡ 1:20. Because SLEV and WNV cross-reacted in our EIA and PRNT assays (Fang and Reisen 2006, Patiris et al. 2008), the purported infecting virus was required to produce an endpoint titer ‡ 4· the competing virus. Positive bird sam- ples were reported once and were limited to those birds with a confirming PRNT90 titer ‡ 1:20 or ‡ 4· the competing virus. Results From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds com- prising 151 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and re- leased, of which 142, 99, and 1929 individuals had serum samples with neutralizing antibodies positive against WEEV, SLEV, or WNV, respectively, at either initial capture or at one or more recapture events (Table 2). Because the number of samples required to detect a positive serum varied among birds, data are presented as the number of individual birds that were detected as positive among all birds sampled. An additional 3732 birds from 137 species were bled, but not banded, of which 16, 39, and 86 were positive for WEEV, SLEV, or WNV, respectively (Table 3). These latter samples came from birds that were not authorized for USGS bands Table 1.

Because they were not banded, some of these birds could have been sampled more than once, confounding at- tempts to estimate prevalence of infection. Data from Tables 2 and 3 are combined in Figure 2 to show the temporal pattern of seropositive bird collections at Coachella and Kern study sites. Sample sizes reflected changes in landscape related to shore- line changes of the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley and to the flow of the Kern River in Kern County, as well as changes in our staffing and collection methods (arrows show when mist netting was terminated at each site). WEEV and SLEV anti- bodies detected during 1996–2004 in Coachella disappeared by 2005, two years after the initial detection of WNV in Ca- lifornia (Fig. 1). Low-level activity of WEEV in Kern County ended in 2001, was renewed briefly in 2005–2007, ended in 2008, and was not detected through 2013 in birds or by other surveillance methods (Figs. 1 and 2); SLEV was not detected in Kern County throughout the study period. Sampling in Los Angeles and Yolo Counties was initiated after the invasion of WNV, and neither WEEV nor SLEV antibody-positive birds were detected at these locations, agreeing with concurrent mosquito and sentinel chicken surveillance. The relatively high proportion of recaptures at these locations (Table 2) reflected the extensive use of grain- baited traps and their attractiveness for passerines; for ex- ample, one male House Sparrow was collected and bled 57 times over a 4-year period at the same trap in Los Angeles (Kwan et al. 2012). Data from Los Angeles showed marked temporal variation, with high seroprevalence associated with outbreaks of WNV disease in humans during 2004, 2008, and 2012, when WNV seroprevalence increased to as high as 45% among after hatch-year and 60% among juvenile and hatch-year House Finches and House Sparrows (Kwan et al. 2012). Peak WNV antibody positivity in Kern County during 2007 coincided with the largest outbreak of human disease in this county since the arrival of WNV in 2004 (Reisen et al. 2009a). Interestingly, few human cases of mosquitoborne encephalitis have been reported from Coachella Valley, de- spite consistent enzootic transmission of all three viruses and an elderly human population associated with several retire- ment communities. When sorted by resident status, >95% of seropositive birds and >87% of recaptures were from species classified as year- round residents (Table 4). The remaining positive birds were winter residents that likely were infected during early or late season transmission and summer residents that were infected during the transmission season. Few transient migrants coming north from Mexico or the Neotropics were seropositive, agreeing with our previous study that focused on the role of migratory birds in the movement of arboviruses through this area (Reisen et al. 2010).

Ar- rows indicate the end of mist net sampling and the reliance on grain-baited traps in periurban environments, resulting in a decline in the numbers of samples tested. 276 REISEN AND WHEELER through the Coachella Valley were summer residents in the Central Valley, and 4 of these 592 birds were seropositive. Overall, 15 of our captures were considered vagrants and were collected outside of their normal ranges in North America (<http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna>), including American Red- start, Bay-breasted Warbler, Clay-colored Sparrow, Indigo Bunting (2), Northern Waterthrush (4), Orchard Oriole, Ovenbird, Ruddy Ground Dove, Tennessee Warbler, Virginia’s Warbler, and Worm-eating Warbler (Table 2). Most vagrants were captured in Coachella Valley and all were negative for antibody. Banded birds were summarized by order (Table 5). Overall, 85% of initial captures and 82% of recaptures were in the order Passeriformes, followed by Columbiformes (mostly Mourning Doves) and Galliformes (two species of Quail). Although these latter two orders comprised <20% of the samples from original and recaptured birds, they comprised 49% of the WEEV, 73% of the SLEV, and 33% of the WNV seropositives, perhaps indicating a trend for Culex vectors to blood feed on larger- bodied birds. Adults of these columbiform and galliform birds generally were low to moderately competent hosts based on experimental infection studies (Komar et al. 2003, Reisen et al. 2003, 2005a); however, nestlings were highly competent before their immune systems became fully functional (Mahmood et al. 2004, Reisen et al. 2006c). With the exception of House Finches and House Sparrows, most of the seropositive Passeriformes were fairly large-sized birds such as Western Scrub-Jays. Other corvid species such as the American Crow and Yellow-billed Magpie were infrequently collected and frequently succumbed to WNV infection (Komar et al. 2003, Reisen et al. 2013b, Foss et al. 2015), precluding their utility in serological surveys. Another group frequently positive, but infrequently sampled, was the Pelecaniformes, including the Least Bittern and Black- crowned Night Heron. Some herons and egrets form large multispecies nesting colonies during spring and early summer that may be foci of intense virus transmission (Reisen et al. 2009b), provided these colonies did not form in trees over water (Reisen et al. 2005b). Over land, Culex mosquitoes fed fre- quently and preferentially on these birds (Thiemann et al. 2011), some of which such as Black-Crowned Night Herons produced elevated WNV viremias as nestlings. Extensive sur- veillance samples from sentinel or domestic chickens were not included in this report, but serum samples from these birds frequently were positive at all four study areas. Of the 54,546 birds banded and released, only 128 were reported to us as foreign encounters; that is, reported to the USGS Bird Banding Laboratory by individuals from outside of our research program. Of these, 90 were Mourning Doves, of which 68 were reported as shot and 15 as found dead during the hunting season and relatively near to where they were banded and released. In addition, 12 Western Scrub- Jays and 3 Yellow-billed Magpies were reported as found dead. Five birds were reported from regions outside of Ca- lifornia, including a Red-winged Blackbird banded in Ba- kersfield in 1997 and reported from Alberta, Canada, in 2001, a White-crowned Sparrow banded at the Tracy Ranch in Kern County in 2003 and reported in British Columbia in 2005, a Brown-headed Cowbird banded at the Kern NWR in 1997 and reported from Oregon in 2006, and a Western Wood Pewee banded at the Kern NWR in 1997 and reported from Nevada in 1999. In addition, a Common Yellowthroat banded in Coachella Valley in 1997 was encountered in Santa Cruz on the California Coast in 1999. Interestingly, we did not document the movement of banded birds between our study areas and made only a single foreign band recovery: a Brown- headed Cowbird netted in Lamont near Bakersfield in No- vember 2000 that was originally banded in the San Joaquin Valley (data not available). Discussion Disappearance of WEEV and SLEV Temporal trends in avian seroprevalence agreed well with results from arbovirus surveillance programs in California Table 4.

Conversely, WNV has remained active each summer after its introduction in 2003, utilizing the same mosquito vectors and generally the same avian hosts as WEEV and SLEV. SLEV reappeared in Coachella Valley, California, and Arizona during the summer of 2015 (un- published data), but WEEV has not been detected to date. Unfortunately bird sampling ceased in 2013, so the antibody status of the avian community during the reemergence of SLEV is not known. It was difficult to understand these viral displacements. Possibly very high viremia levels in susceptible avian hosts and moderate Culex vector competence for WNV provided a more effective transmission system than lower avian viremia and greater vector competence by SLEV and WEEV (Hardy and Reeves 1990b, 1990c, Reisen et al. 2005a, Maharaj et al. 2014). Although cross-immunity between SLEV and WNV was demonstrated experimentally in avian hosts (Fang and Reisen 2006, Patiris et al. 2008), SLEV seroprevalence levels in Coachella Valley during 2002 and 2003 (Reisen et al. 2008b) apparently were inadequate to impede the invasion of WNV in 2003 and then all of California by 2004. The es- tablishment of WNV was followed by the immediate and coincidental disappearance of SLEV from California and most of North America (Reisen 2014). Previous infection with WNV imparted sterilizing immunity against SLEV in House Finches (Fang and Reisen 2006) and presumably other birds, and this combined with more efficient WNV trans- mission may have contributed to the disappearance of SLEV. Coincidental with the invasion of WNV, WEEV also dis- appeared from California and North America. WEEV is an alphavirus and WNV is a flavivirus, and therefore there is no cross-immunity. These two viruses utilize many of the same avian hosts, but WEEV viremia was not impaired experi- mentally by WNV infection when birds were coinfected with both viruses (Reisen and Hahn 2007). Previously, Reeves et al. (1994) speculated that WEEV may disappear due to global climate warming. In support, the median infectious dose of WEEV required to infect field-collected Culex tar- salis was found to increase by two to three orders of mag- nitude from early spring to midsummer (Hardy et al. 1990a, Reisen et al. 1996b), perhaps indicating the negative impact of warm temperature on susceptibility to infection. However, the last location of active WEEV transmission in California was in the SE deserts, the hottest area of California, where temperatures average 3–5�C warmer than the San Joaquin Valley where WEEV was previously endemic (Reisen et al. 2006b). In addition, WEEV replicates more effectively in mosquitoes at cold temperatures than does WNV (Reisen et al. 1993, 2006b), thereby theoretically extending the transmission season. Previously, it was proposed that flood- water Aedes mosquitoes and mammals (especially Lago- morphs) composed an early season transmission cycle for WEEV that preceded the well-documented Culex–bird cycle (Burton et al. 1966, McLintock et al. 1970). However, our studies in southern California did not support this paradigm as few Aedes were found infected (Reisen 1984, Reisen et al. 1990, 1992a). In addition, we have failed to detect temporal declines in WEEV replicative fitness as indicated by exper- imental infections in mosquito or passerine hosts (Reisen et al. 2008a) or mosquito and avian cell culture systems (Zhang et al. 2011). Decreased murine neurovirulence was reported for one WEEV strain (IMP181-05) isolated from Imperial County, California, in 2005 (Logue et al. 2009). The arrival of WNV in California was accompanied by marked wildlife, veterinary, and human health impacts that raised media attention and funding levels for surveillance and mosquito control at the local and national levels. In combi- nation with several drought years during which cropping strategies were altered and irrigation practices modified to increase water-use efficiency, enhanced mosquito control perhaps reduced vector abundance below the entomological thresholds required for efficient avian infection and the am- plification of WEEV and SLEV, but not WNV. Avian host selection The presence of antibodies against arboviruses in avian hosts depends largely upon the host selection patterns of the mosquito vectors and the ability of the avian host to survive infection and produce detectable and persistent antibodies. Although Cx. tarsalis fed more frequently upon mammals than did members of the Cx. pipiens complex, both vectors blood fed frequently upon a wide variety of birds (Tempelis et al. 1965, Tempelis and Washino 1967, Molaei et al. 2010, Montgomery et al. 2011, Thiemann et al. 2011, 2012, Camp- bell et al. 2013, Reisen et al. 2013a). Related behavioral studies showed the importance of vegetative ecotones, landscape heterogeneity and composition, and mosquito flight paths during host-seeking flights on the frequency of vector–host contact (Lothrop and Reisen 2001). A striking example of the importance of landscape was the near absence of pelecaniform bloodmeals from Culex (Thiemann et al. 2012) or antibody in ardeid birds (Reisen et al. 2005b) collected in southern California, where these and other waterbirds such as gulls and cormorants nested and roosted in snags over water or on sand bars. When the same ardeid species nested in trees over land near Davis in the Central Valley, they were frequently infected with WNV (Reisen et al. 2009b) and were the preferred bloodmeal host for Culex (Thiemann et al. 2011). Based on the current serological data, previous bloodmeal analyses, and dead bird surveillance (Foss et al. 2015), larger birds such as doves, quail, and domestic chickens seemed to be selected more frequently than smaller birds such as war- blers and wrens. This agreed with the general overselection of thrushes (family Turdidae) by Culex in eastern United States (Kilpatrick 2011) and Europe (Lundstrom et al. 2001). Adult galliform and columbiform birds generally are poor to moderately competent hosts for WNV (Reisen et al. 2003, 2005a, Wheeler et al. 2009), and along with mammals, their frequent selection by host-seeking mosquitoes most likely dampened virus transmission. Conversely, the corvids (es- pecially American Crows) present an interesting conundrum because they are large-bodied periurban birds, are highly competent for North American strains of WNV and usually die from infection (Komar et al. 2003, Brault et al. 2004), and are frequently associated epidemiologically in time and space with the transmission of WNV to humans (Eidson et al. 2001, Reisen et al. 2006a, Nielsen and Reisen 2007), but seemed to be infrequently fed upon by Culex (Molaei et al. 2010, 278 REISEN AND WHEELER Thiemann et al. 2012), except under certain conditions of host availability (Thiemann et al. 2011, Campbell et al. 2013). With the exception of Western Scrub-Jays, the high mortality rate among infected corvids and their difficulty in collection made them unsuited for routine serological sampling. House Finches, House Sparrows, and perhaps Oak Titmice seemed to be outliers to this general trend in bird size, because although they are relatively small-sized birds, they frequently were fed upon by Culex (Thiemann et al. 2012), were frequently antibody positive in ser- osurveys (current and historical studies), produced viremias adequate to infect Culex (Reisen et al. 2005a, 2006b), were linked closely to viral amplification and outbreak patterns in urban settings (Kwan et al. 2012), and frequently tested positive at necropsy when found dead in nature (Foss et al. 2015). Sampling biases Although avian serology may be informative and compli- ment other surveillance measures such as infection prevalence in dead birds for tracking arbovirus activity, our sampling approach and the resulting data had multiple limitations and biases. The diversity of species collected and therefore tested was constrained by sampling. Based on historical studies, we chose to focus on mist netting and grain-baited trap collections that worked well for passeriform, galliform, and some co- lumbiform birds; however, these methods did not collect all species equally and often birds seen within our study areas were rarely collected, making us reluctant to use the numbers captured as an index of abundance. In addition, these methods did not collect potentially im- portant bird groups such as the psittaforms, anseriforms, and pelecaniforms. Many cities in California now have large resident populations of escaped psittaform birds, and New World species have been found to be highly susceptible to WNV infection (Komar 2003), but with the exception of an occasional Budgerigar, these birds were never collected by our sampling program. The role of anseriform birds in ar- bovirus amplification remains poorly understood. Although adult mallard ducks were relatively refractory to WEEV and SLEV (low viremia response), 6-day-old ducklings produced peak viremias of 3.3 to 4.3 pfu/mL and 4.4 to 6.7 pfu/mL following needle inoculation with Kern County strains of WEEV and SLEV, respectively, and produced a strong an- tibody response (unpublished data). Adult mallards infected with WNV produced a peak viremia of 6.7 pfu/mL; ducklings were not tested (Komar et al. 2003). Our few blood samples from anersiforms were taken from birds collected for other purposes and none were antibody positive. Repeated sam- pling at a heronry consisting of nesting Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, and Cattle Egrets showed frequent infection of nestlings that had fallen from nests, with elevated viremia and high antibody prevalence (Reisen et al. 2009b), but adult birds in the canopy could not be sampled. Another sampling problem precluding the estimation of prevalence was that individual birds were sampled on different numbers of occasions. This created variation in the sensitivity of detection of infection among birds within and among spe- cies. Obviously birds collected on multiple occasions over several transmission seasons would have a greater probability of being detected as antibody positive than birds collected once in a single occasion. In agreement, after hatch-year birds had a higher prevalence of infection than hatch-year birds. In addition to biases related to avian species sampling, our data also were limited to those species or individuals that became infected and survived to produce antibody and therefore may not represent infection prevalence. Although most species survive WEEV and SLEV infection (Reisen et al. 2003), many species succumb to WNV infection (Ko- mar et al. 2003, Reisen et al. 2005a, Wheeler et al. 2009). Because the mortality rate from WNV infection varied widely within and among avian species, this contributed to the difficulty in calculating and interpreting seroprevalence data. Therefore, to appreciate the range of avian involvement in WNV transmission, the current study should be compared with the results of concurrent dead bird surveillance (Foss et al. 2015) as well as experimental host competence studies (Wheeler et al. 2009). Data from foreign recapture encounters were unrewarding. Our sole foreign encounter was a single Brown-headed Cowbird. In addition, we did not encounter banded birds moving among our four study areas, even during migration periods. For example, we banded and released 7294 White- crowned Sparrows and recaptured 2788 that we banded. This winter resident arrived at our study areas during fall and departed in spring, thereby avoiding most of the virus transmission season, although some were found antibody positive for WNV. Many of the birds we collected in the San Joaquin Valley purportedly nest in Alaska (Hardy et al. 1965), a journey of over 3000 miles each way. However, they returned each fall to the exact same wintering grounds, and banded birds were never recaptured at different sampling sites. Most foreign encounters of our banded birds were by hunters during dove season: 83 of 90 encounters of Mourning Doves were shot or found dead. Overall, 12 of 12 Western Scrub-Jay reports were from dead birds that may have suc- cumbed from WNV, but were not submitted for testing. Only five birds were reported from outside of our region. These data certainly indicated the difficulty in understanding bird migration routes and survival, and the low frequency of band encounters along the Pacific Flyway. Relatively few bird species were repeatedly positive for antibodies against these three arboviruses. We sampled 152 different species of birds; however, 83% of the positive indi- viduals were from 5 key species. From a WNV epidemiolog- ical standpoint, information on cumulative seroprevalence among two peridomestic maintenance hosts (House Finches, House Sparrows) sampled by grain-baited traps seemed most informative. In Los Angeles, when herd immunity or the proportion of antibody-positive birds collected during Janu- ary–March was >20%, the probability of a summer outbreak of human disease was low (Kwan et al. 2012), and these data now are used for early season planning by local mosquito control agencies. In contrast, our attempts to establish similar trapping programs at our Kern County and Coachella Valley study areas were less successful because we failed to establish high trap collection success and trap fidelity (Fig. 2), and seroprevalence rates in these species generally were not predictive of virus amplification (Reisen et al. 2008b, 2009a). Passive surveil- lance using dead birds reported by the public seemed to be a more cost-effective and efficient method of monitoring WNV activity (Foss et al. 2015). ANTIBODIES AGAINST ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES IN CALIFORNIA BIRDS 279 The intensive and widespread enzootic transmission of WNV to birds and improved genetic methods of bloodmeal host identification provided a more extensive appreciation of encephalitis virus transmission patterns in California than could be extracted from studies when there was low-level activity of WEEV and SLEV. Although these viruses occa- sionally infected a wide range of avian hosts, only a few species seemed critical for maintaining transmission, and the simplification of diversity in periurban landscapes allowed effective virus amplification to outbreak levels. As suggested previously (Reeves and Hammon 1962), key avian species were abundant and widespread during the summer trans- mission season in habitats frequented by questing Culex, frequently survived infection, produced elevated viremias following infection with small amounts of virus, had a high reproductive or replacement rate ensuring a continued num- ber of immunologically naı̈ve birds, and were fed upon frequently by Culex vector species. In California, House Finches, House Sparrows, and Western Scrub-Jays seemed to best fit these criteria, although comparable adequate data were not available on all other possible species.

DOI: 10.1089/vbz.2006.0626 West Nile Virus Circulation Detected in Northern Italy in Sentinel Chickens ANNAPAOLA RIZZOLI,1 ROBERTO ROSÀ,1 FAUSTA ROSSO,1 ALAN BUCKLEY,2 and ERNEST GOULD2 ABSTRACT Ninety percent (56/62) of sentinel chickens introduced to two regions within the Italian Alps seroconverted to West Nile virus (WNV) during the summer of 2005, showing a range of antibody titres from 1/20 to 1/320 in a virus neu- tralization test. Neutralization specificity for WNV antibodies was confirmed on an additional 34 sera that were tested in parallel against WNV (16/34 seropositivity), Usutu virus (3/34 seropositivity) and Koutango virus. The geometric mean neutralizing titre (GMT) calculated for WN-specific antibodies was 33.68 and did not differ sig- nificantly amongst sample sites, although the overall results indicate more active circulation of WNV at the higher elevations. Such high levels of seroconversion raise the possibility that many chickens may have been exposed to virus via routes other than mosquito transmission. No chickens or any other local animals were associated with illness due to WNV implying that WNV, and to a much lower extent Usutu virus, circulate harmlessly amongst wildlife species in northern Italy from late May onwards until early autumn.

The virus is carried to Europe by birds that migrate be- tween Africa, Asia and Europe. It is transmit- ted to non-migratory resident birds and mam- malian hosts by ornithophilic mosquitoes such as Culex spp. (Hubalek and Halouzka 1999, Malkinson and Banet 2002, Gould et al. 2001, Buckley et al. 2003). Although WNV has been shown to be pathogenic for humans and a wide range of mammalian and bird species (Mc- Clean et al. 2002), in the Old World it appears to circulate relatively harmlessly, as demon- strated by the detection of antibodies in a num- ber of healthy avian species (Gould et al. 2006, Buckley et al. 2006). However, outbreaks of West Nile fever have been recorded in several European and Mediterranean countries during the last decades, including Romania, Russia, Is- rael and Italy (Murgue et al. 2002, Autorino et al. 2002). The introduction of WNV to North America in 1999 (Jia et al. 1999, Lanciotti et al. 1999, Roehrig et al. 2002) led to widespread epi- demics that currently do not appear to be re- ceding in intensity. Despite the enormous num- ber of publications on WNV epidemiology, relatively little is known of the ecology and nat- ural history of WNV transmission in Europe, and most WNV outbreaks in humans and ani- mals remain unpredictable and difficult to con- trol (Dauphin et al. 2005). The unexpected ap- pearance of Usutu virus (USUV) causing fatal infections in birds in Austria in 2000 (Weis- senbock et al. 2001) and the occasional cases of WNV in horses in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002) 1Centre for Alpine Ecology, Trento, Italy. 2Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, United Kingdom.

Thus, early detection of virus activity in animals, and analysis of the ecolog- ical conditions that characterise WNV-active geographic regions would be useful to devise disease monitoring and early warning systems. The Trentino-Alto Adige region of northern Italy is located under one of the important bird migratory routes across the Alps between Africa and Europe. To assess whether or not WNV circulates in this area and the period of its major activity, we monitored WNV-specific seroconversion in sentinel chickens placed on open ground during the summer of 2005. The use of sentinel chickens is known to be a cost- effective and non-invasive alternative to the use of wildlife species for detecting WNV cir- culation (Buckley et al. 2006) and is used fre- quently throughout North America to monitor the presence of this virus. METHODS Fifty-two hand-reared 2-week-old chicks were placed in two different fenced open areas with other farm birds on May 4 until August 28, 2005. Fourteen of these chicks were lost by predation during the sampling period. Serum was collected fortnightly from each chicken; it was clarified by centrifugation and stored at �20°C. One site was located in Fiemme Valley (Tesero, altitude 997 m above sea level) a mountainous area of the Dolomites where the mean annual temperature is 7.65°C, and the to- tal annual rainfall is 688.6 mm (Fig. 1). The sec- ond site (Pietramurata, altitude 549 m above sea level) was located in the Lake Valley dis- trict, an area characterized by the presence of lakes, with a mean annual temperature during 2005 of 9.88°C and a total annual rainfall of 854.2 mm. An additional 10 chicks were placed in Cavedine, located near Pietramurata site, on June 21, 2005. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to an African strain of WNV (WN-DAK) using the 50% plaque re- duction neutralization test (PRNT50) described previously (Buckley et al. 2003, 2006). All plaque reduction tests were performed blind; the sera were numbered in Italy with no indi- cation of their identity and they were tested in Oxford, UK. The results were subsequently de- coded in Italy. The number of seroconverting sentinel chick- ens (i.e., with a titer � 1/20) was estimated at fortnightly intervals. The geometric mean anti- body titer (GMT) was calculated for PRNT50 as described in Thrusfield (2005). To confirm WNV antibody specificity, the sera of an addi- tional 34 adult chickens kept on the same farms and having similar exposure to mosquitoes and migratory birds during the years 2005 and 2006 were collected during August 2006. These sera were multi-tested using PRNT50 against the lin- eage 1 (WN-DAK) strain of WNV (Lanciotti et al. 2002) and closely related Usutu virus (USUV) and Koutango virus (KOUV). Statistical analysis To assess differences in titers among sites, we performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS Table 1 presents a summary of the PRNT50 results obtained from the 62 sentinel chickens that were monitored fortnightly on three sites of the Province of Trento during 2005. The individual volumes of serum from May 4, 2005 through June 28, 2005 were too small for analysis at a 1/10 dilution. Therefore, the data are expressed with the lowest positive titre being 1/20. However, in the older chickens the volumes of sera were slightly larger and could be titrated from 1/10 dilution. Thus, all posi- tive results, i.e., including those from 1/10 di- lution, are presented in Table 1. Of the original 52 chicks that were placed in May on the farms of Tesero and Pietramurata, 47 (90%) individ- uals seroconverted to WNV showing an anti- body titer of at least 1/20, and in many cases, the titers increased during the period of expo- sure. The GMT recorded at these sites was re- spectively 35.25 in Tesero and 31.46 in Pietra- murata. Eleven of 52 chicks that had been kept in- doors until they were 2 weeks old were already seropositive for WNV before being released RIZZOLI ET AL.412 D ow nl oa de d by U c D av is L ib ra ri es U ni ve rs ity o f C al if or ni a D av is f ro m w w w .li eb er tp ub .c om a t 0 3/ 04 /1 9.

However, 2 weeks later, eight of these chicks showed an antibody titer of �1/20, while nine new seroconversions (�1/20) were recorded, implying exposure to WNV. The number of seroconversions increased significantly during May and then continued to increase more gradually until the end of July (Fig. 2). The additional 10 chickens that were placed outdoors at Cavedine on June 14, 2005 sero- converted within 2 weeks from 10% (1/10) on June 21 to 100% (10/10), with titers ranging from 1/20 to 1/160. All of these sera remained positive with gradual increases in titer for the remaining period of observation and with a GMT of 32.62. In order to increase the stringency of the tests and thereby to detect stronger immune re- sponses, the positive PRNT50 samples were re- calculated using a 90% plaque reduction end- point. The Tesero samples recorded 5/26 PRNT90 positive samples with titers of 1/20 on June 29, 2005 and 8/25 positive samples on July 13, 2005 with titers ranging from 1/10 to 1/40. Prior to June 29, 2005, no samples from any of the sites recorded PRNT90 positive samples. These results appear to suggest that Tesero showed greater viral activity than Pietramu- rata. However, the comparison of the GMT us- ing PRNT50 titers did not differ statistically (F(2,271) � 1.28; p � 0.27). The more stringent tests demonstrate that, during the period of major seroconversion (May to late July), im- mune responses in some chickens were equiv- alent to those that would be expected in ani- mals that presented with clinical symptoms. However, it is known that, although chickens respond immunologically to infectious WNV, they do not succumb to disease caused by this virus (Komar 2003). Of the 34 additional sera multi-tested for West Nile virus (WN-DAK), Usutu virus (USUV), and Koutango virus, 16/34 produced positive WN virus results but only 3/34 were positive for USUV, of which two were negative for WNV. These combined observations con- firm the specificity of the test for WNV or a very closely related virus. The third serum had a high titer (1:80) against USUV, a slightly lower titer against WNV, and a low titer against KOUV. This is almost certainly an example of antigenic cross-reactivity because of the higher titer. Two sera showed low antibody titers (1/10) for KOUV, but were negative against WNV and USUV. We conclude that these tests WNV DETECTED IN NORTHERN ITALY IN SENTINEL CHICKENS 413 FIG. 1.

DISCUSSION WNV causes human epidemics and is also known to circulate amongst a wide range of wildlife species in Russia (Lvov et al. 2004) and the Czech Republic (Ernek et al. 1977, Barkonyi et al. 2005, Hubalek and Halouzka 1999). More- over, a variety of strains of the virus have been isolated several times in these countries. Ro- mania suffered a significant human epidemic outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1996 and further outbreaks in 1997 and 1998 (Savage et al. 1999, Cernescu et al. 2000). Nevertheless, de- spite these epidemics in central Europe, and al- though there have been sporadic cases of WNV infection in wildlife species, in general this virus has not caused significant human epi- demic outbreaks in western European coun- tries. Thus, WNV is not considered to present a major epidemic threat to humans in this area of Europe. Occasional cases of neurological dis- ease due to WNV have been recorded in horses in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002) and in the Ca- margue region of France (Durand et al. 2002), and serological evidence of the presence of a WNV-related virus has been obtained in many other parts of Europe (Buckley et al. 2003, Mur- gue et al. 2002). Thus, there is concern that WNV has the potential to cause human epi- demic outbreaks in Europe, but at this time, we have no clear understanding of the underlying ecological and epidemiological basis for WNV epidemicity. The data presented in this brief study are based on the plaque reduction neutralization test which is more discriminating than other serological tests following primary immuno- logical responses (Burke and Monath 2001). The results obtained by testing in parallel the sera of adult chickens, exposed for at least two subsequent years to mosquitos bites or to con- tact with migratory birds, clearly indicate that the neutralization results are highly specific and can discriminate between antibodies due to exposure to different flaviviruses which may circulate in the same geographic area. The PRNT results presented in this study therefore show clearly that WNV, or a very closely related virus, and to a lesser extent USUV, are transmitted to sentinel chickens and presumably to other outdoor animals or hu- mans in Northern Italy, despite the fact that there are no records of recognized neurologi- cal disease due to these viruses in humans, an- imals or birds. It is presumed that WNV is being introduced annually from warmer coun- tries such as Africa by migratory birds that in part overfly and, in part, reproduce in the re- gions where this study was carried out. Ac- cording to the sentinel chicken survey, efficient virus transmission between, or to chickens, ap- pears to commence in late spring and contin- ues during the summer period. Whilst the pres- ence of mosquitoes such as Aedes spp, Anopheles spp. Culex spp, Coquillettidia spp and Culiseta spp. is recognized in this part of Italy (Ferrarese 1994), the high efficiency with which the virus appears to be transmitted to the chicken pop- ulation, suggests that mechanisms additional to arthropod transmission, such as fecal and/or oral transmission (Banet-Noach et al. 2003, Ko- mar et al. 2003), could contribute significantly to transmission efficiency. In addition, non- viremic transmission which was recently demonstrated in controlled laboratory experi- ments with WNV-infected mosquitoes (Higgs WNV DETECTED IN NORTHERN ITALY IN SENTINEL CHICKENS 415 4 - May 18 - May 31 - May 14 - Jun 28 - Jun 12 - Jul 26 - Jul Date 0 10N um be r of s er oc on ve rs io ns 20 30 40 50 FIG. 2.

F or p er so na l u se o nl y. et al. 2005), might also increase the efficiency of WNV transmission. An obvious question arises from these sen- tinel experiments: Why is there no disease in animals and birds in Northern Italy? First, one possibility is that the strains of WNV that cir- culate silently in western Europe are naturally sylvatic in Africa; that is, these viruses might correspond to the lineage II clade of viruses de- fined by Lanciotti et al. (1999). Second, these sylvatic viruses are not considered to be highly virulent for mammalian species, presumably because they have evolved with vertebrate species over a long period of time in Africa. Third, the low virulence could reflect genetic resistance that has evolved in European species as the viruses have been introduced annually from Africa. Fourth, mosquito density and/or vector competence may rarely reach suffi- ciently high levels amongst human populations in northern Italy, and presumably other more northerly parts of western Europe, to effect an epidemic outbreak of WN fever or encephali- tis. It is believed that the epidemics in Roma- nia in 1996 and in Russia during the beginning of the new millenium arose largely because of the climatic conditions that ensured high mos- quito densities and high virus transmission ef- ficiency (Roehrig et al. 2002). In conclusion, this preliminary investigation indicates that WNV or a very closely related virus is introduced into northern Italy, pre- sumably annually, by migratory birds from Africa under a variety of different ecological conditions that characterise the alpine envi- ronment, ie ranging from the lower, warmer and wetter valleys to higher altitudes where the density of potential vector mosquitoes is ex- pected to be lower. The gradually increasing antibody titers and proportions of positive sen- tinel chickens through the summer months im- ply that, once introduced into a region, the virus is then able to circulate efficiently amongst the resident populations. Our obser- vations support and extend the findings of oth- ers that, although mosquitoes are known to be important vectors in disease transmission, other modes of transmission such as fecal, oral, and aerosol may also be important in the trans- mission of WNV (Nir et al. 1965, Komar et al. 2003). Discrimination between these different transmission routes could be addressed in fu- ture studies using sentinel chickens in individ- ually fenced open areas to avoid chick-to-chick infection. Clearly, we now need to understand why in most cases WNV can disperse very successfully without causing overt disease, but on other oc- casions its introduction to a region can lead to major epidemic outbreaks.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length E gene sequences obtained for 30 Brazilian SLEV strains was performed using different methods including Bayesian and relaxed molecular clock approaches. A new genetic lineage was suggested, hereafter named genotype VIII, which co-circulates with the previously described genotype V in the Brazilian Amazon region. Genotypes II and III were restricted to São Paulo state (South-east Atlantic rainforest ecosystem). The analysis also suggested the emergence of an SLEV common ancestor between 1875 and 1973 (mean of 107 years ago), giving rise to two major genetic groups: genotype II, more prevalent in the North America, and a second group comprising the other genotypes (I and III–VIII), broadly dispersed throughout the Americas, suggesting that SLEV initially emerged in South America and spread to North America. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the high genetic variability of SLEV and its geographical dispersion in Brazil and other New World countries. INTRODUCTION Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is an encephalito- genic arbovirus with a primary life cycle associated with Culex mosquitoes and wild birds (Travassos da Rosa et al., 1997; Vasconcelos et al., 1998; Reisen, 2003). Taxonom- ically, Saint Louis encephalitis virus is a recognized species of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) group, which includes other important human pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV), JEV and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (Calisher & Gould, 2003). SLEV is widely distributed throughout the western hemi- sphere from Canada to Argentina. SLEV was first isolated in 1933 during a major epidemic that occurred in St Louis, Missouri, USA, with more than 1000 encephalitis cases reported. Outbreaks or clusters of encephalitis cases associated with SLEV have been reported annually in the USA (Reisen, 2003). Usually, the fatality rate ranges from 5 to 20 % (Tsai & Mitchell, 1988), with higher mortality rates observed among the elderly (.75 years of age) (Reisen, 2003). The low number of human cases reported in tropical regions of the Americas may reflect inadequate laboratory diagnosis, circulation of less virulent virus strains and/or enzootic cycles involving mosquitoes that are not typically anthropophilic (Spense, 1980). Only three SLEV strains have been isolated from humans in Brazil. Two patients resident in Para state had clinical manifestations char- acterized by fever and jaundice (Pinheiro et al., 1981; Vasconcelos et al., 1998), whilst one from São Paulo was suspected of dengue-like disease (Rocco et al., 2005). None of them had neurological symptoms. Recently, the SLEV genome was detected by RT-PCR in four patients with clinical symptoms similar to those observed in dengue fever, as well as in two other patients clinically diagnosed as presenting with viral meningoencephalitis, in the muni- cipality of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, south-eastern Brazil (Mondini et al., 2007a, b). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the SLEV E gene sequences determined in this study are GU808530–GU808559. Details of the SLEV strains included in the phylogenetic analysis are available with the online version of this paper. Journal of General Virology (2010), 91, 2420–2427 DOI 10.1099/vir.0.019117-0 2420 019117 G 2010 SGM Printed in Great Britain Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.2.111 On: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 19:25:20 In Brazil, several SLEV strains have been obtained from wild birds, especially from those belonging to the family Formicariidae (Dégallier et al., 1992), and also from Culex mosquitoes. Furthermore, many strains have been isolated from Culex declarator and Culex coronator mosquitoes, both predominantly ornithophilic but also able to infect primates and considered potential SLEV vectors in the Brazilian Amazon (Travassos da Rosa et al., 1985; Hervé et al., 1986; Vasconcelos et al., 1991). Other potential vectors, including species belonging to the genera Aedes, Mansonia and Sabethes, can become infected and transmit SLEV to other vertebrate hosts. Thus, secondary cycles certainly exist on different forest levels, resulting in the participation of other animals in the cycle, including rodents and marsupials on the ground and non- human primates in the canopy (Hervé et al., 1986). Moreover, a serological survey performed on equines from the Brazilian Amazon and Pantanal areas revealed a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (50.9 %) to SLEV (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Previous phylogenetic studies based on complete nucleo- tide sequences of the envelope gene (E) (Kramer & Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003; May et al., 2008; Auguste et al., 2009; Ottendorfer et al., 2009) and the ORF (10 236 nt) (Baillie et al., 2008) of SLEV strains have revealed the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas. However, there is no consensus in terms of number of SLEV genetic lineages and sublineages. Most SLEV strains have been grouped geographically (Kramer & Chandler, 2001), suggesting that SLEV is pre- dominantly maintained in a particular area. However, some strains have occasionally been transported between areas within and outside the USA (Kramer et al., 1997; Kramer & Chandler, 2001). There is no evidence of a correlation between phylogenetic grouping (based on the nucleotide sequence of the E gene) and phenotypic characteristics (such as virulence) (Kramer et al., 1997). In those analyses, the SLEV strains from the Brazilian Amazon were classified as genotype V (subgenotypes VA and VB), whilst isolates from south-eastern Brazil (São Paulo state) were classified as genotypes II and III. In this study, we examined the molecular epidemiology of SLEV, including the genetic diversity and dispersal of SLEV, through phylogenetic analysis based on the complete nucleotide sequence of the E gene of 30 SLEV strains isolated in the Brazilian Amazon that had not previously been studied. RESULTS The nucleotide sequence divergence between groups was assessed and determined as 6.3±0.4 % (mean±SD). The mean within-group genetic divergence was estimated at 4 % ranging from 3.2 % for genotype II to 4.7 % for genotype IV, and the confidence value (CV) was determined as 5.1 %. Phylogenetic trees constructed by neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum-parsimony (MP), maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods revealed similar topologies. All methods generated trees with a similar topology; thus, we used the ML and Bayesian reconstructions, which presented higher bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability values, respectively, to represent the final topology. The phylogeny depicted all SLEV strains divided into eight phylogenetic groups: groups I–VII corresponding to previously described genotypes (Kramer & Chandler, 2001) and a distinct group, hereafter designated genotype VIII. Phylogenetic groups were determined using the association of bootstrap (.75 %), posterior probability (.0.9) and CV (5.1 %) as the criteria established for group inclusion or exclusion. Fourteen out of 37 strains (37.8 %) isolated in the Brazilian Amazon region were identified as genotype VIII, and 23 (62.2 %) as genotype V (Fig. 1). Seven strains isolated in Pará state were classified as subgenotype VIIIA. One strain isolated in Mato Grosso state was classified as subgenotype VIIIB together with six other isolates from Pará state (Fig. 1). For genotype V, nine isolates (eight from Pará state and one from Rondônia) were grouped in the VA subgenotype, whilst seven isolates from Pará were included in the VB subgenotype. To investigate the divergence time among SLEV strains in the Americas, we used a time-scaled analysis based on evolutionary rates estimated using the Bayesian coalescent method (Fig. 1). The nucleotide substitution rate for all analysed strains ranged from 3.961024 to 7.761024 substitutions per site per year (mean of 4.961024 substitutions per site per year). The time of emergence of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for SLEV in the Americas [(expressed as the 95 % highest posterior density (HPD)] was estimated to have occurred between 1875 and 1973 (mean 1898). For genotype II, a common parental virus emerged between 1898 and 1930 (mean 1920). For the group including genotypes I and III–VIII, a common virus ancestor emerged between 1893 and 1942 (mean 1915). The time of emergence for each genotype was estimated as follows: genotype I, between 1924 and 1951 (mean 1932); genotype V between 1944 and 1952 (mean 1948); genotype VIII, between 1956 and 1966 (mean 1959); genotype VI between 1946 and 1969 (mean 1949); genotype VII between 1962 and 1965 (mean 1964); genotype IV between 1962 and 1968 (mean 1966); and genotype III between 1967 and 1979 (mean 1971) (Fig. 1). DISCUSSION Previous studies on comparative phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas (Kramer & Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003; Baillie et al., 2008; May et al., 2008; Auguste et al., 2009; Ottendorfer et al., 2009), but there is disagreement among authors regarding the classification of certain strains into lineages and sublineages.

Rodrigues and others 2422 Journal of General Virology 91 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.2.111 On: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 19:25:20 Our comparative and chronological phylogenetic analysis carried out using full-length E gene sequences for 133 SLEV strains, 30 of them sequenced in this study, identified the presence of the seven genotypes reported by Kramer & Chandler (2001), as well as 14 strains within a new genotype, designated genotype VIII (Fig. 1). The results obtained by the molecular clock analysis suggested that SLEV is a relatively new flavivirus in comparison with other flaviviruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus (Zanotto et al., 1995, 1996; Bryant et al., 2007), as its evolutionary history was dated between 1875 and 1973 (mean 1898). The analysis conducted by Auguste et al. (2009), which included 73 SLEV strains, indicated SLEV dispersal from South America towards North America and is in agreement with the current chronological analysis of the 133 SLEVs performed in this study (Fig. 1). In fact, the current analysis suggests evolutionary events that occurred almost simultaneously in both hemispheres (North America: 77–108 years ago; South America: 72–121 years ago) through the introduction of a given progenitor (geno- type common ancestor), leading to the emergence and geographical dispersal of distinct phylogenetic lineages in North and South America along the time line. These two ancestral groups are mainly represented by: (i) genotype II, which was almost entirely restricted to North America and included the strains isolated during major SLEV epidemics in North America between 1933 and 2003; and (ii) the other genotypes I and III–VIII, which were more widely distributed and responsible for outbreaks, epizootics and/or enzootic transmission during the same period of time in various countries in South America (Argentina, Brazil and Peru), Central America (Guatemala and Panama) and the Caribbean (Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago), as well as in the USA (Fig. 1). Genotypes V and VIII were more prevalent in Brazil and, according to the analysis using the relaxed molecular clock method, these genotypes evolved from a common ancestor between 1937 and 1950, segregating with time into two distinct subgenotypes that emerged in almost the same period (Fig. 1). High Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPPs) support the designation of SLEV genotype VIII (1.0), as well as the subgenotypes VIIIA (0.97) and VIIIB (0.92). The genotype VIII phylogenetic group was also supported by its within-group genetic divergence (3.9 %), which was less than the CV (5.1 %) used as a criterion for group inclusion or exclusion (Fig. 1). Genotype VIII was restricted to the Pará state in the northern Amazon region, whilst genotype V was widely distributed in the Americas, with strains isolated in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago, which were grouped in subgenotype VA, and USA strains, which were grouped in subgenotype VB. Based on our analysis, the MRCA for subgenotype VA emerged between 1948 and 1955 (mean 1953) and is more closely related to a Trinidad and Tobago strain, following a dispersion pattern in the Brazilian Amazon from east to west in different muni- cipalities of Pará (Altamira, Belém, Faro, Itaituba, Medicilândia, Oriximiná, Santarém and Tucurui) and the Rondônia states (Jamari) (Fig. 2). The prevalence of subgenotype VA in the 1980s was higher than that observed for subgenotype VB, being subsequently detected over the time in Tucuruı́ (1990) and Medicilândia (2002) in Pará state (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the SLEV strains from Cali- fornia (1998–2001) and Texas (2002) identified as geno- type V were closely related to the strain from Medicilândia isolated in 2002 (BRA-02) (Fig. 1), suggesting an intense traffic of SLEV through the two American subcontinents, probably by migratory birds. SLEV strains identified as genotype VB were isolated in the 1960s and 1970s from wild birds and mosquitoes or sentinel animals at a surveillance site for arboviruses placed in a forested area near Belém, the capital of Pará state (Table 1, Fig. 2). The circulation of SLEV in the 1970s was associated with isolation of the BRA-78 strain from a patient resident in Belém, although epidemiological investigations in the workplace and residence of the patient revealed no evidence of extensive SLEV transmission (Pinheiro et al., 1981). The subgenotype VB was also isolated in the north-eastern and southern regions of Pará, respectively, in the municipalities of Ipixuna (1960), Itaituba (1971, 1973) and Marabá (1984) (Table 1, Fig. 2). The phylogenetic analysis suggested a broad distribution of SLEV genotype VIII in the Amazon (Fig. 2). Genotype VIII represented 41.7 % (n55) and 61.5 % (n58) of the Amazonian isolates from the 1970s (n512) and 1980s (n513), respectively. Subgenotype VIIIA was already detected in Brazil in 1964, as demonstrated by strain BRA-64B. Furthermore, strains were also detected in 1984 in different municipalities from distinct geographical Fig. 1.

In the surveillance site neighbouring Belém, the subgeno- types VA, VB, VIIIA and VIIIB were also detected. The VIIIA and VIIIB subgenotypes were identified until 1984 (Figs 1 and 2); however, it was not possible to conclude whether there is current circulation of these subgenotypes in the Brazilian Amazon due to the small numbers of SLEV strains isolated in the years following those included in the analysis. The two SLEV strains isolated in São Paulo state, south- eastern Brazil, were distinct from those from the Brazilian Amazon region, with one strain (BRA-68) identified as a member of genotype II and the other (BRA-04) a member of genotype III (Santos et al., 2006). The BRA-04 strain was isolated from a patient with clinical symptoms suggestive of dengue fever (Rocco et al., 2005) and was genetically related to SLEV strains isolated from Culex quinquefascia- tus mosquitoes during a SLEV outbreak in 2005 in Córdoba, Argentina (Diaz et al., 2006; May et al., 2008). Based on the time-scaled analysis, our results suggested that SLEV genotype II was the first to emerge in the Americas between 1898 and 1930, followed, in order, by genotypes I, VI, VIII, IV, VII, III and V within a period of 42 years between 1936 and 1978. In conclusion, this study identified a new genetic lineage of SLEV (genotype VIII) and demonstrated that genotypes V and VIII are largely distributed in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas genotypes II and III are genetic lineages that circulate in an area restricted to the south-east Atlantic Forest system (state of São Paulo).

Thirty low-passage-number SLEV strains were obtained from the reference arbovirus collection at the Department of Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fevers, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Brazil, isolated between 1964 and 2002 in the states of Pará (n528), Rondônia (n51) and Mato Grosso (n51) (Table 1). The viral strains were obtained primarily from infected newborn mice brains. The lyophilized strains were rehydrated and recovered after a single passage in Vero cells. RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of infected Vero cells exhibiting approximately 75 % cytopathic effect. RNA extractions were performed using the Trizol LS method (Gibco Life Sciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR. The SLEV full-length E gene was amplified by RT-PCR using three sets of primers specific to the E region (F880/B1629, F1390/C207 and F1990/B2586; Kramer & Chandler, 2001). Amplicons were purified using a PureLink Quick Gel Extraction kit (Invitrogen) and the cDNA was sequenced directly using the dideoxyribonucleo- tide chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) in an automated capillary sequencer (ABI 3130; Applied Biosystems) using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems). Amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the same primers as for the RT-PCRs. Assembly and sequence analysis. The obtained sequences were first analysed for quality and then assembled into a single contig using the SeqMan v5.0 program (LaserGene; DNAStar). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTAL_X software to determine the genetic divergence among the studied strains. The genetic divergence within and between groups was assessed using MEGA v4.0 software (Kumar et al., 2008) and used to estimate a CV to define the phylogenetic grouping. The CV was determined as described previously (Medeiros et al., 2007) as the mean of genetic divergence within and between groups based on well-established SLEV genotypes (genotypes I–VII). Viruses were grouped when the genetic divergence within a given group was less than the CV; strains were excluded from a given group if the value for the genetic divergence within the group was greater than or equal to the CV.

St Louis encephalitis virus: divergence and dispersal http://vir.sgmjournals.org 2425 Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 168.150.2.111 On: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 19:25:20 Phylogenetic analysis and evolution. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the entire E gene sequences obtained for the 30 Brazilian SLEV strains with sequences of homologous regions from 103 other SLEV strains (see Supplementary Table S1, available in JGV Online) available in GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the NJ (Saitou & Nei, 1987), ML and MP methods using PAUP v4.0 software (Swofford, 1999). The Modeltest v3.6 program (Posada & Crandall, 1998) was used to determine the best nucleotide substitution model to be used according to the Akaike information criteria. For the NJ method, a distance matrix was calculated using the aligned sequences using the Tamura three-parameter and gamma distribution (gamma distri- bution parameter51). For the MP method, a 4 : 1 transition : trans- version ratio was used. Bootstrap replication (2000 replicates) was applied to give confidence on phylogenetic grouping (Felsenstein, 1985). WNV strain NY99 (GenBank accession no. DQ211652) was used as an outgroup to root the trees. Phylogenetic groups were defined using the highest bootstrap or BPP values over each main node in combination with the criteria for group inclusion or exclusion using the CV as reference. The nucleotide substitution model selected by Modeltest was also used to estimate trees using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches implemented in MrBayes and BEAST (Drummond et al., 2003). In this case, the final tree presented was the maximum clade credibility tree estimated in BEAST with a chain length of 175 million, sampling every 1000. The BPP was estimated from the data obtained for 50 % of the generated consensus trees (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001). The TRACER program (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) was used to inspect whether MrBayes reached the appropriated conver- gence. Nucleotide substitution rates and the age of the MRCA were estimated for the whole dataset using models that allowed for rate variation among lineages under a relaxed (uncorrelated exponential) molecular clock (Drummond et al., 2006) performed in BEAST where tip times corresponded to the year of virus sampling (Drummond et al., 2003). Bootstrap values less than 75 % and a BPP less than 0.9 were not represented in the final tree. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Brendan Flannery for his critical review of the manuscript.

VANELLA Instituto de Virolog@a, CÃ³rdoba,Argentina, and the BelÃ©mVirus Laboratory, BelÃ©m,Brazil* slaughterhouse. Also included in the study were a small number of human sera collected in 1961 and 1962 at three sitesâ€”La Gallareta, ParanÃ¡ and Corrientesâ€”on the ParanÃ¡River in the Litoral region of northeastern Argentina. MATERIALS AND METHODS The human donors, all apparently healthy, were of both sexes and ranged in age from 4 to 69 years. Wild mammals were generally caught alive in traps and wild birds in mist nets, but occasionally mammals and birds were caught by hand or shot. Bats, rodents, marsupials and wild birds were bled from the heart, domestic birds from the wing vein, cattle, horses and goats from the jugular vein, and rabbits from the marginal ear vein. At the slaughterhouse, animals were bled after death. Bird bloods were collected in heparinized syringes. After separation, all speci mens were stored at â€”15Â°Cuntil tested. Table 2 lists the 24 arboviruses used in this study, their strain numbers and passage levels in newborn mice. All strains were isolated in Brazil: the WEE strain in Rio de Janeiro,2 Itaporanga in SÃ£oPaulo State3 and the rest in the Amazon region by the BelÃ©mVirus Laboratory. BE Ar 7272 virus has been shown by Whitman4 to differ slightly from prototype Cache Valley virus in antigenic properties, but for convenience it will be referred to in this paper as â€œCacheValley.â€• Hernagglutinating antigens were prepared basically by the methods of Clarke and Ca.sals,5 and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were done in plastic plates by a microtechnique de scribed by one of the authors.6 Sera were cx tracted twice with acetone prior to testing. Antigen titers were corrected to 4 units, and serum HI levels of 1:20 or greater on this basis were considered positive. Titers of HI positive sera were determined using 2-fold dilutions. In neutralization (N) tests, infected newborn mouse brain was used as virus source for Bus suquara, Cache Valley and Turlock viruses, and viremic sera of newborn mice for group A and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses. Sera were Epizootics of equine encephalomyelitis, recur ring at intervals of several years, have been described in Argentina since 1919. Some of these are known to have included CÃ³rdoba Province in central Argentina, and during the most recent epizootic, in 1958, the viruses of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)' and western equine enceph alitis (WEE) were isolated in this provrnce from horses. Since the vectors and reservoirs of these viruses in CÃ³rdobaare unknown, and the possible presence of other arboviruses has never been ex plored, a serosurvey by hemagglutination-inhibi tion and neutralization tests was undertaken among human residents and domestic and wild mammals @ndbirds. CÃ³rdoba Province is located in the southern temperate zone, between 29@and 35Â°south lati tude and 62Â°and 66Â°west longitude. The annual median temperature ranges from 17Â°Cin the southeastern portion to 20Â°Cin the northwest. The rainfall pattern is one of wet summers and dry winters; the annual median precipitation is lowest, 200 mm, in the hill area of the northwest and rises to 800 mm in the fertile plains of the southeast. Between June 1962 and June 1963, various localities representative of different ecological zones in the province were sampled (Fig. 1). Table 1 lists the numbers of serum specimens collected by type and locality. Human serum specimens were collected from the rural popula tions at Chancam, Pins, Pocho and Medanito in the northwest; Calera in the foothills along the Rio Primero ; Oncativo and Marcos Ju@rez. Blood specimens from non-human vertebrates (mammals and birds) were collected at Calera; Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming; and Manfredi, the center of an agricul tural grazing zone. In addition, wild birds were captured on a hill near Piquillmn and cattle from various parts of the province were bled at a S The BelÃ©m Virus Laboratory is maintained jointly by the FundaÃ§aoServiÃ§oE8pecial de Sat@de Ptiblica and The Rockefeller Foundation. This study was supported in part by The Rockefeller Foundation. 1073 1074 SABArrINI, SHOPE AND VANELLA test. This single positive was from a 7-year-old boy at Medanito. Three HI negative sera from other Medanith residents (aged 5, 8 and 31 years) failed to protect against 100 LD5, of EEE virus. While there was a greater incidence of group A HI antibody among the sera from mammals and birds, the number of positives was still small. Excluding the results at Manfredi where horses had a history of vaccination with EEE and WEE vaccines, only 34 sera reacted with one or more antigens. These sera came from horses, chickens, cattle and wild birds. In the case of EEE virus, three of 41 sera from unvaccinated horses at Colonia Tirolesa reacted in HI test, two at a titer of 1:20 and one at 1:80. All three sera neutralized at least 10,000 LD@ of virus, while three HI negative horse sera failed to protect against 100 LD@. Only one cattle serum was positive for EEE in both HI test (1 :40) and N test (320 LD@). Three HI negative cattle sera neutralized 800, 200 and 100 LD@.; however, since nonspecific neutralization of EEE virus by cattle sera has been reported,7 these results are not considered conclusive. Table 3 gives the details for the six sera that were positive in HI and/or N test for WEE or AiiM, viruses closely related.8 Horse serum No. 3 is considered positive for WEE with an liii munological cross-reaction with Aura, but the reactions may be due to a double infection. Serum No. 4, from a Furnar-lus rufus, perhaps represents infection with AiiM, although the low dosage used in the N test leaves this a question. The five HI negative sera (two horse, three chicken) included in these N tests failed to neutralize the dosages used. Two of 63 sera from chickens at Colonia Tiro lesa reacted with Mayaro antigen at a titer of 1:20, and one of these neutralized at least 160 LD@of virus. The second HI positive serum was negative in N test, as was the only HI negative serum tested. The other sera HI positive for group A viruses reacted in dilutions of 1:20 or 1:40 and were uniformly negative in N test. Eighteen of these sera reacted with only one antigen: EEE, one Columbina, one Zenaidura and one chicken ; Una, three ZOnOtriCJ&ia,two Zenaidura, one M@thrus bo.dius, one Columbina, one Spinus mageilanieus and one Glaucidium brasilianum; and Pixuna, one Columbina, two cattle and three chickens.

Finally, one M. badius, one M. bonariensis and one Pitangus reacted with three antigensâ€”EEE, IJna and Pixuna. In the N test with Una virus, an HI negative serum from a Speotyto cunicularia, the only bird of this species tested, protected five out of six mice inoculated with 320 LD@oof virus. Although Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus has been isolated in Argentina (as cited by Bettinotti and Aguirre'), no serum reacted with Mucambo virus, which is closely related to VEE.@ Group B viruses. Table 4 shows the numbers of sera that reacted with SLE antigen in HI test. Titers of 1 : 160 or higher were seen. All of the human sera that were HI positive for group B were positive for SLE; some of them also reacted with IlhÃ©usor Busauquara antigen or both, but none reacted with yellow fever antigen. The SLE positive sera from mammals and birds also showed broad group B reactivity. In all cases, however, titers for SLE were equal to or greater than those for other group B antigens. Fifty-four of these SLE positives were exam ined in N test with SLE virus only, and 38 neu trali.sed 50 or more LD.o. Of 20 sera HI negative for group B, four neutralized 50 LD@oof SLE virus. Sera positive for SLE in both tests came from human donors in all localities surveyed except Calera and from horses, goats, cattle, chickens, turkeys, ducks and wild birds (Mob thr'us badius, Chboroceryle, Furnarius, Zenaidura and Columbina). Eight sera from chickens and wild birds (M. badius, Columbmnaand Zonotrichia) reacted only with Bussuquara antigen in HI test and were negative in N test against 100 LD@oof virus. Of five HI negative sera tested with Buseuquara in N test, one chicken serum from Colonia Tirolesa was protective. Bunyamwera group viruses. Forty-one of 87 sera from horses reacted in HI test with Cache Valley antigen, 17 at dilutions of 1 :80 or higher. Three of the positive horse sera which had titers of 1:640, 1:160 and 1:80 with Cache Valley also reacted with Guaroa antigen at titers of 1:20 and 1:40. Twelve other seraâ€”sixhuman, two mule, one goat and three cattleâ€”inhibited Cache Valley antigen at dilutions no higher than 1 :80. Table 5 shows locality and titer for the six positive human sera. No serum reacted only with Guaroa antigen.

Twelve sera reacted with Cara pani, Guam@, Icoaraci, BE H 22511 (Candiri@) or Tacaiuma antigen (Table 7). N testing was not done with these viruses. No serum reacted with Oriboca, Murutucu, Cati@,BE An 46852 (Anhanga) or Itaporanga antigen. DISCUSSION Unexpectedly, little reactivity with EEE and WEE viruses was encountered in this survey. Both HI and neutralizing substance for EEE virus was demonstrated in only five sera (one human, three horse, one cattle) and for WEE in only three sera, all from horses. The other HI positive reactions with these viruses occurred at low titers and are considered nonspecific, a! though they may represent response to a group A agent not included in the study. The greatest numbers of sera reacted with SLE and Cache Valley viruses. These two viruses accounted for all the positive reactions in human sera from the Litoral region. Sera positive for SLE in both HI and N tests came from human donors in all localities except Calera and from horses, cattle, goats, and wild and domestic birds. Added to the serological evidence of SLE activity among residents of Tucum@n, Mendoza and Buenos Aires obtained by Mettler et ob.,â€•' these results indicate a wide dispersal of SLE neutralizing substance in Argentina. Assuming specificity of the neutralization and a short life span of some of the animals involved, these results may also indicate recent virus activity. The excellent correlation of HI and N test positive reactions with Cache Valley virus sug gest.s that this agent or one closely related has been active in CÃ³rdoba Province, involving horses and to a lesser degree man and goats. Of the different ecological zones sampled, Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming, had the highest rate of positivity as well S Viruses with names in parentheses are not yet formally described.

Horses and chickens sampled here accounted for six of the N test positives for EEE and WEE viruses, the only reactors with Turlock virus, and the sole N test positive for Mayaro virus. All horses studied at this location were at least 5 years old and thus could have been infected during the 195S equine encephalomyelitis epizootic or earlier. The fact that no birds were N test l)ositive for EEE and WEE suggests that these viruses may not have 1078 MH4!171N1, 5UO@ hND VAN@I@A been active recently, but lacking sera from younger horse. this point cannot be confirmed, Several domestic and wild birds had HI or neutrallalng substance for Aura, IJna and Pixuna viruses, These results may indicate the presence of one or more additional group A agents In CtSrdobaProvince; on the other hand, since sera were not inactivated, the results may represent the effect of nonspecific, heat-labile neutralizing substance. SUMMARY Serum specimens from human beings (159) and domestic and wild mammals and birds (884) were collected in CÃ´rdoba Province, Argentina, during 1962-1963 and tested in hemagglutina tion-inhibition (HI) and neutralization (N) tests with 24 arboviruses representing groups A, B, C, GuamÃ¡, Bunyamwera, Turlock and Phieboto mus fever plus one ungrouped agent. Included in the study were 54 human sera collected in the Litoral region of northeastern Argentina in 1961 and 1962. There was a high incidence of HI and N test reactors with BE Ar 7272, a Cache Valley-like agent, among human beings, horses and goats, and with St. Louis encephalitis virus among human beings, wild and domestic birds, horses, cattle and goats. A few sera neutralized eastern or western encephalitis, Turlock, Aura, Mayaro or Una virus. Of the different localities sampled, Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck farming, had the highest rate of positivity and the greatest variety of antibody.

Scherret-2001-The relationships between West N.pdf	697Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 Emerging Infectious Diseases West Nile Virus Kunjin (KUN) and West Nile (WN) viruses belong to the Japanese encephalitis (JE) antigenic complex of the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (1). The Flavivirus genus comprises >70 antigenically related, positive-stranded RNA viruses (2,3). KUN and WN viruses are maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving mosquito vectors and bird reservoir hosts, with humans and horses believed to be incidental hosts (4,5). Clinical symptoms most commonly associated with infection with KUN and WN viruses include febrile illness or mild encephalitis. WN virus has been associated with fatal cases of acute meningoenceph- alitis and fulminant hepatitis (6). Early cross-neutralization studies with polyclonal antisera raised to single strains of WN and KUN viruses revealed that these viruses shared a close relationship but were antigenically distinct (7-9). This close relationship was also shown genetically by Coia et al. (10), who compared the sequence of the MRM61C KUN isolate with that of a Ugandan strain of WN (WNFCG) (11-13) and showed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity between the two viruses was 82% and 93%, respectively, in the coding region of the genome. Although genetic studies have shown that KUN virus exists in Australia as a single topotype with <2% nucleotide divergence (14,15), Berthet et al. (16) demonstrat- ed that WN viruses were divided into two lineages. Although these comparisons demonstrated a close relationship between the two viruses, further sequence information is needed from additional isolates of both viruses to fully establish their phylogenetic association within the genus. This report describes the results of sequence analyses of 31 Australian KUN isolates; a KUN isolate from Sarawak, Malaysia; and 28 WN isolates from Africa, India, Europe, and New York (Tables 1 and 2). These virus isolates had all been identified as WN or KUN virus by traditional antigenic means. The Koutango (KOU) isolate was also included in this study, as it belongs to the JE serogroup and is closely related to the KUN/ WN group of viruses (9,17). Materials and Methods Virus and Cell Culture Virus strains sequenced in this study are listed with their sources of isolation in Table 1. African green monkey (Vero) cells were grown at 37°C in M199 (Gibco, New York) with 20 mM HEPES (Gibco) and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for growth or 2% FBS for maintenance. Viruses were cultured in Vero cells by inoculating cell monolayers with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Infected cell culture supernatants were harvested when >70% of the cells exhibited cytopathic effect. Infected supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 x g at 4°C for 15 min, and aliquots were stored at -70°C. A line of Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells was cultured in M199 without HEPES and supplemented with FBS for growth or maintenance, as described. The cells were incubated at 28°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Sequencing A single-step RT-PCR procedure (22) was performed on each virus isolate.

However, genetic and antigenic studies on isolates of these two viruses indicate that the relationship between them is more complex. To better define this relationship, we performed sequence analyses on 32 isolates of KUN virus and 28 isolates of WN virus from different geographic areas, including a WN isolate from the recent outbreak in New York. Sequence comparisons showed that the KUN virus isolates from Australia were tightly grouped but that the WN virus isolates exhibited substantial divergence and could be differentiated into four distinct groups. KUN virus isolates from Australia were antigenically homologous and distinct from the WN isolates and a Malaysian KUN virus. Our results suggest that KUN and WN viruses comprise a group of closely related viruses that can be differentiated into subgroups on the basis of genetic and antigenic analyses. 698Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 West Nile Virus Table 1.

Primer KUN5276 was used with primer KUN4778 (ATA ATG ACA AGC GGG CTG ACC C) for the remaining isolates. The region of the virus genome encompassing the terminus of the nonstructural protein, NS5 and the 5' end of the 3' untranslated region (3’UTR), was amplified by using the previously published universal flavivirus PCR primers EMF1 and VD8 (23). Both strands of the PCR product were then sequenced on a 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Internation- al [ABI], Foster City, CA, USA) by using the same primer pair. The two sequences derived from each PCR product were initially aligned by using the program SeqEd (ABI) and a consensus sequence determined. The consensus sequences were then aligned by using the program Clustal W (24), and results were further analyzed by using phylogenetic programs in Bionavigator (http://www.bionavigator.com). Percentage nucleotide similarity was calculated by the Old Distance (GCG) program, and bootstrap confidence levels were calculated with 1,000 replicates by using the Consense program (25). Sequences determined in this study have been deposited in GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) (Table 1). Additional sequences included in this analysis are listed in Table 2. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Antigenic profiles of each isolate were compared by using a panel of anti-KUN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (26,27) and anti-WN MAbs (28,29) in ELISA as described (26). All MAbs were produced to the E protein except for 3.1112G, which was specific for the NS1 protein. Results Genetic Analysis In accordance with previous reports (16,18,21), the phylogenetic trees generated from both E gene and NS5/ 3'UTR sequences grouped most of the isolates into two major lineages (Figures 1 and 2). Australian KUN isolates and WN isolates from North, West, and central Africa; southern and eastern Europe; India; the Middle East; and New York constituted lineage I. Lineage II comprised WN isolates from West, central, and East Africa and Madagascar. Genetic lineage was not significantly associated with date or source of isolation, with most isolates of both lineages coming from human, mosquito, and avian sources between 1950 and 1990. However, as noted, all viruses isolated during outbreaks of human or avian disease in the last decade belonged to lineage I. Lineage I viruses grouped together with an average sequence identity of 80% (E gene) and 77% (NS5/3'UTR), while the viruses of lineage II contained a single cluster with an average identity of 82% and 83%, respectively. The lineage I viruses were further separated into three clusters: the Australian KUN isolates; the Indian WN viruses; and WN isolates from Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The divergence observed between lineage I and lineage II viruses was in the range of 16.5% to 30.8% and 19% to 36.5% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. High bootstrap confidence levels (100%) for the sequences of the NS5/3'UTR also support the separation of the Table 2.

The clustering of the Indian WN group in lineage I based on sequences in the E gene, however, was at a lower bootstrap confidence level (63%). The sequence of the virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502- 66, grouped outside the two lineages described. Similarly, the KOU virus, which was 72%-73% identical to KUN MP502-66, did not group with either lineage. The range of percentage divergence between KUN MP502-66 and KOU viruses with the lineage I and lineage II viruses (Table 3) shows that these two isolates display similar divergence from all other isolates in this study, supporting their grouping outside the two main lineages. The viruses of lineage I group together in three tight clusters. The first of these includes the Australian KUN viruses, which were 94% identical when sequences of the E gene were compared and 90% when the sequences of the NS5/ 3'UTR were compared. High bootstrap confidence levels (100% for sequences from the E gene and 99% for sequences from the NS5/3’UTR) separated the Australian KUN viruses from the other isolates. However, extremely low bootstrap confidence levels were observed for most of the branches between the Australian KUN viruses in both dendrograms, which also suggests that these viruses are closely related and cannot be definitively separated from each other. The Indian viruses also cluster together, with a sequence identity of 97% and 98% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. The WN isolates in the remaining cluster of lineage I are 90% and 97% identical, respectively, for the regions sequenced. When compared with the Australian KUN isolates, this cluster, which includes the 1999 New York isolate, shared a sequence identity of 89% for the E gene and Figure 1.

Similarly, when the sequences of the Australian KUN isolates were compared with those of the WN Indian viruses, they were 80% identical for the E gene and 77% identical for the NS5/3'UTR. In comparison, the two clusters of WN viruses in lineage I and the WN isolates in lineage II shared an average sequence identity of only 78% and 71% for the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. These results demonstrate that the sequences of some WN isolates are more closely related to the Australian KUN viruses than to other WN isolates. The high degree of nucleotide sequence homology within clusters is consistent with the observed similarity of the amino acid sequences. The most notable variation in amino acid sequence in this study appears around the potential glycosylation site at amino acid 154 of the E protein (Figure 3). The Australian KUN viruses generally contain either the glycosylation motif NYS at this position or the sequence NYF, which abolishes glycosylation of the E protein. In contrast, the KUN virus SH183 has a 154N→ K substitution, which also ablates the potential for glycosylation at this site. In comparison with the KUN prototype, the amino acids 159 (T→ I, T→ V, or T→ Q) and 162 (A→ T) of all the WN isolates in this study contain an amino acid substitution. The KUN isolate P1553 also differs from the KUN prototype at amino acid 159 (T→ I). Two aberrant isolates, 63134Ent280 and WNFCG, incur a deletion of four amino acids (154 through 157), which also abolishes the glycosylation site. Our results concur with those of Berthet et al. (16), who suggested the presence of signature motifs within the E gene that support the segregation of WN viruses into two lineages. These signature residues include the amino acid substitu- tions from lineage I→ II as follows: 172A→ S, 205T→ S, and 210T→ S. The amino acid substitution 208T→ A holds true in general; however, two of the Indian isolates (lineage I) have K at this position and WNFCG (lineage II) has E. Of particular note is the substitution at amino acid 199. The Australian KUN isolates (199S) share the same amino acid as the lineage II WN viruses, while the lineage I viruses contain an N residue at this position. We have also identified an additional three signature motifs (I→ II) at amino acids 128R→ W, 129T→ I, and 131L→ Q. When we attempted to place the Malaysian KUN isolate within either lineage by using these signature motifs, the residues at 128, 129, 131, 172, and 208 were similar to those of lineage I viruses, but the residues at Figure 3. Amino acid alignment of the region surrounding the potential glycosylation site of the E protein (shown in bold). KUN viruses not shown display the identical amino acid sequence as the prototype or the isolate OR205, depending on the glycosylation status of the virus. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. 702Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 West Nile Virus Figure 4. Amino acid alignment of the distal region of the NS5 protein. The KUN viruses not shown display a similar amino acid sequence to the prototype, except for a few minor point mutations not found within the signature motifs. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. 205 and 210 were consistent with those of lineage II viruses. Residue 199 (D) was unlike any of the other viruses. The KOU isolate displayed more similarities with the lineage II WN viruses (residues 131, 172, 199, and 210) when signature motifs were compared. Residues 129 and 208 differed from viruses of both lineages. We have identified signature motifs within the NS5 protein that correlate with the separation of the two lineages. Substitutions between lineages I→ II include 860A→ T, 869Q→ H, 878I→ V (except for the isolate MgAn798, which has 878I→ L), and 899L→ V (except for the isolate ArNa1047, which has 899L→ I) (Figure 4). At amino acid 877, the lineage I WN viruses are separated again from the lineage II WN viruses with an A→ S substitution; however, the KUN isolates (including MP502-66 from Malaysia) have the same motif as the lineage II WN viruses (877S). The amino acid substitution at 903 separates the Indian WN viruses (903S) from the WN and KUN viruses of both lineages (903T), instead grouping them with the Malaysian isolate and the KOU virus. Once again, the signature motifs cannot be used to classify the Malaysian isolate and KOU virus into either lineage. Nucleotide sequences in the 3'UTR of the viruses included in this study had a highly variable region in both length and nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the open reading frame stop codon (Figure 5). Deletions as well as point mutations were observed in this region, which varied from 38 (MgAn798) to 129 (ArNa1047) nt in length. The Australian KUN viruses displayed only point mutations when compared with the KUN prototype, except for the isolate P1553, which contained a 7-nt insertion, consistent with the WN viruses of lineage I. The long deletion in the nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of the WN prototype virus, WNFCG (53 nt), has been described (31); it is also present in the sequences of another two lineage II WN viruses analyzed in this study, Sarafend (53 nt) and MgAn798 (65 nt). The rest of the 3'UTR for these viruses was found to be highly conserved. Antigenic Analysis The MAb 10A1, produced to the KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted specifically with the Australian KUN isolates in ELISA and did not react with the KUN isolate from Malaysia (MP502-66) nor with KOU virus or any of the lineage I or lineage II WN viruses (Table 4). The MAb 546 (29), produced to the WN strain Eg101, reacted with all the lineage I and lineage II WN isolates except WN-Sarafend; it did not react with the KOU, KUN, or Malaysian viruses. The MAbs 2B2, produced to the KUN isolate MRM 16 (27), and 2B4, produced to the WN isolate H442 (28), reacted with all the isolates in the study, while the MAbs 3.67G and 3.91D, again produced to the KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all the isolates except WN-Sarafend. The MAb 3.1112G, produced to the NS1 protein of KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all isolates except KOU. The Mab binding patterns (Table 4) clearly digress and fail to differentiate KUN and WN isolates into two distinct groups. Instead, they define five distinct antigenic groups: Australian KUN viruses, Malaysian KUN virus, lineage I and lineage II WN viruses, WN-Sarafend, and KOU virus. Conclusion The results of the phylogenic analysis in this report clearly illustrate that the KUN, WN, and KOU viruses make up a closely related group of viruses, which can be further subdivided into several subgroups on the basis of genetic and antigenic data. Previous phylogenic studies have also shown that KUN and WN viruses share a close relationship (16- 18,21). This report however, further defines this relationship by using a comprehensive panel of both viruses. Also included in this study were several anomalous isolates, including an isolate from Southeast Asia (MP502-66), a laboratory-adapted WN strain of uncertain passage history and origin (Sarafend), and a flavivirus from West Africa (KOU), which has been shown to be closely related to the KUN/WN group of viruses. The region sequenced in the E gene spans a glycosylation site that, although highly conserved among viruses of the JE antigenic subgroup, is absent from many KUN and WN isolates (16,26; Scherret JH, Khromykh AA, Mackenzie JS, Hall RA, unpub. data). While glycosylation at this site has been associated with neuroinvasiveness of WN isolates in mice (32,33), the biological significance of E protein glycosylation is still unclear. Indeed, sequence analysis of the E gene of WN viruses responsible for fatal outbreaks of encephalitis in Romania (Rom 96) and New York (NY99) showed that only the latter contained a potential glycosylation site, casting doubt on the importance of E protein glycosylation in viral pathogenesis. However, our studies and those of others have shown that limited passage of WN and KUN viruses in some cell types can alter the glycosylation status of the E protein and that analysis of passaged viral isolates should be interpreted with caution 703Vol. 7, No. 4, July–August 2001 Emerging Infectious Diseases West Nile Virus Figure 5. Nucleotide sequence alignment of the 3'UTR (untranslated region) proximal to the open reading frame stop codon (shown in bold) showing distinctive insertions or deletions. Alignment was performed with the Clustal W program. (33; Scherret JH, Khromykh AA, Mackenzie JS, Hall RA, unpub. data). The 3'UTR of flaviviruses ranges in length from 400 nt to 600 nt and is thought to play a crucial role in the initiation and regula- tion of viral translation, replica- tion, and assembly. It includes a potential stable secondary RNA structure at its terminus (2,34-38), and upstream it contains several domains that appear to be con- served among mosquito-borne fla- viviruses (2,39, 40). Men et al. (41) have suggested that deletions in the distal 80 nt to 90 nt would most likely lead to disruption of the stem-loop and loss of viability. In contrast, the region sequenced in this study contains highly variable regions suitable for genetic classi- fication and analysis of the relationships among viruses, which had been subjected to deletions or insertions or both during evolution (17). Phylogenetic trees con- structed from sequence data from both regions identified two major lineages, consistent with previous reports (16,18,21). These two lineages did not separate the KUN isolates from the WN isolates; rather, they emphasized the close link between KUN and WN viruses of lineage I. Nevertheless, within lineage I, the Australian KUN isolates formed a tight cluster with an average nucleotide divergence of 6% for the E gene and 10% for the NS5/3'UTR. In con- trast, the WN isolates were spread between the two lineages in three clusters, with a divergence of up to 30.6% for sequences of the E gene and 28.3% for sequences of the NS5/3'UTR. Signature motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences of the E and NS5 proteins also support the separation of the viruses into two lineages. The virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502-66, and the African virus, KOU, pose a conundrum as to their relationship with the WN and KUN group of viruses. Statistical support for clustering with either of the WN lineages was poor, suggesting that they represent two single-isolate lineages. Although our previous findings suggested that the Malaysian KUN isolate may represent an evolutionary link between the KUN and WN viruses (17), the lack of sequence identity between KUN MP502-66 and the KUN/WN group of viruses in our study suggests that these viruses have evolved separately from a common ancestor.

The WN-specific MAb used in this study, 546, could not distinguish subgroups within the WN group of viruses; however, Besselaar and Blackburn (28) and Damle et al. (42) have differentiated Indian WN isolates from lineage I South African strains by using MAbs, consistent with the earlier studies of Hammam et al. (43,44). These findings support our sequence data, which show tight clustering of the Indian isolates on a separate branch from other WN isolates in the phylogenetic trees (Figures 1 and 2). Additional MAbs to the E protein of WN viruses may be required to differentiate between lineage I and lineage II viruses. The unique binding pattern of anti-E MAbs to the Sarafend WN isolate is difficult to explain in light of the E gene sequencing results and amino acid alignments, which show that this virus is similar to other lineage II viruses. However, Sarafend also differs from other WN viruses in the way that it buds from the cell membrane of infected cells (45). Sequencing of the entire prM and E genes of this virus may identify the basis for structural differences in the envelope heterodimer that account for the loss of MAb binding sites and unusual virion maturation. Phylogenetic analyses enable more precise determina- tion of the relationships among similar viruses and consequently aid in identifying the origin of unknown viruses in subsequent outbreaks. The importance of defining the relationship between the KUN and WN viruses was emphasized during the 1999 outbreak of viral encephalitis in New York City (46,47). Until recently, WN and KUN had been classified as distinct virus types in the Flavivirus genus. However, the latest report by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (25) recognized that KUN and WN should not be classified as two separate species and designated KUN as a subtype of WN. Our results suggest that this definition requires further consideration. The species should perhaps be further subdivided into at least six subtypes on the basis of the clusters of viruses displayed in the phylogenetic trees. Subtypes would then include lineage II WN group, Indian WN group, Australian KUN group, lineage I WN group, Malaysian group, and KOU group. Indeed, the assessment of viruses from each subgroup for transmissibility by the major mosquito vectors of each geographic region and relative virulence and amplification in primate, equine, and avian species will provide valuable information on the likelihood and possible consequences of the spread of these viruses to new geographic regions. Additional studies of cross-protection between subgroups by natural infection or immunization with vaccines derived from these viruses and the specificity and sensitivity of serologic and molecular assays for each subgroup in monitoring and diagnostic applications will be useful in defining control strategies.

SEYMOUR,t P. H. PERALTA, ANDG. G. MONTGOMERY Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, Panama 5, Republic ofPanamd, and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, P.O. Box 2072, Balboa, Republic of Panama Abstract. Plasmas of sloths and other Central Panamanian wild vertebrates were tested for plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibodies against four flaviviruses and one alpha virus. Forty percent of 97 two-toed sloths, Choloepus hoffmanni, and 8% of 168 three-toed sloths, Brady/ms variegatus, were specifically positive against St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. The prevalence of antibody against SLE virus was considerably higher in sloths than in any other group of wild vertebrates tested, including birds, and was found mainly in adult sloths. Specific PRN antibody against yellow fever (YF) virus was found only in monkeys. A high prevalence of PRN antibody against Ihhcus and Mayaro viruses was detected in agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, and against Mayaro virus in howler monkeys, Alouatta villosa. No plasma was specifically positive against Bussuquara virus. The results are interpreted as evidence that sloths are probably not important hosts in jungle YF cycles, but may be sig nificant amplifying hosts in tropical SLE virus cycles. Tree sloths are New World arboreal mammals related to armadillos and anteaters. They occur from Honduras to Argentina. The two existing genera include Bradypus, the three-toed sloths, and Choloepus, the two-toed sloths. Although they share the same arboreal habitat and many con vergent anatomical features, the behavioral and anatomical differences between the two genera are clear enough to place them in separate families. â€˜@2 Sloths arc difficult or impossible to see when cam ouflaged in their forest canopy habitat, but they are nevertheless among the most abundant mam mals of the Neotropical forest.@5 Both genera arc characterized by bow body temperature and met abobic rate,6 and are highly evolved for a vege tanian@ Choloepus commonly survive in captivity for over 10 years,7 8 and probably both genera are bonghived in nature.

Interest in sloths as hosts of flaviviruses initially centered on the search for alternate hosts in New World jungle yellow fever (YF) cycles, which are usually considered to involve monkeys and forest canopy mosquitoes.9 10In early experimental work, Colombian two-toed sloths Choloepus didactylus showed little potential as YF amplifying hosts.9 In 1974, P. A. Webb and K. M. Johnson of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory repeated this obser vation with the Panamanian species Choloepus hoffmanni ; however, they also showed that some Panamanian Bradypus variegatus sustained re markabby bong experimental YF viremias of un usually high titer, with no apparent ill effects.â€• The hypothesis that sloths are natural amphi fying hosts of YF virus was tested by field studies in Panama in 1974â€”76,during and after a wave of jungle YF. These and other concurrent field studies also included observations on related fla viviruses, among them St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, a human pathogen which is transmitted by mosquitoes among wild birds in most of North 12 In the tropics, SLE virus causes spo radic human illness, but its natural cycle is poorly 13 As with YF virus, inoculation of sloths with SLE virus produces prolonged vire mias of high@ Field studies of flavivirus in fections of sloths were therefore a test of the role of these animals in tropical cycles of SLE virus as well as YF virus.

Other anticles in this series describe experimental SLE infection of sloths and conmonants,'4 as well as the isolation from sloths of several viruses un related to flaviviruses.15 MATERIALS AND METHODS Study areas Sloths were captured at five Central Panama nian localities (Fig. 1). At Aguacate (elevation 300 meters) and Chilibre (100 meters), vegetation was mostly secondary, with patches of primary tropical humid forest (Holdnidge ifi'6 At the other three areas the vegetation was pre dominantly primary, with the following Holdridge classifications: El Llano-CantI road camp (eleva tion 300 meters), tropical wet forest; Cerno Azul (500â€”800 meters), tropical humid forest; MajÃ© (less than 200 meters) tropical humid-to-dry tran sitional forest. Animal capture and bleeding Two-toed sloths C. hoffmanni (Fig. 2), and three toed sloths B. variegatus (Fig. 3), were captured by hand; at Cerro Azul, they were fitted with ra dio transmitters'7 and periodically recaptured for serial blood samples. Sloth age was determined as infant when the animal was still attached to its mother, juvenile when it was independent but not fully grown, and adult when it had reached full size, (Brady/ms forearm 180 mm; Choloepus fore arm 170 mm). B. variegatus leave their mothers FIGURE 2. Choloepus hoffmanni, the two-toed sloth.

At El Llano-CantI and Cenro Azul, howler monkeys and other mammals, apart from sloths, were shot. Mammals which were shot or which were cap tuned by ISPA were bled by cardiac puncture. Otherwise, sloths were bled from the brachial vein; rodents, bats and marsupials from the netroonbital sinus, and binds from the external jugular vein. In the field, whole hepaninized blood was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 2 hours of collection. Plasma was aseptically separated from hepanin ized blood either by centnifugation on by overnight settling, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen until transfer to electric freezers. Whole blood was stored at â€”60Â°C,and plasma at â€”20Â°C. Virus isolation attempts Heparinized whole blood (0. 1 ml) was inoculated onto tube cultures of Vero cells, which were main tamed at 35Â°Cand observed for 14 days. Neutralization tests Test viruses included the four sylvatic flavivi ruses known to occur in Panama: YF virus (French neutrotropic strain); SLE virus, stnain Buena Vis ta-7 , isolated from Panamanian mosquitoes in 1956; Bussuquana (BSQ) virus, strain GA-7, from Panamanian mosquitoes captured in 196 1; and Il heus (ILH) virus, strain Guat-245 , isolated in 1956 from Guatemalan mosquitoes. Mayano (MAY) vi rus, an alphavirus, was included as an antigen to control for non-specific plaque reduction, since it is antigenically distinct from the four flaviviruses; it was also included because its natural transmis sion cycle is thought to be similar to that of Neo tropical jungle YF virus. We used MAY strain Pan Ar 443 isolated in 1974 from Panamanian mosquitoes. Plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) tests were basically performed as described@ Briefly, plasmas were screened 1:8 against 40â€”250 (generally 50â€”100)plaque forming units (pfu) of challenge virus. Guinea pig serum at a final con centration of 1:60 was incorporated in the virus plasma mixture as a source of fresh serum factor. The mixtures were incubated at 4Â°Covernight be fore inoculation onto 2 cm2 Vero cell monolayens. A second overlay including neutral red followed 2 on 3 days after the initial overlay, which varied in composition for each virus. To enhance plaque clarity, Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium re placed the original basic nutrient medium in ILH virus tests; gum tnagacanth was used in various combinations with either aganose or agar in fla vivinus overlays. Plasmas reducing plaque counts by at beast 80% were retested in serial dilutions; 90% plaque ne duction by plasma diluted 1:16 was considered positive. Plasmas positive against any one flavi virus were subsequently titrated against all four flavivinuses with approximately equal test virus doses, for comparison of PRN titers. Low plasma quantities reduced the number of screening anti gens in tests of some animals. RESULTS Virus isolation attempts No flaviviruses were isolated from 45 Bradypus and 14 Choloepus. Other viruses isolated from these animals are described elsewhere. 15 Antibody titers and test specificity Ninety percent plaque reduction serum titers of 1:8 were considered negative because they wene not reproducible. Also, in other di'5 titers of 1:8 have been associated with low level inhibition of two or more unrelated viruses, suggesting broad spectrum non-specific activity. Ninety percent ne duction by plasmas diluted 1:16 was therefore considered positive, but most positive titers were at beast as high as 1:64. The frequency distribution of sloth antibody PRN titers against SLE virus are shown in Table 1, and are representative of positive reactions seen in this study against other togaviruses and in other vertebrates. A possible problem of cross-reactions between the four senobogically rebated flaviviruses was re solved by experimental demonstration of the spec ificity of sloth antibodies against SLE@ and by the infrequency of multiple reactions and con fusing titers in this study. In multiple positives, differences in titer as little as 4- on 8-fold occurred so rarely as to be insignificant, and in these cases, antibody was considered specific against the an tigen of higher titer for simplicity. Sloth plasmas were never positive against more than two of the four test flaviviruses.

Of 14 multiple flavivirus reactions involving sloths pos itive against SLE virus, 12 consisted of only a 1:8 reaction against another flavivirus, with the SLE virus titer higher by at beast 16-fold (Table 1). Only two sloth plasmas were considered to be pos itive against both SLE and another flavivirus. However the titers were 4- and 8-fold respectively higher against SLE virus than the other agent (ILH virus). The specificity of PRN reactions was as clear in most cases involving other flaviviruses and forest vertebrates as it was for SLE virus and sloths. No multiple positives were seen in three sloth plasmas positive against ILH virus and two anteaters and a bird positive against SLE virus. Of 12 monkeys positive against YF virus (titers 1:32â€”1:512, mc dian 1:128), eleven did not react with any other flavivirus even at a 1:8 plasma dilution. The twelfth monkey reacted at 1:128 against YF virus and 1:64 against SLE virus, and probably was infected by both agents. Three of four ILH virus antibody-positive plas mas from agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) were multiple flavivirus positives. Although reactions against ILH virus were always strongest (1:128- 1:1,024), titers against BSQ virus in three plasmas were only 2-, 4-, and 16-fold lower than against the corresponding ILH titers. Reactions against YF virus were 8- to 64-fold bower than those against ILH virus in two agouti phasmas. The inclusion of MAY virus, an ahphavirus, in the battery of test antigens proved useful in con trolling for non-specific plaque inhibition. The number of double alpha- and flavivirus positive plasmas was not greater than that expected by chance double infections. Yellowfever virus Only primates reacted specifically against YF virus (Table 2). Of 14 howler monkeys, A. villosa, from MajÃ©,only five juveniles did not have PRN antibody against YF virus; these five animals were born after the 1974 sylvatic YF wave had already passed through MajÃ©.Other MajÃ©monkeys spe cifically inhibiting YF virus antigen include two marmosets, Saguinus geoffroyi, and one night monkey Aotus trivirgatus. YF antibody was not detected in plasmas from 33 adult Bradypus, 16 adult Choloepus or any other non-primate species collected at MajÃ©4â€”26months after active YF transmission there. At El Llano-CartI, another forest locality which had suffered a sylvatic YF wave within 6 months previous to collection of plasmas, 9/15 adult howler monkey plasmas were positive against YF virus, in contrast with none of 10 adult Bradypus and none of three adult Choloepus sloths.

The other was a radio-marked in fant Choloepus at Cerro Azub; it developed spe cHic PRN antibody against SLE virus between 17 September 1974, when its plasma titer was <1:8, and 6 November, when the titer was 1:32. Its mother also showed a significant rise in SLE an tibody titer during this period, from 1:8 to 1:32. Plasmas were tested in parallel and were uniform by negative against the other three flaviviruses. The baby was still attached to the mother, which was not lactating at either capture.

Three of eight agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, from MajÃ© were specifically positive against ILH virus; and a fourth reacted to high titer against both ILH and BSQ viruses (Table 2). Bussuquara virus The only plasmas positive against BSQ virus were also positive to higher titer against another flavivirus. Mayaro virus The only species collected at MajÃ©with detect abbe neutralizing antibody against this virus were agoutis, D. punctata, and howler monkeys A. vil losa (Table 2). The median positive titer was 1:128 (range 1:32â€”1:512).AtAguacate, none of 14 Bradypus or 15 Choloepus was positive against Mayaro virus. DISCUSSION Interpretation of these results is facilitated by the paucity of flavivirus cross-reactions. Positive tests were usually monospecific in all species cx cept agoutis, and in the few cases of multiple pos itives, titers were almost always clearly higher against one particular flavivirus than against the other three. The rarity of hetenologous flavivirus reactions in sloths experimentally infected with SLE virus'4 fits well with these field data. Our results support the working hypothesis that New World sylvatic YF virus is a monkey virus. No evidence was found to suggest alternate hosts. 860 SEYMOUR, PERALTA, AND MONTGOMERY Prolonged non-fatal experimental YF viremias of high titer in B. variegatus have been uniformly followed by the development of neutralizing an tibody,1' but no neutralizing antibodies were de tected in adult Bradypus from two areas recently affected by sylvatic YF. Therefore, it is logical to infer that if any Bradypus sloths were naturally infected, their viremias were not long nor of high titer, and that this species did not amplify the transmission of YF virus. On the other hand, our results indicate a high prevalence of natural SLE virus infection in sloths of both species. The vertebrate hosts in tropical SLE cycles are not well understood. Previous iso lations from tropical vertebrates include strains from birds, an opposum, armadillos, two rodent species and a three-toed sloth,20 and from mites combed from a rice rat.2' At MajÃ©,specific anti body against SLE virus was found more frequent ly in sloths than in any other species or group of vertebrates tested. By itself, this observation sug gests that sloth antibody is useful as the best index of the past occurrence of SLE virus in a given area. However, in combination with the demon stration of high prolonged SLE viremias in both sloth species,'4 the serological evidence of natural infection suggests that sloths are important natu ral hosts of SLE virus. Their remarkable abun dance in tropical forests is little recognized but is epidemiologically important. Their density on Barro Colorado Island in Panama has been esti mated at 8.5 Bradypus and 1. 1 Choloepus pen hectare,1 and our unpublished data using identical techniques at Cerro Azul indicate similar densities and proportions. The lack of antibody against SLE virus in young animals may be interpreted as evidence that sloths are infected very infrequently, and gradually ac cumulate a high percentage of positives in a pop ulation only because of their long life span and slow population turnover. However, lack of an tibody in young animals may also be interpreted as evidence that SLE virus had not been active in the areas studied for 2 years or more. Little is known of the epidemiology of Neotropical SLE virus, and it may follow the pattern of intermit tent waves or wandering foci as classically seen for Neotnopical YF virus.22 In this case, dense sloths populations would be important sources of SLE virus. The recent isolation of SLE virus by Dr. F. P. Pinheiro from a Brazilian Bradypus tn dactylus is interesting in this respect.2Â° The observations of antibody against ILH and MAY viruses in agoutis D. punctata are intnigu ing but difficult to interpret. Antibody against MAY virus in howler monkeys agrees with pre vious observations on the ecology of this virus.23 The high titers and lack of double positives at a frequency higher than predicted by chance mdi cate that the results are specific. ILH virus has previously been isolated from binds in Panama.24 A final intriguing point found in these field re sults is the apparently nearly simultaneous SLE virus infections of the radio-marked Choloepus mother-baby pair. Either they were both infected by mosquito(es), or one infected the other with SLE virus by contact or aerosol, as observed for a baby Bnadypus and its experimentally infected mother. â€˜@ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Victor Herrera, George Bar nett, and Ruben Vflchez for their expertise and endurance in field work; to Magaly Ojeda, to John Walsh and the International Society for the Pro tection of Animals, and to Dr. Pedro Galindo and the staff of the Gorgas Laboratory Bayano Field Station, for the collection of blood samples from MajÃ©;to Julio Cisnenos and Eduardo Miranda, for their laboratory skills; to Dr. Thomas P.

To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belong- ing to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCR–positive bat species are considered abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats. To our knowledge, this study is the first study conducted in southeastern Mexico to identify DENV-2 in bats by a widely accepted RT-PCR protocol. The role that bats play on DENV’s ecology remains undetermined. Dengue fever is an important public health concern in the tropics,1–4 and ecological and epidemiological studies are needed to assess the role of bats and other mammals in a possible sylvatic maintenance cycle.5 Dengue viruses (DENVs) comprise four antigenically distinct but genetically related serotypes of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family).1 DENVs are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause one of the most common infectious diseases in humans in tropical regions.2 Their transmission includes an urban endemic/epidemic cycle between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans as the reservoir host and a sylvatic enzootic cycle between non-human primates and arboreal mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.3 The urban cycle is well-documented in the Neo- tropics, with four serotypes reported in urban areas,1–4 whereas the sylvatic cycle has been shown in West Africa and peninsu- lar Malaysia.5 Thus far, the sylvatic cycle has not been described in the Neotropics. However, in Bolivia, DENV sero- conversions among the indigenous Ayoreo people were found in a remote area where Ae. aegypti, the primary vector, was absent.6 This finding suggests a possible sylvatic cycle involving a different mosquito species or cross-reaction with antibodies to another flavivirus. In French Guiana, all four DENV sero- types have been identified by molecular methods in 92 wild mammals (bats, rodents, and marsupials) in all settings investi- gated: periurban, rural, and sparsely populated areas.7 This finding suggests that primarily urban DENV strains could infect wildlife in non-urban forested areas.7 The role of wildlife in DENV transmission remains unknown. Bats are important reservoirs of many viruses, such as rabies viruses, Nipah viruses, and coronaviruses.8–12 Flaviviridae are the second most frequently reported viral family in the order Chiroptera (13% frequency; second only to rhabdoviruses)9; however, their role in the dynamics of DENVs remains poorly understood. DENV have been reported in large frugivorous bats (Pteropus genus) in Australia.13 More recently, polymer- ase chain reaction (PCR) and antigen detection (direct immuno- fluorescent assay) of DENV were described in bats from DENV-endemic islands in China.14 Seroconversion in bats (DENV-1, -2, and -3) has been reported in urban areas in Costa Rica and Ecuador.15 Bats captured during a dengue fever outbreak along the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of Mexico were found to beDENV-seropositive (enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay [ELISA]), have DENV NS1 protein, and be positive on reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR for DENV-2.16 Molecular evidence of DENV-1, -2, and -3 in bats from French Guiana was reported, including a phylogenetic sequence from a Carollia perspicillata bat consistent with DENV-1.7 Qualita- tive detection of the NS1 antigen of DENVs in bat serum samples and plaque reduction neutralization tests has been reported in bats from southeasternMexico from disturbed sites near human settlements in Campeche (S. Cabrera-Romo and others, unpublished data) and Mérida,17 which is the largest city in the Yucatan Peninsula. In this study, samples were collected from bats trapped in two biosphere reserves located in southeastern Mexico. High bat diversity and large tracts of continuous forest characterize these areas. Additionally, DENV-1, -2, and -4 have been reported in human populations. The aim of this study was to show the presence of DENV serotypes in bats within the biosphere reserves and adjacent areas with anthropogenic changes using RT-PCR. Bats were collected in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (Chiapas; 16 °9¢46² N, 90 °41¢18² W) and Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (Campeche; 18°26¢1² N, 89°36¢61² W) from two landscape types categorized as undis- turbed forest (UD), comprised of primary forest with no human disturbance, and disturbed forest (D), defined as a transitional zone between primary forest and agricultural/ livestock areas or human settlements. In both regions, the sites were located at least 20 km from significant human populations where dengue has been reported (Xpujil in Campeche State and Benemérito de la Américas in Chiapas State). Bats were *Address correspondence to Jesús Sotomayor-Bonilla, Universidad 3000, Colonia Ciudad Universitaria, México, Distrito Federal, Mexico 03310. E-mail: chuchomayor16@gmail.com 129 captured using four mist nets (5 + 9 m) in foraging sites. Nets were opened at dusk and remained open for 4 consecutive hours. Each site was sampled three times between November of 2010 and August of 2011. Field guides were used for the taxonomic species identification of all bats captured.18 In total, 146 bats were euthanized following the Guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists for the Use of Wild Mammals in Research19 with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Subcommittee of the Veterinary Fac- ulty of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. One hun- dred forty-six spleen specimens were collected and preserved in liquid nitrogen, and RNA from all samples was extracted using TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was carried out for DENV (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) as described previously using highly specific and sensitive primers.20 The DENV-positive control strains used in the RT-PCR for DENVs (D1/AO/XX/1988 Angola, D2/CR/ 13538/2007 Limón, D3/CR/14532/2007 Corredores, and D4/ DM/814669/1981 Dominica) were donated by the Dengue Reference Center, Instituto Costarricense de Investigación y Enseñanza en Nutrición y Salud (INCIENSA; Costa Rica). Nuclease-free water was used as a negative control. RT-PCR products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with Gel Red (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). Pos- itive and negative controls resulted as expected. Samples from 16 bat species were analyzed. Six DENV-2– positive bats were detected (prevalence of 4.1%; 95% confi- dence interval ± 3.22) (Table 1). In Calakmul, four bats were PCR-positive: two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus. Two bats, G. soricina and A. jamaicensis, were captured in the UD sites, and two bats, G. soricina and A. lituratus, were captured in a D site. In Montes Azules, two A. lituratus were positive to DENV-2: one bat from a UD site and one bat from a D site. These three bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) are considered highly abundant bat species in the Mexican Neo- tropics,21–23 coinciding with the relative abundance found in this study (A. lituratus: 179 [22%]; G. soricina: 118 [14.5%]; and A. jamaicensis: 111 [13.6%]). No significant difference was detected comparing the presence of DENV-2 and the type of site (UD and D) using a test of equal or given propor- tions in R24 (c2 = 0.1738, degrees of freedom = 1, P = 0.6768). This preliminary study provides additional evidence of DENV exposure in Neotropical bats.7,15–17 Unfortunately, because of sample degradation, we could not amplify a differ- ent region of the viral genome for phylogenetic analysis from the positive samples. Although DENV infection was sero- logically recognized in 26 bats of the same three species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) from Merida City,17 this detection is the first detection of the DENV-2 genome by molecular diagnostic methods in bats from south- eastern Mexico. DENV-1, -2, and -3 have been reported in bats from French Guiana by RT-PCR, where DENV was found in A. planirostris and C. perspicillata.7 Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, DENV-2 was identified in Myotis nigricans, Carollia sowelli, andA. jamaicensis.16 However, this detection is the first molecular detection of the DENV-2 genome in A. lituratus and G. soricina. Old World DENV-2 strains diverged relatively recently and spread to the Neotropics by human carriers and the transpor- tation of infected monkeys and mosquitoes.5 The encroach- ment of human settlements and agricultural areas on UD areas could promote new interactions among DENV vectors and potential hosts, increasing the possible development of sylvatic DENV.5 Large-scale research of anthropogenic change and pathogen evolution using an epidemiologic framework is vital to develop comprehensive policies across public health, economic development, and conservation biology.5 This study adds additional evidence for the presence of DENV-2 in three bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina). However, the extent to which bats are involved in DENV transmission and their ability to act as competent hosts remain undetermined. Because these species are the three most abundant species in the region, we may be seeing random spillover into dead-end hosts. Understanding the ecology of DENV in bats is important before implicating bats as a threat to public health. Sylvatic DENV in any species could evolve from biological interactions between wild reser- voirs and sylvatic vectors.5,7 Lastly, it may arise from socio- economic factors, such as human encroachment into natural areas in locations where medical and health services are absent.25 Future investigations of DENV in Neotropical bats and other potential wild reservoirs will improve the under- standing of the ecological dynamics of these viruses in nature.

Suss-2007-Tickborne encephalitis in naturally.pdf	Dispatches.indd Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 905 Tickborne Encephalitis in Naturally Exposed Monkey (Macaca sylvanus) Jochen Süss,* Ellen Gelpi,*† Christine Klaus,* Audrey Bagon,* Elisabeth M. Liebler-Tenorio,* Herbert Budka,*† Bernhard Stark,*‡ Werner Müller,*§ and Helmut Hotzel* We describe tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in a monkey (Macaca sylvanus) after natural exposure in an area at risk for TBE. TBE virus was present in the brain and could be identifi ed as closely related to the European subtype, strain Neudoerfl . Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a zoonotic disease caused by TBE virus (TBEV), a fl avivirus. There are 3 subtypes of TBEV, the European subtype, transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes ricinus, and the Far Eastern and Siberian subtypes. Except in Austria, where mass vaccina- tion campaigns were organized, the incidence of TBE in humans has increased in the past 30 years in all European countries with regions with risk for the disease. The aver- age increase of TBE in 10 European countries was 311% from 1974–1983 to 1994–2003 (1,2). In Germany TBE in- cidence has increased enormously during recent years. Most TBE group viruses use rodents as maintenance and amplifying hosts. TBE is predominately reported in hu- mans, seldom in dogs and horses, and is as yet unknown in monkeys.The clinical progress of TBE is typically biphasic. In humans, a nonspecifi c infl uenzalike illness develops as the fi rst phase of illness 7-14 days after they are bitten by a TBEV-positive tick. A second phase, with central nervous system involvement, develops in ≈30% of patients. Initial signs and symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, and radiculitis. The case-fatality rate is 1%–2% in central Eu- rope and 20%–40% in Siberia and the Far East. The Study On July 14, 2006, staggering paresis of the hind legs, incoordination, and intermittent opisthotonos developed in a female barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus). No nystag- mus was present. The monkey, born April 27, 2005, was from a group of ≈200 animals living in 3 social groups. The animals were kept in a large, outdoor enclosure of a monkey park situated in a TBE-risk area in southern Ger- many. Four days after the onset of clinical signs, the animal became comatose and was euthanized. Blood was collected before euthanasia, and serum was prepared. At necropsy, no macroscopic lesions were observed. The brain was removed and immediately frozen on dry ice and sectioned in 2-cm slices. Alternating slices were placed in 3.5% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C. After 48 h, rep- resentative areas, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, were embedded in paraffi n. Sections (3–5 μm) were cut from each block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for standard histopathologic evalua- tion. For immunohistochemical detection of TBEV antigens, a noncommercial rabbit polyclonal hyperimmune serum (di- lution 1:1,000) was used as described previously (3). Histologic examination of the brain tissue could be satisfactorily performed despite moderate artifacts caused by freezing (Figure, Panel A). Moderate perivascular in- fl ammatory cuffs and slight diffuse infi ltration of brain pa- renchyma by mononuclear cells were observed in almost all brain areas, including basal ganglia and cerebellum (Figure, Panel B). In addition, slight mononuclear infl am- matory infi ltrates were present in the meninges. Microglial nodules were not detected. Immunohistochemical testing demonstrated several anti-TBEV immunoreactive neurons and processes, mainly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex (Figure, Panel B), and to a lesser extent in pyrami- dal neurons of the temporal cortex. Single neuronophagias were also observed. From the frozen material, 10 samples of brain tissue were selected for PCR analysis, including cerebrum, cer- ebellum, and brain stem (Table). Viral RNA was extracted from brain tissue with RNeasy Kit and from cerebrospinal fl uid with QIAamp Viral Kit (both from QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The brain tissue was homogenized by bead- milling (Retsch, Haan, Germany) with 3-mm stainless steel beads in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer, and the QIAshredder sys- tem (QIAGEN) was used to improve homogenization. A modifi ed nested reverse transcription–PCR (nRT-PCR) was conducted with primer pairs Pp1, Pm1 (reverse transcrip- tion and fi rst PCR), and Pp2, Pm2 (nested PCR) (4). Am- plifi cation was done in a 50-μL reaction volume containing 10 μL 5× buffer, 2 μL deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (10 mmol/L), 2 μL enzyme mix (all from QIAGEN), 2 μL RNase inhibitor (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), 1.25 μL primers Pp1 and Pm1 (20 pmol/μL; Jena-Bioscience, Jena, Germany), 27.5 μL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)–treated water, and 4 μL RNA extract. The reaction was performed in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) thermal cycler for 30 min at 60°C for RT and 15 min at 95°C for denaturation as the initial step, followed by 40 cycles of PCR with 30 s *Friedrich-Loeffl er-Institute, Jena, Germany; †Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; ‡Affenberg Salem, Bodensee, Germany; and §Labor ALOMED, Radolfzell, Germany DISPATCHES 906 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 at 94°C, 30 s at 66°C, and 1 min at 72°C. Final extension was 10 min at 72°C. The second amplifi cation reaction was carried out with 4 μL of amplifi cation product in a 50-μL reaction (25 μL Taq PCR Master Mix [QIAGEN], 1.25 μL of each primer Pp2 and Pm2 [20 pmol/μL], and 18.5 μL DEPC-treated wa- ter). After a denaturation step of 2 min at 95°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C and 30 s at 65°C were performed, followed by 10 min at 72°C. PCR products (178 bp) were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and ethid- ium bromide staining. Bands were cut out, and DNA was extracted by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIA- GEN). DNA sequencing was conducted by cycle sequenc- ing, using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplifi cation primers Pp2 and Pm2 were also used as sequencing primers. Nucleotide sequences were determined on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Six of the10 brain samples were positive and CSF was negative for TBEV by nRT-PCR (Table). The sequences of these 6 PCR products (178 bp) differed by only 1 nt from that of strain Neudoerfl , the prototype strain of the Euro- pean virus subtype. The serum was tested for whole specifi c TBE antibod- ies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and IgM) by ELISA (5). Solid- phase bound antigen and antigen conjugate were from a commercially available test kit (Immunozym FSME, Pro- gen, Heidelberg, Germany). As standards, negative and positive test serum samples were used, and the following limit values were defi ned: <5 U/L, negative; 5–7 U/L, bor- der line; 9–14 U/L, weakly positive; >14 U/L, positive; and >50 U/L, strongly positive. The serum of the macaque de- scribed in this paper was positive for specifi c TBE antibod- ies (24 U/L) Conclusions Experimental infections of macaques with TBEV and related fl aviviruses (Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Powas- san virus) have been reported (6–8), but natural infections with TBE virus have not been reported previously. In our case, clinical signs, neuropathologic fi ndings, and immuno- histochemical detection of TBEV antigen in neurons and of TBEV by nRT-PCR indicate that the macaque succumbed to natural TBEV infection.

Tickborne Encephalitis in Naturally Exposed Monkey Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 6, June 2007 907 nodular pattern of lesions in the brain was not observed, the distribution of viral antigens was comparable to that observed in fatal human TBEV infection with a short clini- cal course. The TBEV was characterized as closely related to the European prototype strain Neudoerfl , which suggests that the infection was acquired locally by infected ticks. This fact is surprising because macaques generally quickly remove ticks during social grooming. The monkey park where the animal became infected is situated in southern Germany, close to the Bodensee (Bodenseekreis). This area, fl anked on the west by an area at high risk for TBE (Kreis Konstanz), is also at risk for TBE. From 1999 to 2006, a total of 29 autochthonous clini- cal cases of TBE in humans were reported in the Bodens- eekreis and 35 in the Kreis Konstanz (Hellenbrand W., pers. comm.); 19% of unvaccinated forestry workers in the Bodenseekreis and 15% in the Kreis Konstanz were sero- positive for TBEV (9). The prevalence of TBEV in ticks was 1.2%–2.3% in the Bodenseekreis (10). Retrospective analyses of anamnestic data from the affected monkey park show that TBE may have appeared sporadically in macaques in the past. A monkey died in September 1995 and another in May 2006, and TBEV anti- gen was subsequently detected in brain tissue from the fi rst animal and antibodies to TBEV were detected in both ani- mals (12 U/L and 46 U/L, respectively, by ELISA). These 2 cases have not been systematically evaluated. Clinical signs of encephalitis were observed in another animal in 1999, but it seroconverted (42 U/L, ELISA test) and re- covered after 2 months. Thus, TBE should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of encephalitis in mon- keys kept outdoors in areas at risk for TBE. Further sero- epidemiologic studies are planned to determine the status of TBEV infection among animals in this German monkey park. Vaccination against TBEV should be an option to protect other macaques in the group. Acknowledgments We are grateful to Angela Dramburg and Sabine Lied for skillful technical assistance.

It is also important n the Far East and in other parts of Asia. Vaccination can effec- ively prevent TBE. Protective vaccination is indicated for persons nhabiting or visiting TBE areas who have an increased risk of tick ites. For this purpose, it is necessary to know where TBE virus ccurs, where vectors are a potential hazard, and where as a con- equence autochthonous TBE cases have been registered. Unlike yme borreliosis endemic regions, TBE risk areas are distributed in a atchwork pattern, sometimes the situation remains stable, some- imes changes occur due to altered climatic conditions or other actors. This review is an update of an earlier one on the same topic Süss, 2003). The principal vectors of TBE virus (TBEV) are the hard ticks Ixodes icinus and I. persulcatus. I. ricinus has the primary role as a vec- or of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus of TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib which epresent different subtypes of TBEV. In some areas of Siberia and he Far East, where I. persulcatus is not the predominant species, ther hard ticks, Dermacentor reticulatus, D. silvarum, and Haema- ∗ Corresponding author.

In China, TBEV has been isolated from H. concinna and I. ovatus. Zoonotic tick-borne diseases are an increasing health burden in Europe, and there is speculation that this is partly due to cli- mate changes affecting vector biology and pathogen transmission (Gray et al., 2009). Currently, individual aspects of tick activity (Gray, 2008) and distribution (Danielová et al., 2008) as well as the distribution of risk areas (Danielová et al., 2010) suggest an influ- ence of the climate. The remarkably high host seeking activity of I. ricinus in Berlin, Germany, in the winter 2006/07 was probably due to a very mild winter (Dautel et al., 2008), and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers might change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the later part of the year (Gray, 2008). However, the nature and significance of climate change effects on the components of TBEV ecology have not yet been fully determined. It has been reported that ticks (I. ricinus) and TBEV reach higher altitudes in the mountains, higher than in former years between 1970 and 1980 (Danielová et al., 2006; Materna et al., 2008; Daniel et al., 2008a; Holzmann et al., 2009), and spread north in Sweden (Lindgren et al., 2000; Lindgren and Jaenson, 2006; Eisen, 2008), Norway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Finland (Jääskeläinen et al., 2006), Germany (Hemmer et al., 2005; Süss et al., 2008a) and west in Austria (Holzmann et al., 2009). Nearly all these data were collected dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.007 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/1877959X http://www.elsevier.de/ttbdis mailto:jochen.suess@fli.bund.de dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.007 borne a a m k s t f t 2 s g l 2 h a t t ( t r b s T w 2 m c o T s t P c e t fi N s d ( S v e ( c A a V i ( t T p c p J.

However, there are authors who dispute the influence of cli- ate change on TBE risk areas based on the current state of nowledge (Korenberg, 2009) or hold other factors (political and ociological changes and human behaviour which influenced the ick bite exposure of humans, vaccination acceptance) responsible or the increase (or decrease) in TBE incidence (and/or distribu- ion) (Randolph, 2008; Šumilo et al., 2007, 2008a,b; Süss et al., 008b). Randolph and Rogers (2000) predicted that the expected ummer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture might pro- ressively drive the distribution of TBEV (Ixodes ticks) into higher atitude and higher-altitude regions through the 2020s, 2050s, and 080s. When previously undescribed risk areas are detected, it is often ard to decide whether these areas had already existed previously nd remained undetected due to the absence of humans or whether hey have developed recently. Risk areas can be very large, but hey can also be extremely small and contain special TBEV variants Kupča et al., 2010). The epidemiological knowledge of TBE should be updated from ime to time to provide a solid basis for recommendations with egard to protective vaccination. For an understanding of the eco-epidemiology of TBEV, some asic facts about the biology and ecology of the virus are first pre- ented. BE virus classification Taxonomically, TBE viruses belong to the tick-borne viruses ithin the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae (Fauquet et al., 005). Most members of this virus genus are arthropod-borne. The osquito-borne virus group of the genus Flavivirus includes medi- ally important viruses such as Yellow fever virus, the 4 serotypes f Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. he group of tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprises 12 virus pecies divided into 2 groups, mammalian and seabird group. In he mammalian group, TBEV, but also the louping ill virus and the owassan virus (POWV) as well as the closely related deer tick virus ause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. The Kyasanur for- st disease virus and the closely related Alkhurma virus as well as he Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus, which have also been classi- ed into this group, cause severe haemorrhagic disease in humans. one of the other members of the virus group affecting mammals, uch as the Kadam virus and the Royal farm virus, cause human iseases and neither do the members of the sea bird virus group Hubálek and Halouzka, 1996; Süss and Schrader, 2004; Gould and olomon, 2008). TBEV occurs in 3 subtypes, the European virus (previously CEE irus, Central European encephalitis virus, TBEV-Eu), the Far East- rn virus (previously RSSE virus, TBEV-Fe), and the Siberian virus previously west Siberian virus, TBEV-Sib). TBEV-Eu is closely asso- iated with I. ricinus and TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib with I. persulcatus. ccording to Ecker et al. (1999), variation in amino acids within subtype is up to 2% and between subtypes 5–6% (Lindquist and apalahti, 2008). All data gathered so far indicate that immunization of persons n clinical trials with a vaccine based on the European subtype virus strains Neudoerfl or K23) showed cross-protection against he other 2 subtypes (Holzmann et al., 1992; Hayasaka et al., 2001; akashima et al., 2001). TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe, borne by I. persulcatus ticks, are mono- hyletic (Tonteri et al., 2011). The diversity of the 2 TBEV species arried by I. persulcatus is much higher than for TBEV-Eu and has robably been evolving for thousands of years, whereas TBEV-Eu Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 3 strains in I. ricinus are very similar, do not show clear geographic clustering (i.e. strains within a given region do not form genetic groups) and occur in most TBE-endemic countries (Kuno et al., 1998; Haglund et al., 2003; Han et al., 2005; Jääskeläinen et al., 2006; Grard et al., 2007; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008). Recently, Jääskeläinen et al. (2010a) isolated TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe strains from I. persulcatus collected in the Republics of Karelia and Buryatia, respectively. TBEV-Eu, louping ill virus, and other flaviviruses transmitted mainly by I. ricinus are closely related to each other. Inexact diag- nostics for these closely related viruses can cause problems insofar as apparent detections of TBEV may really be detection of louping ill virus. This could be the case, for example, in Denmark and Norway where louping ill virus and TBEV cocirculate. I. ricinus occurs in large parts of Europe. It extends as far as Turkey, northern Iran, and the Caucasus in the southeast. I. persul- catus occurs in eastern Europe, Siberia and as far east as Japan and China. There is an overlapping zone of I. ricinus with I. persulcatus from the northern Baltics to the Urals. The western border of the I. persulcatus distribution runs through Latvia. Only I. ricinus occurs west of this border, while both tick species occur east of it. Other transition zones can be found in eastern Estonia, Karelia (Russia), and the St. Petersburg area. Sequences of the TBEV-Eu subtype have been found in Latvian I. ricinus and those of TBEV-Sib in Latvian I. persulcatus (Süss et al., 2002). Such a boundary also exists at the border between Finland and Russia with I. persulcatus occurring on the Russian side. With the exception of one tick engorged on a migratory bird in Sweden (Jaenson et al., 1994), I. persulcatus has never been detected in west- ern or northern Europe until Jääskeläinen et al. (2006) detected I. persulcatus and the Siberian virus subtype in the Kokkola region in western Finland, 300 km south of the Arctic Circle, which was the first finding of the TBEV-Sib in northern Europe. Recently, Jääskeläinen et al. (2010b, 2011) identified a new TBE endemic focus in Simo, Finnish Lapland, and an unusual combi- nation of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus ticks in an area without any evidence of the occurrence of both Ixodes tick species or any cocir- culation of different TBEV subtypes. In the TBEV-endemic areas in Russia, the 3 subtypes persist at varying prevalences in ticks in individual geographic areas. Based on the E-glycoprotein sequences, the Far Eastern subtype predom- inates in the Far East (approximately 70%) along with the Siberian subtype. In Central Russia, 90% of the isolates can be classified as TBEV-Sib, the other isolates belonging to the TBEV-Fe group. In addition, a small number of isolates of the TBEV-Eu could be detected in I. persulcatus (Karan et al., 2010). In western Russia, TBEV-Sib is predominant, followed in decreasing order by TBEV- Fe and TBEV-Eu (Karan et al., 2010). For several regions in Russia (e.g. Yekaterinburg and Kemerovo) it is suspected that within the period from 1939 to 2009, TBEV-Fe has been replaced gradually by TBEV-Sib. In 1999, a large number of fatal cases of TBE characterized by an unusual haemorrhagic syndrome were identified in the Novosibirsk region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TBEV variants clustered with TBEV-Fe, but not with TBEV-Sib, and that they also differed from the already known Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus (Ternovoi et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the number of characterized TBEV strains and isolates is very low. As an example, only a few isolates have been obtained and fully identified in Germany so far, but all these sub- strains of TBEV-Eu (Salem, Amberg) showed the highest homology with the prototype strain Neudoerfl. The other 2 TBEV subtypes have not been detected at all (Süss et al., 2008a; Kupča et al., 2010). For Asia, with the exception of Japan, only a few strain char- acterizations are available. Thus, TBEV-Fe is predominant in China where it was isolated from the cerebral tissue of patients as well 4 orne D a c b e b f e e s n t e m u t r B b i w i b ( s c t t T I f T v r ( t s w p a l S r s m c t V c T t i ( T t J. Süss / Ticks and Tick-b s from ticks (Lu et al., 2008). In Japan, the Hokkaido isolate was learly classified as TBEV-Fe (Takashima et al., 2001). Surprisingly, TBEV sequences clustering with TBEV-Eu have een found in wild rodents (Apodemus agrarius) in South Korea (Kim t al., 2008; Yun et al., 2009). In I. ricinus in Europe, TBEV prevalence in unfed ticks varies etween 0.1 and 5% and increases during the tick development rom stage to stage. Higher virus prevalences have been recorded in ngorged ticks removed from humans (Bormane et al., 2004; Süss t al., 2004) and also in unfed ticks in certain regions of the Baltic tates (Latvia, Bormane et al., 2004). One hypothesis for this phe- omenon could be the virus replication in cells of host blood in the ick during and after the blood meal, but there is no experimental vidence of this yet. Bormane et al. (2004) reported that the annual ean infection rate with TBEV from 1993 to 2002 in field-collected nfed I. ricinus adults varied between 1.7 and 26.6%. In general, TBEV prevalences in I. persulcatus seem to be higher han in I. ricinus. Bormane et al. (2004) detected TBEV prevalence ates between 0 and 37.3% in adult I. persulcatus. iology of TBE virus transmission TBEV circulates within a ‘parasitic triangle’ of interactions etween virus, vector ticks, and tick hosts and is able to persist n a given habitat over long periods of time (Nuttall, 1999). The occurrence of vector ticks and suitable vertebrates on hich ticks can become infected are crucial for virus existence n a given area. The following mechanisms of virus transmission etween ticks occur: (i) feeding/cofeeding (Labuda et al., 1993a,b), ii) transovarial transmission, and perhaps (iii) sexual transmis- ion. Cofeeding transmission is especially effective, and the virus an be transmitted through this mechanism from a feeding vector ick to cofeeding ticks even on immune hosts, while transovarial ransmission is considerably less efficient. ransmission hosts I. ricinus feeds on many species of mammals, birds, and reptiles. n contrast, the number of transmission hosts for TBEV classified so ar is low. The host species that sustain the transmission cycle of BEV are partly determined by the host preference of the involved ector tick(s). A given reservoir host for TBEV must fulfil numerous equirements when infected. The outcome of human infection depends on the virus tropism e.g. the neurotropism), the virus subtype and its pathogenic poten- ial, on the immune status of the host, its age, and its genetic usceptibility to infection. During the infection process, virus fusion ith the host cell membrane is an essential and highly complex rocess. Membrane fusion by the TBEV is triggered by the mildly cidic pH of the endosome and is mediated through the enve- ope glycoprotein E, a class II viral fusion protein (Rey et al., 1995; tiasny et al., 2002). During the viraemic phase, many extraneu- al tissues are infected (Monath and Heinz, 1996). Haematogenic pread allows different organs to be infected (spleen, liver, bone arrow) (Haglund and Günther, 2003). During this phase of the linical course in patients, the virus crosses the blood–brain barrier o invade the central nervous system (CNS) (Dumpis et al., 1999). iral replication in the CNS causes lysis of cells, inflammation, and ellular dysfunction (Dumpis et al., 1999; Maximova et al., 2009). he neuropathogenesis of TBE is a complex of interactions between he TBEV and a number of host factors that trigger the susceptibil- ty to infection and the capacity for an effective antiviral response Ružek et al., 2009; Maximova et al., 2009). Encephalitis during a BEV infection has an immunopathological basis. There is a tendency for the 3 developmental stages of I. ricinus o feed on different kinds of host. Larvae feed on animals of all iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 sizes, nymphs mainly on medium-sized to large hosts, and adults are limited to medium-sized and large hosts. There is much over- lap between the hosts of larvae and nymphs. Certain small mammal species act as the main transmission hosts, in that they are able to transmit the virus via viraemia to feeding ticks and also by cofeed- ing. The rodents Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, and Myodes spp. are important as reservoir hosts for TBEV-Eu in Europe, A. agrar- ius and A. peninsula for TBEV-Sib in Siberia, and Myodes rufocanus and Microtus arvalis for TBEV-Fe in the Far East. Waldenström et al. (2007) found that some ticks attached to birds in Sweden carried TBEV. However, the TBEV prevalence in such ticks was over than the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, detected with com- parable methodologies, and little is known about the capability of birds of functioning as reservoirs of TBEV (Waldenström et al., 2007). TBEV infections may be amplified to significant levels as a result of the aggregated questing and feeding behaviour of the vector tick larvae (Labuda et al., 1993a). At the end of the blood meal, the larva detaches from the host, moults, and develops into a virus-infected nymph that can in turn transmit the virus to its host. Since most transmission hosts are not suitable for the adult stage to feed on, larvae and nymphs are of special importance for TBEV transmission. The development of I. ricinus from one generation to the next (egg to egg) can take as long as 2–6 years, but averages 3 years (Gray, 1991) and within this long time period, the virus can persist in the various tick stages and can also be transmitted. Even if the virus can infect a particular animal and replicate and disseminate in this host, this does not mean that the host is effective in transmitting the virus to feeding ticks. The viraemia of TBEV-infected goats, for example, is generally very short and of low intensity but this differs from animal to animal. Also, the time course of the shedding of the virus in goat milk is very short, between 2 and 8 days (Balogh et al., 2011). Cofeeding transmission Transmission between cofeeding ticks can occur in the absence of systemic viraemia in the host. If different developmental stages of I. ricinus feed in close proximity to each other, for example, on the ear of a mouse, the virus is, as a rule, transmitted directly from infected ticks to other (co-)feeding ticks. As the virus is transmit- ted directly, this mechanism is also very effective if the host has already developed neutralizing antibodies (Labuda et al., 1993a,b, 1997). According to the present state of knowledge and based on very sophisticated data, ecoepidemiologically cofeeding transmis- sion seems to be more common than viraemic transmission of TBEV. Labuda et al. (1996) revealed viral antigen in both migratory Langerhans cells and neutrophils. Also, migratory macrophages were shown to produce infectious virus. According to these results, the skin site of tick feeding is an important focus of viral replication early after TBEV transmission. Alimentary transmission The main route of TBEV infection of humans is a tick bite; much more rarely, the infection was transmitted by the alimentary route involving dairy products from livestock. Large domestic animals such as goats, sheep, and cattle are potential hosts for I. ricinus and may become infected by TBEV in endemic areas. These animals are viraemic over a very short period only and, as a rule, do not any show clinical symptoms. However, goats and sheep, more rarely cattle, are of special importance for the so-called alimentary acquired TBE. During the viraemic stage, the virus is excreted in milk and can be ingested orally by con- sumption of non-pasteurized milk or cheese produced from raw milk.

J. Süss / Ticks and Tick- n humans (e.g. in connection with holidays on a farm) may be he consequence. The clinical course of alimentary TBE is usually ore often biphasic than that of TBE induced by tick bite, in which nly 20–30% of the patients show a 2nd phase in the course of dis- ase. TBE in humans caused by virus-infected milk has increased ver the past decades in Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rus- ia, Albania, Austria, Czech Republic, and Hungary (Blaškovič, 1954; an Tongeren, 1955; Gresíková, 1958a,b; Levkovich and Pogodina, 958; Gresíková and Řeháček, 1959; Nosek et al., 1967; Gresíková t al., 1975; Kohl et al., 1996; Matuszczyk et al., 1997; Labuda et al., 002; Kerbo et al., 2005; Leutloff et al., 2006; Balogh et al., 2009; olzmann et al., 2009; Kříž et al., 2009). Clinical cases of alimentary BE have not been reported from Germany and Switzerland during he last few decades. In addition to transmission by tick bites and alimentary trans- ission, other routes of transmission have been described, e.g. aboratory infections (Avšič-Županc et al., 1995), blood transfusions Wahlberg et al., 1989), slaughtering of a viraemic goat (Kräusler, 981), and transmission from a viraemic mother to her baby by reast milk (Vaisviliene, 1997). oinfections It has been known for a long time that Ixodes species can arry several different pathogens at the same time, which they an also transmit to the host, e.g. TBEV, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu ato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia spp. It has also been hown that not only can simultaneous pathogen transmission dur- ng the blood meal occur, but that the host can also develop imultaneous clinical infections caused by different pathogens. Dif- erent pathogens in the same tick do not usually interfere with each ther, because they usually occupy certain different organs, tis- ues, or even cell structures that serve as specific ecological niches pathogens may be (i) mainly extracellular, (ii) mainly intracellular, nd (iii) both extra- and intracellular]. An overview of some of the ssues arising from mixed infections transmitted by ixodid ticks has een provided by Korenberg (2004). hanges in TBE epidemiology since 1990 Over the past decades, TBE has become a growing public health oncern in Europe and other parts of the world (Süss, 2003, 2008; unze and ISW-TBE, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010). TBEV is endemic in areas extending from central and Eastern urope to Siberia and parts of Asia. More and more TBEV endemic reas are being detected, especially in Asia, and therefore a large umber of new data must be expected. TBEV occurs in central Europe, the Baltic and Scandinavian ountries, and the Russian Federation. There are low-risk areas, or example, in Finland and Norway, with a trend towards both n expansion of risk areas and an increase in incidence. New oci have emerged in Denmark (Fomsgaard et al., 2009), Finland Jääskeläinen et al., 2010b, 2011), Sweden (Burenhult et al., 2002), orway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Austria (Walder et al., 2008), ermany (Süss et al., 2008b), and Switzerland (Krech, 2002). Table 1 summarizes the number of human TBE cases from 990 to 2009 in European countries with reliable epidemiologi- al information. TBE is notifiable in 15 of these countries. Over the ast 20 years, a total of 169,937 clinical cases of TBE have been egistered in Europe and Russia, with morbidity being subject to ather extreme fluctuations between countries and over time. In the eriod of observation, morbidity was highest in 1996 with 12,733 eported cases and lowest in 2008 with 5352 cases. There have een no known autochthonous cases in Belgium, Portugal, Spain, K, Ireland, or the Netherlands.

(c) TBE cases in Russia, registered 990–2009. Fig. 1a shows the number of human TBE cases in Europe from 990 to 2009, Fig. 1b without the Russian cases, and Fig. 1c the umber of TBE cases in Russia alone. Surprisingly, the overall incidence of TBE in 7 countries in urope increased to a very high level in 2006 (Daniel et al., 008b). The exact reasons for these fluctuations are not fully under- tood. In view of their short-term nature, a direct influence of limate change and vaccination coverage appears unlikely. The xplanation of Randolph et al. (2008), who analyzed data from 8 ountries (Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Poland, ithuania, Estonia, Latvia), involves human behavioural responses o weather favourable for outdoor recreational activities, includ- ng mushroom and berry harvesting, differentially influenced by ational cultural practices and economic constraints. Daniel et al. iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 (2008a) comes to the conclusion that the epidemiological situa- tion of TBE in the Czech Republic in 2006 was obviously affected by 2 main factors – persisting host-seeking activity of I. ricinus in the autumn and increased tick-bite risk in the mushroom picking season. In 2009, increases in TBE incidence outside the range (±1 standard deviation) over recent 5 years were seen in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland; higher numbers, but not statistically sig- nificant occurred in the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Slovenia; slightly higher numbers than usual (apart from 2005 to 2006) were reported from Germany. Based on preliminary data, in Europe registered 7226 human cases of TBE in 2009 – 3721 (51.5%) of these in Russia alone. In 2008, 5352 cases had been registered in Europe – 2817 (52.6%) of them in Russia. In some central European countries (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Switzerland), the number of human TBE cases increased during the last 2 decades. The increase in TBE inci- dence shows a mean of 892 annual cases from 1990 to 1999 and a mean of 1382 annual cases from 2000 to 2009. Key epidemiological concepts Unfortunately, country data are not fully comparable because, even though many countries with mandatory notification use a case definition based on clinical and laboratory data, these defi- nitions vary between countries. Other endemic countries such as Switzerland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Norway do not have a formal case definition at all. Epidemiological data would be comparable more directly if, at least at the European level, endemic countries were to use a common TBE case definition and a com- mon definition of what should be considered an endemic area. To get developments in this direction underway, a European working group has developed a definition for both of these concepts (Süss et al., 2010). Endemic area definition An area endemic for TBEV is defined as an area with proven TBEV circulation between ticks and vertebrate hosts as determined by the detection of TBEV or the confirmation of autochthonous infections in animals or humans in the past 20 years. The development of a natural TBE focus depends on a variety of factors, including the pop- ulation dynamics of vector ticks and there hosts and the presence of susceptible host species. However, the reason for the patchy distribution of TBE is not quite clear. Korenberg (2009) summarizes a large number of pos- sible factors influencing the manifestation of a natural TBE focus, including virus prevalence in ticks, vector occurrence, and host activity as well as socio-economic and climate changes. Endemic areas of TBEV can only be characterized exactly, if all direct (virus isolation from ticks and small rodents) and indirect (serological detection of TBEV in animals, autochthonous human cases) specific virus detections within a complex natural focus were analyzed (Leutloff et al., 2006; Klaus et al., 2009; Holzmann et al., 2009). Klaus et al. (2010a) demonstrated this using as an example the natural focus of Salem, district Bodenseekreis, Germany. In this area, TBEV was detected due to the occurrence of autochthonous clinical TBE cases in humans. In 2006, a clinical TBE case in a monkey (Macaca sylvanus) of the Salem monkey park was confirmed, the TBEV strain Salem (substrain of Neudoerfl prototype virus) was isolated from the brain of this animal and retrospective analysis of anamnestic data from monkeys showed that TBE may already have appeared sporadically in macaques in the past (Süss et al., 2007). To characterize this endemic area further, the sero- borne p a s l f t a e a 2 i 1 R t t v i ( a d c d a h e 2 d a i t e 2 T c ( ( b r b a b e s p t ( i J. Süss / Ticks and Tick- revalence in monkeys of this colony (283 animals) was assessed nd was found to be 2.6%. Sheep of a migratory flock in the direct urroundings of the monkey enclosure showed a TBEV seropreva- ence of 9.0% (neutralization assay). However, no TBEV-RNA was ound in (a small number of) ticks collected in this area. In conclusion, the seroprevalence in free-ranging animals and he prevalence of TBEV in hosts can, together with human and nimal clinical TBE cases, provide further information on the eco- pidemiological situation and help describe the TBE risk in a defined rea, especially if the TBEV prevalence in ticks is low (Klaus et al., 010a,b). Within its geographic range, the virus is not equally distributed; nstead, it tends to occur patchily in local foci (Blaškovič and Nosek, 972; Jusatz, 1978; Kunz, 1992; Süss et al., 1992; Kupča et al., 2010). ecently, Kupča et al. (2010) described a TBE focus considering the emporal and spatial dynamics of the respective TBEV in its vector icks as well as its isolation and molecular characteristics. Within a ery small area, an unusually high number (9 cases) and – what s more important – severe cases of disease with fatal outcome 3 cases) occurred. The authors were able to isolate a TBEV strain nd suggested after molecular analysis that the genomic changes etected in this local virus strain may play a role in this unusual lustering of severe infections. In general, TBE risk maps cannot be regarded as 100% accurate ue to the technical difficulties of precisely determining the site of documented infection. Not only are people mobile, but so are the osts (e.g. birds, deer). These animals may transport virus-infected ngorged ticks to other parts of a given habitat (Waldenström et al., 007). Endemic foci can shift within a given area. In addition to this definition of what is an endemic area, a further efinition is in official use in Germany. A given district is a TBE risk rea if the number of confirmed TBE cases in a five-year period n that district or in the district region (the given district plus all he adjacent districts) is significantly higher than the number of xpected cases given the incidence is 1 per 100,000 (Anonymous, 007). BE case definition According to Nuttall and Labuda (2005) the incidence of clini- ally expressed forms of human TBE is dependent on 4 main factors: (i) degree of exposure to infected ticks, (ii) infection prevalence in ticks, which varies in different years and in different regions, ranging from <0.1 to 5% in Europe and from 4 to 39% in Asia, iii) concentration of infectious virus in ticks; most people receive bites from ticks carrying low doses of virus, and only about 15% are bitten by highly infected ticks, iv) virulence of the infecting TBEV strain. Thus, an estimated one clinical case occurs for every 100 people itten by ticks in regions of TBE endemicity. These calculations cor- elate well with 1.4% of people who develop TBE after knowingly eing bitten by a tick. The definition of what should be considered a case of TBE as greed between the members of the ISW-TBE working group is ased on the clinical picture of TBE, its serological diagnosis, and pidemiological factors (Süss et al., 2010). (i) Clinically, TBE often takes a biphasic course with flu-like ymptoms during the first phase, a subsequent asymptomatic eriod without fever, and signs of meningitis, encephalitis, radiculi- is, or mixed forms of any of these symptoms in the second phase. ii) The serological diagnosis relies on the detection of TBEV-specific mmunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies in serum, detection Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 7 of TBEV-specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and an increased CSF:serum index. Cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses to which the patient might have been exposed to or been vaccinated against must be ruled out by performing a neu- tralization test. Epidemiological data include the history of exposure, the patient’s vaccination status, the history of a tick bite, and the pos- sible consumption of raw milk in risk areas. Descriptive country-by-country TBE epidemiology TBE is endemic in 27 European countries as well as in Asia, notably in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and South Korea. Europe Detailed maps of TBE endemicity and descriptions of risk areas are helpful for inhabitants and travellers in order to identify the geographic risk. Based on these data, active immunization is the most effective tool for TBE prevention (Rendi-Wagner, 2004). If we additionally consider TBE incidence (number of TBE cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year, in this case based on the number of inhabitants in 2008) in 2005–2009, the most important European countries where vaccination is highly recommended for all persons who plan a vacation involving contact with nature, are (in descend- ing order of TBE incidence in the whole country) Slovenia (14.07), Estonia (11.10), Lithuania (10.59), Latvia (8.76), the Czech Republic (7.02), Switzerland (2.15), Sweden (1.99), Slovakia (1.16), Austria (0.94, but see section on Austria below!), Poland (0.66), Hungary (0.60), Germany (0.44), and Finland (0.39). Russia has one of the highest TBE incidences (whole country), however, there are large endemic, but also large non-endemic areas. TBE risk occurs in other countries also, but is variable. Thus, almost the entire country of Norway can presently be visited without being exposed to a TBE risk; only one small focus exists at the southern tip of the country with TBEV-infected ticks and some human cases, which should not be entered unvaccinated. In Sweden, there are many non-risk areas, but also distinct known risk areas in a patchy distribution. Special problems are faced by travellers living in non-risk coun- tries visiting risk areas and return to their countries of origin, in some cases during the incubation period of TBE. Thus, 5 known cases of clinical TBE were registered in the USA from 2001 to 2008 where exposure and infection had taken place in Eastern Russia, Siberia, Sweden, China, and the Czech Republic (Granger et al., 2010). This publication shows that TBE in non-endemic regions (New World) is usually registered as an Old World and Asian disease problem. Albania Natural foci are found throughout Albania, but according to early reports, endemic areas are concentrated in the southern districts of Pėrmet and Gjirokastėr. These reports show a TBEV antibody preva- lence of 22% in selected sera of farmers. Alimentary cases of TBE have also been reported. Before 1990, 25 new cases were registered every year (Eltari, 1991). Since then, no data have been published. Austria Before the annual TBE vaccination campaign was introduced in 1981, Austria had the highest recorded TBE morbidity in Europe, with up to 700 hospitalized cases per year (Kunz, 2002, 2003). The increase in vaccination coverage since 1981 has led to a 8 J. Süss / Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 tute f s t w a v o p r ( r C o t c a i t v ( t t 1 a p t e W A t o B 9 Fig. 2. TBE cases in Austria from 1979 to 2009 (data from the Insti teady decline in TBE incidence (Fig. 2). In 2008, 88% of Aus- rians had received at least one TBE vaccination, and 67% were ithin the officially recommended vaccination schedule (Kunze nd ISW-TBE, 2008a,b). Fig. 2 shows the influence of this very high accination coverage, namely a drastic reduction of the number f TBE cases since the beginning of the mass vaccination cam- aigns. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a mean of 74 cases were eported annually, an incidence rate of 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants Virusepidemiologische Information, 2009). In 2009, 79 cases were egistered. The regions most affected by TBE are the provinces of Styria, arinthia, and Upper Austria, the southern part of Vienna, and parts f the Burgenland. In 2003, new endemic areas were described in he region around Mattsee, Wallersee, and Thalgau north of the ity of Salzburg. New risk areas have also been found in the Inntal nd the Zillertal as well as in Vorarlberg, notably in the surround- ngs of Feldkirch. In 2008, a series of TBE cases due to milk-borne ransmission demonstrated for the first time that I. ricinus, the TBEV ector, is present at altitudes of more than 1500 m above sea level Holzmann et al., 2009). On the basis of epidemiological data available from Austria due o an excellent TBE surveillance system that has been in place for he last 30 years, the considerable risk of acquiring TBE of about per 10,000 man-months of tick exposure can be estimated for n unvaccinated tourist staying for 4 weeks in a highly endemic rovince (Styria, southern Austria) (Rendi-Wagner, 2004). Based on the number of tourist overnight-stays in Austria during he summer, about 60 travel-associated cases of clinical TBE can be xpected to occur among unvaccinated visitors to Austria (Rendi- agner, 2004). The high risk of contracting TBE in many areas of ustria is masked by the high vaccination coverage of the Aus- rian population, which, despite the continuously high prevalence f TBEV in ticks, has led to a substantial reduction in disease burden. elarus Almost the entire territory of Belarus is endemic for TBE, with 6 oblasts – or 71.5% of all administrative districts –being consid- or Virology, Medical University Vienna, Austria, with permission). ered risk areas. The highest TBE incidence is found in the Brest and Grodno oblasts, followed by Minsk City. In 2003, 25 clinical cases were reported in the area of Minsk (Karaban et al., 2009). In the decade 1998 and 2007, the number of registered cases ranged from 19 in 2002 (incidence rate, 0.18 per 100,000) to 108 in 2006 (1.11 per 100,000). Overall, 523 cases were registered from 1998 to 2007, corresponding to a mean annual case number of 52 (Karaban et al., 2009). Between 10 and 15% of all cases registered from 1998 to 2007 concerned children younger than 14 years (Karaban et al., 2009) – a proportion substantially lower than in the 1970s, when con- sumption of raw goat milk was considerably higher than it is today. Despite the high level of endemic TBE, information on clinical cases in Belarus is scarce. Bosnia Even though there have been some cases in the northern parts of the country, including alimentary infections, details have not been published (Süss, 2003). Croatia Previously, only one natural focus in the northern part of the country was described, between the rivers Sava and Drava (Zagreb, Koprivnica) (Borcic et al., 1999). Around Križevci and in the north- east of Osijek, the risk of infection seems very high. Other ‘new’ risk areas occur along the Adriatic coast and on islands between Istria and Dubrovnik in the south. From 1998 to 2007, the annual number of cases ranged from 12 to 38. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a mean of 24 cases were reported annually. Czech Republic TBEV is endemic in all parts of the country. From 2003 to 2009, the annual average was 681 autochthonous cases. In the Czech Republic, there is a high risk of acquiring a TBE infection by tick bite.

Also, isease incidence has been high near the town of Plzeň in the west- rn part of the country. Recently, TBE foci have also been identified n the northern part of the province of Bohemia. In the east of the ountry, incidence has been high in the area of Olomouc. Clinical ases of TBE are notified between April and November every year, ith a peak in July (Beran, 2004). Recent reports suggest that the altitude distribution limits of oth I. ricinus and TBEV have changed from 700 m to about 1200 m bove sea level, notably in the Giant Mountains (Danielová et al., 006; Materna et al., 2008). Currently, the alimentary route of transmission of TBEV ccounts for only 0.9% of cases (Beneš, 2006). From 1997 to 2008, total of 64 clinical cases of alimentary TBEV transmission were eported. enmark The island of Bornholm has long been known for being a TBE isk area. From 2001 to 2008, 30 patients with TBE were diagnosed n Denmark. A total of 22 acquired the infection on the island of ornholm and 8 during visits to other well-known TBE-endemic reas outside Denmark (Laursen and Knudsen, 2003; Mølbak et al., 009). In 2008, one clinical case was reported (Mølbak et al., 2009). rom 2008 to 2009, the first 2 TBE cases acquired outside Born- olm were reported, both in North Zealand (Fomsgaard et al., 009). The level of TBEV prevalence in ticks on Bornholm is similar to hat seen in other European countries where TBEV is endemic. On he island of Bornholm, TBEV and the louping ill flavivirus have een found to coexist in I. ricinus (Jensen et al., 2004). stonia In Estonia, infection with TBEV can occur across the country, ith both of its main vectors, I. ricinus and I. persulcatus, present nd carrying the virus. TBE cases have been registered in each of the 17 administra- ive districts of the country. However, the risk of infection varies etween regions, as reflected in the mean incidence rates. For xample, from 2000 to 2007, incidence rates ranged from 30 to 83 er 100,000 in Saaremaa–the highest level of morbidity through- ut Estonia, whereas incidence rates in Ida-Virumaa were from 9 o 45 and in the range of 20 in Hiumaa, 16 in Vörumaa, and 6 in allin and surroundings (Vasilenko et al., 2002; Epstein and Kutsar, 009). Countrywide, the highest incidence rates were noted in 1997 27.8 per 100,000). From 2004 to 2007, incidence rates ranged from 0.4 to 13.5. From 2004 to 2008, the average number of TBE cases eported in Estonia was 149. By 2008, the incidence rate (6.7) had eturned to the level observed in the early 1990s (6.5). In 2009, 179 ases of TBE were registered (Epstein and Kutsar, 2009). The highest morbidity (53.5%) in this period was among people ver the age of 40. The proportion of TBE cases in children aged –14 years was 16.0%. The percentage of cases transmitted via the limentary route was 2.2% in 2004, 29.3% in 2005, and 8.8% in 2006. n 2007 and 2008, no alimentary cases were reported (Epstein and utsar, 2009). inland In Finland, a record number of 41 cases were registered in 2000 Han et al., 2002). From 2004 to 2008, an average of 22 cases was eported annually. So, in Finland, the incidence of clinical disease is ow. The known endemic areas are situated mainly in Åland (66% of Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 9 125 cases reported from 1987 to 1997, 80 per 100,000 population in 2000), on the archipelago of Turku (10%), and in the Kokkola (6%) and Lappeenranta regions (5%). The coastal areas of Turku and Kum- linge island (Åland archipelago) bear the highest risk of infection. Anti-TBEV antibody analyses suggest that 1 in 5 Ålanders becomes infected during his or her lifetime. Cases have also been identified on an island close to the city of Helsinki (Han et al., 2001). Two new endemic areas were identified recently, i.e., Varkaus in the east and Simo on the Gulf of Bothnia, 100 km south of the Arctic circle, so far the northernmost TBE risk areas (Jääskeläinen et al., 2010a). France Some cases have been reported from the Alsace region, and sin- gle cases of TBE infection have been documented from the region of Nancy, Lorraine. New cases have been reported recently from Faverges and Grenoble (Süss, 2003). From 2000 to 2009, 38 clinical cases of TBE were registered. Germany Since 1992, usually between 100 and 300 autochthonous clini- cal TBE cases were recorded annually (Fig. 3). There is no trend of change since 2000 apart from 2 unusually high years in 2005 and 2006. An all-time high was reached in 2005, when 431 cases were reported. This was exceeded by an additional increase in 2006 with 546 cases. In recent years, a decrease in reported cases was seen, with 238 cases in 2007, 285 cases in 2008, and 314 cases in 2009. From 2004 to 2008, the average number of reported cases was 355 (Anonymous, 2004–2008). The highest numbers of autochthonic TBE cases were seen in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, with 2454 cases registered 2001–2009 (85.9% of all cases in Germany). These Federal States were followed by Hesse with 190 cases (6.6%) and Thuringia with 40 cases (1.4%). In the remaining 11 Federal States (with the excep- tion of Bremen), isolated cases were registered but did not lead to a classification of the respective district as risk area. Interestingly, isolated cases were also diagnosed in northern Germany, in areas where no TBE cases had been detected previously (Hamburg, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein). The virus also seems to have Fig. 3. TBE cases in Germany from 1990 to 2009.

Süss / Ticks and Tick-b f all registered clinical TBE cases were reported from ‘non-risk’ reas. Whereas the incidence of TBE in Baden-Wuerttemberg and avaria has remained on a consistently high level for years, increas- ng incidences have been reported in other areas of Germany, such s the Odenwald (Süss et al., 2004). Currently, 136 of the 440 German districts are classified as TBE isk areas. In 2009, 3 new risk areas, i.e., Unterallgäu, Oberallgäu, nd Memmingen, were identified (Anonymous, 2010). reece In Greece, isolated clinical cases of TBE have been reported in the orth of the country, in the Thessaloniki region. A 2007 study by avlidou et al. provided detailed seroprevalence data (ELISA-IgG) in ealthy blood donors from the northern parts of the country. Thus, .8% of unvaccinated volunteers in the province of Chalkidiki, 3.6% n Evros, 2.7% in Imathia, 2.4% in Kastoria, 1.6% in Kaval, 5.4% in ell, and 2.9% in Xanthi were IgG-positive (Pavlidou et al., 2007). owever, these data were not confirmed by neutralization test, nd so, these serological data could refer to Greek goat encephalitis irus. ungary The average yearly incidence rate from 1977 to 1996 was 2.5 per 00,000 inhabitants (range 1.3–3.8), with the highest incidences rom 1981 to 1990. From 1997 to 2002, a significant decrease in he number of registered TBE cases was observed, with an incidence ate of 0.5 per 100,000 in 2000. From 2004 to 2008, an average of 6 cases was reported annually. In 2009, 64 cases were reported Balogh et al., 2009). Extended high-risk areas are located in western Hungary and long the Danube, i.e. in the counties of Zala, Somogy, and as (western Hungary), Nógrád (northern Hungary), and around ake Balaton (National Institute of Health, Budapest, Hungary, 007). The significance of alimentary route of the TBEV has again een illustrated by an event observed in Hungary in 2007. In akhegy, western Hungary, 31 of 154 persons having consumed on-pasteurized goat milk developed clinically manifest TBE; in 25 f the 31 patients, TBE was also detected serologically (Balogh et al., 009). taly A few clinical cases have been recorded in northern Italy in the rea of Florence, Trento, and Belluno. Anti-TBEV antibodies have een found in about 1% of persons exposed to potential risk, such s foresters, hunters, woodcutters, and gamekeepers (Cristofolini t al., 1993). In 2006, the first cases were reported in Friuli Venezia iulia, with one taking a lethal course (Ruscio, 2009). Since the arly 1990s, 2–34 cases were reported annually, with 23 cases in 004, 14 in 2006, 34 in 2008, and 32 in 2009. The natural foci in taly continue to remain endemic at low incidence levels, but with trend upwards. Thus, 1990–2000, a mean of 6 cases of TBE were eported annually; 2001–2009, a mean annual number of 19 cases as registered (D’Ágaro et al., 2009). atvia From 1990 to 2000, Latvia was a country with one of the high- st TBE incidences in the world. Since then, the annual number f reported cases has dropped considerably from an average of 59 cases 1990–1994 to an average of 243 cases from 2001 to 005. 2004–2008, a mean of 183 cases annually were reported. iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 In 2009, 328 cases were registered (EpiNorth Database, 2010). In 1993, annual incidence rates quadrupled compared to the mean level of the previous 2 decades (nearly 8 cases per 100,000 pop- ulation), reaching the highest levels in 1994 and 1995 at 53 cases per 100,000. Since 1999, the incidence has been significantly lower, down to 6.5 cases in 2002, but back up to 15.7 per 100,000 in 2003. From 2004 to 2007, countrywide incidence rates ranged from 6.2 to 10.8. TBE risk areas are spread across the entire country, although there are differences in virus load in ticks. Generally, the risk of infection in Latvia is high, and only the southeast is less severely affected. TBE cases have even been reported in and around the city park of Riga, a very important recreation area for many inhabitants of the capital of Latvia. Food-borne outbreaks (caused by dairy products, mainly goat milk) accounted for up to 5% of total annual cases (Lucenko et al., 2004). Ticks in Latvia have been reported to carry a higher TBEV load than ticks in other risk countries (Bormane et al., 2004). Lithuania TBE is present in all districts of Lithuania (Han et al., 2002). From 2004 to 2008, a mean of 317 cases of TBE were reported annually. In 2009, 617 cases were registered. The highest annual incidences of TBE are recorded in the north- ern and central parts of the country, i.e. mainly in the counties Kaunas, Panevezys, and Siauliai. In these 3 regions, 17–32% of total annual case numbers have been registered. In 2003, the incidence rates in these areas remained unchanged, but increased substan- tially in many other counties. Eight of 44 districts reported a 2–5 times higher incidence rate than the average incidence in Lithuania. The highest incidence rate was recorded in Panevezys, with about 100 per 100,000 inhabitants (Asokliene, 2004). Generally, the epidemiology of TBE in Lithuania in 2003 was highly unusual. The incidence rate (763 cases, 22 per 100,000 inhabitants) was more than double the average incidence over the previous 10 years (347 cases annually) and the highest ever recorded since notification began at the end of the 1960s. Also, it was the highest of all the Baltic countries in 2003. Four lethal cases of TBE were notified in 2003. In 2004, a total of 425 hospitalized cases were reported (Asokliene, 2004). 2004–2007, incidence rates ranged from 6.9 to 13.5. Even though mostly transmitted through a tick bite, 22 cases of TBE in 2003 (4 clusters) were acquired by consumption of unpas- teurized goat milk. Moldova Although there are no reliable data, it is assumed that TBE is present (A. Movila, pers. comm.). Norway In Norway, TBE was first reported in 1998. All of the 44 cases that occurred in Norway from 1998 to 2009 were acquired within a limited area along the southern coast, mainly in the municipality of Tromøy (Blystad et al., 2009). Most patients were infected in East and West Agder counties. A study carried out among regular patients attending a health centre in Tromøy showed an anti-TBEV antibody seroprevalence of 2.4% (Skarpaas et al., 2002). In previous studies, IgG antibodies to the TBEV had been found in 0.3–0.4% of persons from different parts of Agder county, a region where TBE had not been seen previously (Csango et al., 2004). borne P r r r I m s b d G e S h T t o o a w R t u c R e S R 1 e i r c ( f o t o c i ( n r S w d n t t e n b P v J. Süss / Ticks and Tick- oland Since 1993, the number of reported cases at country level has anged from 100 to 350 cases per year. In 2003, the number of eported cases was 339 (0.89 per 100,000). In 2006, 316 cases were eported. From 2004 to 2008, 237 cases were reported annually. n 2009, the case number was 335 (P. Stefanoff, pers. comm.). The ost important risk areas are located in the northeast of the country tretching from Podtachia to Brest, in the border region in the east etween Bialystok and Suwalki, in wide areas of the Masurian lake istrict, including Olsztyn, and along the Baltic sea around Gdańsk, dynia, and Elblag. High-risk areas also occur along the northwest- rn border of Poland, stretching along the Vistula river and from zczecin to Gorzow Wielkoposki. In southern Poland and in Silesia, ighly endemic areas are found around Opole and Stalowa Wola. here are also a few small areas in Poland where the virus appears o be rare. The north-east of the country around Bialystok is the main area f endemicity (Grygorczuk et al., 2002). Eighty percent of cases ccurred in the 2 north-eastern provinces adjacent to Lithuania nd Belarus. Another important focus of the disease is in the south- estern part of Poland, in districts adjacent to the Czech Republic. omania A risk for TBE is reported for Transylvania at the base of he Carpathian Mountains and the Transylvanian Alps. There are nconfirmed reports that clinical cases of TBE occur across the ountry, some of alimentary origin (Molnár et al., 2008). ussia TBE is endemic from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. The high- st morbidity rates have been registered in the Ural, Perm, and verdlovsk regions (13.4 per 100,000 of population; Udmurt epublic: 53.5 per 100,000; West Siberia, Tomsk region: 72.5 per 00,000; East Siberia, Krasnoyarsky Krai: 37 per 100,000) (Karan t al., 2010). After 1999, when 9955 cases were reported, the number of TBE nfections decreased continuously, reaching an all-time low of 3098 eported cases in 2007. From 2004 to 2008, on an average 3642 ases were reported annually. In 2009, 3721 cases were diagnosed Fig. 1c). The fact that TBE incidence in Russia decreased continuously rom 1999 to 2009 and that on the other hand in certain regions f the country, it has been increasing steadily is not a contradic- ion. Thus, 1997–2009, the incidence rate of TBE in the province f Arkhangelsk increased from 1.4 per 100,000 to 11.2 (climate hange?) (Karan et al., 2010). The most dangerous foci of TBE have been found to be located n the southern Okhotsk region with its dark coniferous forests Leonova and Somov, 1989) and in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range ear Vladivostok (Leonova and Borisovets, 1990). In the Primorye egion, the far-eastern part of Russia along the coast of the ‘East ea’ (Sea of Japan), 126 persons were hospitalized and diagnosed ith TBE between from January to August 2004, 17 of them chil- ren. A total of 8 fatalities were reported. From 1996 to 1999, the umber of TBE patients in the Lake Baikal region ranged from 460 o 780 per year and showed a trend towards an increase. The rela- ive index per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 2.6 to 18.1 (Titenko t al., 2002). The Sverdlovsk region has long been known to be a natural idus of TBE. The majority of cases have been reported in Yekaterin- urg. Other foci are in Nizhni Tagil, Kamensk-Uralsky, Verkhnyaya yshma, Nizhnyaya Tura, Nevyansk, and Sukhoy Lo. The main TBEV ector in the Asian and European parts of Russia is I. persulcatus. Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 11 Lethal TBE outcomes have been registered in Siberia (Irkutsk region and Krasnoyarsk territory) and in the European parts of Russia (Yaroslavl region) (Pogodina and Bochkova, 2004). The northwestern parts of Russia are popular destinations for tourists from Western Europe, the Baltic countries, and Scandi- navia. The TBE incidence rate ranges between from 0.7 to 1 in and around St. Petersburg, 0.1–0.4 in Murmansk, 8–11.6 in Karelia, and 0.9–1.3 in and around Kaliningrad. In Russia, mixed infections after a tick bite are frequent. For example, in the Kemerovo region, up to 48% of ticks were found to carry 2 or more pathogens, with a wide variety of pathogen combinations and mixed infections (e.g. Borrelia and TBE; Borre- lia and human monocytic ehrlichiosis; Borrelia, TBE, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, etc.) (Poponnikova, 2010). Serbia A few TBE cases have been reported in the area near Belgrade, including food-borne outbreaks near the Adriatic coast, but there is no published information available on these cases. Slovakia The TBE risk areas have been known for a long time. From 1961 to 2004, 1786 clinical cases of TBE were registered, i.e. 40 cases annually (Lukan et al., 2010). More recently, from 1998 to 2007, the average annual number of reported cases was 65, rang- ing from 46 to 92. In 2009, 71 cases were registered. Some of these were caused by consumption of homemade raw goat or sheep milk. The known risk areas, where the highest numbers of clinical TBE cases have occurred, are located in the southwest of Slovakia and along its southern border. Most risk areas are situated in the Carpathian Mountains, in the southern subcarpathian regions, and in the Pannonian lowlands. New small foci, e.g. around Košice, have been identified in areas of eastern Slovakia traditionally thought to be free of TBEV (Labuda et al., 2002). Slovenia Although endemic foci of TBE are spread across the country, they are mainly concentrated in the central part and in the Alps, partic- ularly around the cities of Kranje and Trzic, and in the south around Ribnica and Kocevje. The risk of infection is particularly high in and around Ljubljana and Celje (Jereb et al., 2006). From 2001 to 2005, the 5-year average in the number of TBE cases was 261. The highest case number was reported in 1994, with a total of 762 cases. In 2006, 373 cases were registered. From 2004 to 2008, an annual mean of 264 cases was reported. In 2009, 307 cases were registered. In recent years, incidence rates were 12–14 per 100,000 inhabitants. Sweden TBE epidemiology in Sweden is characterized by continuous increases in incidence, an expansion of classical risk areas, and the detection of new foci. From 1990 to 1999, an annual mean of 68 cases had been registered, from 2000 to 2009, the annual mean number was 155 cases. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, the annual average was 173 cases. The highest number of cases in recorded his- tory was registered in 2008, with a total of 224 cases (M. Haglund, pers. comm.). In 2009, 211 cases of TBE were reported. From 2004 to 2007, incidence rates were 1.5–2.4 per 100,000. In 2003, most infections were acquired in the counties of Stock- holm (56%), in the adjacent coastal regions in Södermanland (15%), and in Uppsala (6%).

In the county f Västra Götaland south of Lake Vänern, 5–10 cases are notified nnually, with a trend towards an increase in case numbers. In the est of Sweden, sporadic cases occur every year. A few scattered ases have been reported from Dalsland and Bohuslän in the west nd Skåne and Blekinge in the south of Sweden (Burenhult et al., 002). More recently, during 2007–2009 there were three human BE cases recorded in the province of Dalama, one case in 2008 in he province of Västerbotten (about 600 km north of Stockholm), nd another case in 2009 in the province of Ångermanland (T.G.T. aenson, pers. commun.). witzerland and Liechtenstein In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a mean of 169 cases was eported annually. In 2006, 259 cases were reported, the highest in ecorded history in Switzerland. In 2009, 118 cases were registered T. Krech, pers. commun; Bundesamt für Gesundheit, 2007). There re 2 high-risk regions, the larger one covering the midland, with he exception of the far-western part, and the smaller one located in he upper Rhine valley, including the principality of Liechtenstein. A ocus of ticks infected with the TBEV is located on a much-used for- st path near Vaduz, the capital of the principality (Aberham et al., 992). The canton Zürich has become the most dangerous region for BE in Switzerland (Krech, 2002), followed by Thurgau, St. Gallen, argau, and Bern. The TBE risk areas in the northeast of Switzerland ave remained stable, but risk areas in western Switzerland have eveloped, i.e. Neuchâtel. kraine The TBE foci are located throughout the entire mountain forest one of Crimea and in Volinskij. They correspond to the habitat f I. ricinus, the main vector of TBEV (Evstaf’ev, 2001). Natural foci lso exist in the northwest of the country. From 1980 to 1990, about 00 patients with TBE were recorded in Crimea, where coinfections ith TBEV and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus have been ound (Markeshin et al., 1992). More recent data are unavailable, ith unofficial reports indicating about 50 cases annually. sia In recent years, reliable data from Asia have become available, howing that TBEV is also endemic in a number of non-European ountries, such as Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Japan, nd South Korea. However, because notification of TBE cases has ot been mandatory, diagnostic tools have been underused, and wareness of the disease is low, the epidemiological picture is still atchy. hina Even though endemic, TBE is not a notifiable disease in China, hich is why information on endemic areas is incomplete. TBE isk areas have been identified in northeastern, northwestern, and outhwestern China, with the main endemic areas located in the rovince of Heilongjiang in the northeast of the People’s Republic. rom 1980 to 1998, 2202 cases of TBE were registered. From 1995 o 1998, 420 infections were diagnosed and the seasons with the ighest numbers of reported cases were May (44 cases) and June 210 cases). The main vector of the disease is I. persulcatus (Süss, 003; Lu et al., 2008). In rarer cases, Dermacentor silvarum has been dentified as a carrier of TBEV (Lu et al., 2008). iseases 2 (2011) 2–15 Japan In 1993, a case of TBE was reported from the southern part of Hokkaido. Since 1995, TBEV has been isolated from the blood samples of sentinel dogs, tick pools, and rodent spleens. A seroepidemiological survey performed among humans and ani- mals showed that TBEV may be endemic in Japan, at least on the Island of Hokkaido (Bröker, 2002). The main vector on Hokkaido was identified as I. ovatus, and genomic sequence and phylo- genetic analyses of a virus isolate showed a close relationship with TBEV-Fe (Takashima et al., 1997; Takashima, 1998). I. per- sulcatus is also a common species in this area (Takashima et al., 1997). Kazakhstan Kazakhstan has long been suspected to be endemic for TBE. Endemic areas are focused in the eastern parts of the country and in the region of Almaty. In eastern Kazakhstan, 34 cases of TBE were reported in 2004, 28 in 2005, and 18 in 2006. In the sur- roundings of Almaty, the corresponding figures were 10, 9, and 6. In the city of Almaty, 6 cases were reported in 2004, 12 in 2005, and 8 in 2006. Overall, 245 clinical cases of TBE were reported in Kazakhstan from 2004 to 2009 (Deryabin, 2010). People bitten by a tick in Kazakhstan get treated by passive immunization against TBEV (Deryabin, 2010). In the province of Aksu, virus antigen was detected by ELISA in cow milk. Risk areas in Kazakhstan appear to spread far beyond currently known endemic areas, with virus antigen detected in ticks using ELISA (Zhambyl region, Kyzyl-Orda region, eastern Kazakhstan). Overall, therefore, the number of unreported cases is believed to be much higher. Kyrgyzstan As yet unpublished data on the presence of TBEV in small mam- mals (Alticola argentatus, Apodemus spp., and Microtus spp.) suggest that the virus is endemic in Kyrgyzstan. Preliminary results suggest that in Kyrgyzstan TBEV-Sib is predominant. Clinical cases have not been reported yet (Atkinson, 2010). Mongolia In 2004, some endemic areas were described close to the Rus- sian border in the north of the country (provinces of Selenga and Bulgan) and around the capital city Ulan-Bataar based on indirect, serological evidence (Walder et al., 2006). In 2008, a first patient died with diagnosed meningoencephalitis, the virus was isolated from the brain and characterized. The virus was genetically closest related to the TBEV-Fe subtype (Khasnatinov et al., 2010). South Korea In South Korea, TBEV has recently been isolated from ticks (Haemaphysalis longicornis, I. nipponensis) and mice (Apodemus agrarius) and, surprisingly, was found to be TBEV-Eu. The virus has been isolated in the areas of Dongducheon, Geyonggi- do; Jeongseon, Gangwon-do; Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do; and Gurye, Jeonrabuk-do. Cases of TBE have not been registered, but there have been several CNS diseases of unknown origin which are currently being followed up (Kim et al., 2008). Conclusion All the data presented here clearly demonstrate the importance of TBE for the individual as well as for the health care systems of borne t l A h d m R A A A A A A A B B B B B B B B B B B B C C D D D D D J.

Takashima-1998-Epidemiology of tick-borne ence.pdf	PII: S0147957197000246 Epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis in Japan Ikuo Takashima Laboratory of Public Health, Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060, Japan Received 29 September 1997 Abstract A tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient has not been reported for many years in Japan although a serological survey of domestic animal sera suggested the presence of TBE foci in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe encephalitis case in a farm wife was diagnosed as tick-borne encephalitis. Serological examination of paired sera showed a rise of neutralization (NT) antibody titer to Russian spring summer encephalitis virus. A sero-epizootiological survey of dogs showed that the TBE-related virus was prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the blood of sentinel dogs and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-related viruses. Sequence analysis of envelope protein gene identi®ed one of the isolates as the same subtype as Russian spring summer encephalitis (Far-Eastern TBE) virus. The results provide the evidence that TBE is endemic in a certain area of Japan. # 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The family Flaviviridae includes nearly 70 antigenically distinct viruses, many of which cause severe illness in humans and animals [1, 2]. Ecologically, they are divided into mosquito- and tick-borne viruses. The latter comprise a complex of viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), louping ill, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest fever, and Powassan encephalitis virus [3, 4] (Table 1). They were often called TBE complex because of antigenic similarities. Like mosquito-borne yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, TBE virus represents one of the major human pathogenic ¯aviviruses causing thousands of cases of severe neurological disease per year. TBE is thus a signi®cant public health problem in endemic areas of Asia and Europe. Two subtypes of TBE virus, Western (central European) subtype and Far-Eastern subtype (prototype; Russian spring summer encephalitis virus strain Sofjin) are prevalent on the Eurasian Continent [5, 6]. The latter subtype is known to be highly pathogenic to humans with a mortality rate of about 30% or more [7]. This article gives brief information of TBE in general and the epidemiological survey results of TBE found recently in Japan.

Transmission cycle of TBE virus in nature TBE virus circulates in nature as represented in Fig. 1. The virus is passed from adult ticks to eggs by transovarial transmission and is further transmitted trans- stadially from one stage to the next. Persistence of the virus in nature requires a large population of both small mammals and ticks. The virus foci are very stable for years unless the ecological conditions are changed either by man or nature. The virus can be transmitted to man or other hosts by larvae, nymphs or adult ticks. Larvae and nymphs acquired the virus from infected small mammals and birds. Vector tick species of TBE virus Western subtype is known as Ixodes ricinus and that of Far-Eastern subtype as Ixodes persulcatus. But other species of ticks can serve as the vector of TBE virus. Besides the main transmission route by the tick bite, humans may acquire the infection by drinking raw milk from goats, sheep and cows. 3. History and present epidemiology Illness of the TBE Far Eastern subtype was ®rst reported in Russia in 1937 during an epidemic in southern Far East, and the causing virus was isolated from the brain of an encephalitis patient [8]. Similar encephalitis was described in Czechoslovakia in 1948 during an epidemic in Central Bohemia, and TBE virus Western subtype was isolated [9]. TBE cases are reported in Europe and north Asia. In the 1990 s, total annual TBE numbers were 6000±10 000 cases among which 5000±7000 cases have been reported from Russia [10]. The largest number of cases in recent years was observed in the Ural and in western Siberia where incidence rates reached 2.7±6.5 and 3.0±4.0 per 100 000, respectively [11, 12]. In Fig. 1. Transmission cycle of TBE virus. I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±90 83 the 1950s and 1960s, cases occurred mainly in rural areas, but in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, more than 70% of reported cases were in urban dwellers [12]. 4. Background information of TBE in Hokkaido, Japan Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, is located close to the Maritime Province of Siberia in Far Eastern Russia, in which TBE is prevalent. Both areas, once connected by land, share the same biogeographical and ecological environments. Ixodes persulcatus, vector tick of TBE virus in Siberia, is a predominant species in Hokkaido; and some rodent species, reservoir hosts of the virus, are also common in both areas. From the viewpoint of an ecological setting for the virus, it is not surprising that TBE virus of Far Eastern subtype is endemic to Hokkaido. The presence of scattered TBE foci had been suspected in the area from previous seroepidemiological surveys in 1978 using cattle sera [13]. In 1993, a case of human viral encephalitis was diagnosed as TBE in Kamiiso, the southern part of Hokkaido. The following are the results of case ®ndings of TBE, seroepidemiological survey, virus isolation and the sequence analysis of the virus envelope (E) protein gene, in order to demonstrate that TBE is endemic in Japan. 5. Clinical ®ndings On 27 October 1993, a dairy farmer's wife in the town of Kamiiso suddenly suered a febrile illness with a temperature of 398C. She was hospitalized on the third day after the onset of illness. Double vision was reported on the second day, convulsions on the ®fth day. She was under pulmotor from day ®ve to twenty. Remaining motor paralysis of the arms and neck was present three years later. Cerebrospinal ¯uid examination at acute and convalescent phases clearly showed that she suered from encephalitis or encephalomyelitis of viral origin [14, 15]. The patient's dairy farm was located in the town of Kamiiso in the Oshima district, Hokkaido (Fig. 2). Four farms were distributed there within a 1.0 km radius. The area was deforested 50 years ago. The sera and cerebrospinal ¯uid were examined by ELISA for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (Table 2). ELISA IgG titer for JE virus increased signi®cantly from acute phase to convalescent phase. However, ELISA IgM titer essential in JE diagnosis was negative. Therefore, another ¯avivirus infection was suspected as the cause of the encephalitis in this case and a more speci®c neutralization test (NT) was performed including Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus strain JaGAr-01, Negishi virus isolated in 1948 in Japan [16], Apoi virus isolated from rodents in Hokkaido in 1954 [17], and Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus strain Sofjin. NT antibody titers increased signi®cantly to RSSE virus at acute and convalescent I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±9084 phases among the ¯aviviruses tested. The results indicated that the patient was infected with a TBE-related virus [14, 18]. 6. Epidemiological study in 1994 In 1994, a serological examination of animal sera was conducted for cattle and dogs kept on farms of a case study area to con®rm that the virus is prevalent endemically in the aected area, and to examine cow milk as a possible source of infection. Positive antibody was not detected in 54 cattle sera collected from the farm of the patient and an adjacent farm, suggesting no connection of cow milk with infection source. Dogs in the area were selected as indicator animals based Fig. 2. Geographical location of a case study area, Kamiiso (R).

Sera of nine dogs from four farms in the aected area were collected in July 1994, and NT titers were determined to JE virus, RSSE and Langat viruses of tick-borne encephalitis complex (Table 3). Eight out of nine dogs showed signi®cantly higher titer to RSSE virus than JE virus. Although titer to Langat virus was lower than RSSE virus, it was higher than JE virus. The results showed that the TBE-related virus was prevalent in the area. Comparison of NT titers to three ¯aviviruses demonstrated that Langat virus could substitute as assay virus instead of the highly pathogenic RSSE virus. A serological survey was extended to the residents of the aected area. Five human sera, including four family members of the patient and a neighbouring farmer, were tested. Negative titer (<1:20) was obtained from four family members to Langat virus. However, the neighbouring farmer's serum had speci®c NT titer to RSSE virus (1:100). He had suered severe encephalitis clinically suspected as JE 35 years ago and was hospitalized for two months. He claimed to have suered motor paralysis of the neck for one year. 7. Epidemiological survey using sentinel dogs in 1995 In 1995, 10 sentinel dogs were kept in the area in a free-living environment and the serum samples were collected once a week from April to July. NT titers of the dog sera to Langat virus were determined and virus isolation was carried out (Table 4). On 22 April all 10 dogs had a negative antibody to Langat virus. Two animals converted to positive on 4 May, three on 13 May and ®ve on 27 May. The results clearly showed that the virus was prevalent in the area in 1995.

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±9086 blood was inoculated into suckling mice via an intracerebral route. Three viral strains were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs Nos. 5, 8 and 9 which were obtained seven days prior to the sero-converted day. The virus strains from dogs Nos 5, 8 and 9 were designated as Oshima-3-6, -5-10 and -5-11, respectively. Antigenicities of the virus isolates were examined by IFA test using monoclonal antibodies supplied by Dr F. X. Heinz at the University of Vienna, Austria [19± 21]. Three of the isolates showed high titers to TBE-complex-speci®c 2E7 and TBE-type-speci®c 7G7 monoclonal antibodies [15]. The viral strains isolated were identi®ed as TBE-related virus. 8. Characterization of the virus isolates Sequence and phylogenic analysis of one of the isolates, Oshima-5-10 strain, was performed targeting the E-protein gene. The whole E-protein gene was ampli®ed by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. The sequence of Oshima virus was compared with those of TBE complex viruses (Table 5). The nucleotide identities of Oshima virus with RSSE (Far Eastern subtype) and Western tick-borne encephalitis (WTBE) were 95.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Oshima virus showed extremely high identities of the amino acid sequences with RSSE (99.0%) and WTBE (95.8%). Oshima virus was grouped in RSSE subtype. 9.

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±90 87 1993 was diagnosed as TBE since NT titers of the patient sera were higher to TBE(RSSE) virus than other ¯aviviruses. NT titers of paired sera also increased from acute to convalescent phases to TBE virus and very low to JE virus. The patient was suspected of having acquired the virus infection in the area, and the virus may have been indigenous to the area for many years. The above assumption was made for the following reasons. (1) The patient had no history of travel abroad. (2) In the years 1994 and 1995, virus activity was clearly demonstrated in the dog population by serological examination and virus isolation. (3) The neighbouring farmer with speci®c TBE antibody was probably infected with TBE virus 35 years ago when he suered from encephalitis. (4) In 1978 we had performed a serological survey of TBE virus in Hokkaido using cattle sera and found positive areas at several foci [13]. (5) TBE virus has been shown to be endemic in certain foci for many years due to its ecological nature. The virus can be maintained in the tick trans-stadially and transovarially, and the reservoir animals are indigenous rodents whose migration is very limited. However, the above assumption that the virus may have been indigenous for many years has to be veri®ed further. Dogs and/or sentinel animals were found to be superior indicators for TBE virus survey. A high positive antibody rate was detected in dog sera from the aected area. The time of the virus activity could be monitored by consecutive testing of the sera. The viruses were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs. The viremic period of dogs was reported to be seven days before the neutralizing antibodies were ®rst detected in the serum from the infected animals [22]. No clinical signs developed in the experimentally infected dogs or in our sentinel dogs [22]. The isolated virus strains were identi®ed as TBE-related virus from the results of the reaction pattern with monoclonal antibodies, and one of the isolates was shown to be RSSE (Far-Eastern) subtype virus from sequence analysis of the E- protein gene. Monoclonal antibody 6E2 reacts widely to ¯aviviruses, 2E7 to the Table 5 Identities of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Oshima virus with those of TBE complex viruses Identity (%) Virus Nucleotide Amino acid Russian spring summer encephalitis* 95.7 99.0 Western tick-borne encephalitis 84.3 95.8 Louping ill 81.9 91.3 Spanish sheep encephalitis 81.8 92.9 Turkish sheep encephalitis 81.8 3.5 Omsk hemorrhagic fever 80.3 94.0 Langat 75.3 88.7 Kyasanur Forest disease 72.2 81.2 Powassan 69.8 78.1 * Far-Eastern tick-borne encephalitis.

The E-protein gene of Oshima 5-10 showed the closest relationship with RSSE virus. TBE virus may be endemic to areas other than the case study area in Japan. The dog sera from another district in Hokkaido showed a positive antibody to TBE virus [23]. I. persulcatus ticks were reported as a principal vector species of RSSE virus in the far eastern part of Russia. However, our tick collection study shows that I. ovatus is the predominant species in the case study area and may be the vector tick in this area [23]. Since I. ovatus tick is a common species all over Japan, epidemiological surveys should also extend to Honshyu, the main island of Japan, to reveal the extent of TBE endemicity. These ®ndings should prompt physicians to consider TBE as one of the causes of viral encephalitis and to dierentiate it from JE in an area such as Japan. JE is prevalent in many Asian countries but TBE may not have been reported because of similar clinical symptoms and a high degree of cross-reactivity in serological tests. Prompt preventive measures must be established in Japan by further studies to specify endemic areas and to develop a vaccine strategy against the prevalent TBE-related virus.

Das 390 pessoas incluídas na primeira fase do estudo (agosto de 1999), somente 190 compareceram em janeiro de 2000, três meses após a aplicação da vacina 17D (outubro de 1999). Nas amostras da primeira fase, as freqüências de soropositivos (IH) para os vírus estudados foram: 17D (27,2%); Dengue-1 (0,3%); Dengue-2 (4,1%); Dengue-3 (0%); Dengue-4 (0%), entre outros 8 vírus. Nas amostras séricas de janeiro (2000), a soroconversão para o 17D foi de 89,7% (130/145) e 3,2% (6/ 190) passaram a ter anticorpos contra o sorotipo 3 (DEN-3). Em conclusão, por conta da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal e de soroconversão há redução significativa do risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela na cidade de Rio Branco, apesar de não ser desprezível a possibilidade de uma nova epidemia de dengue, pelo DEN-3, a semelhança da registrada em 2000 e 2001 pelos sorotipos 1 e 2.

ABSTRACT During a yellow fever vaccination campaign among residents of Rio Branco (Acre State), the frequency of HI antibodies to the most prevalent arboviruses in the Amazon region and to yellow fever virus was determined before and three months after immunization with YF 17D vaccine. From 390 inhabitants included in the first phase of serologic survey (August 1999), only 190 provided a second serum sample, after the use of 17D vaccine (January 2000). Among first phase samples, the frequency of HI antibodies was: 17D (27.2%); Ilheus (5.9%); Mayaro (5.4%); Caraparu (4.9%); Dengue-2 (4.1%); Oropouche (2.3%); and Dengue-1 (0.3%). In the second study phase, the serologic conversion to YF reached 89.7% among previously negative persons. Serologic conversions were also observed to Ilheus (6.2%); Dengue-3 (3.2%); Mayaro (1.1%); and Oropouche (1.1%) viruses. In conclusion, considering the high YF antibody rate after vaccination, the risk of urban yellow fever seems insignificant, although the lower prevalence of HI antibodies to dengue viruses, is of concern and inhabitants are under high risk of dengue outbreaks, especially to DEN-3 recently introduced in Brazil, as was observed in 2000 and 2001 with DEN-1 and DEN-2.

Não obstante, na população do Estado do Acre há uma lacuna no conhecimento sobre a soroepidemiologia dos arbovírus e o impacto na Saúde Pública17, apesar das condições epidemiológicas favoráveis à circulação de arbovírus em decorrência das extensas áreas de florestas tropicais nativas e da grande biodiversidade. Nessa região do Brasil, os estudos arbovirológicos ficaram restritos às investigações iniciais sobre a Febre Negra de Lábrea6 e de tentativas de isolamento viral em animais (aves, répteis e mosquitos) coletados no município de Sena Madureira7 8. Mais recentemente, em janeiro de 2001, ocorreu a incidência máxima da epidemia de dengue pelos sorotipos 1 e 2 (DEN-1 e DEN-2) nas cidades do Vale do Rio Acre, especialmente na capital do Estado (Rio Branco). Isto, após o registro crescente de casos de dengue ao longo do segundo semestre de 20004. Anteriormente, em novembro de 1999, houve registro dos primeiros casos de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija, vizinha às cidades acreanas de Brasiléia e Epitaciolância4. Essa situação do Estado do Acre motivou o presente estudo soroepidemiológico sobre os principais arbovírus descritos na região amazônica, em uma amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco, antes (agosto de 1999) da vacinação em massa contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (17D) em 10 de outubro de 1999 e da ocorrência da epidemia de dengue em 2000/2001. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS No primeiro dia da Campanha Estadual de Vacinação contra o vírus da hepatite B (VHB), em 14 de agosto de 1999, foram selecionadas 394 pessoas residentes na área urbana da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), com 2 ou mais anos de idade, entre aquelas que compareceram a um dos 212 Postos de Vacinação (temporários) da cidade. Em cada Posto de Vacinação foi selecionada de uma a duas pessoas para coleta da amostra sangüínea e levantamento de informações demográficas e sobre a vacinação prévia contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela, após conhecer os objetivos da pesquisa e assinar o termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido. A primeira pessoa selecionada era aquela da fila para vacinação que estava sendo atendida (ainda na fase de preenchimento dos dados pessoais), quando da chegada da equipe da pesquisa ao Posto de Vacinação. Nos Postos de Vacinação com mais de 30 pessoas na fila, foi selecionada a outra pessoa subseqüente na fila, desde que não-membro da família da primeira. Quando houve recusa de alguma pessoa (no total de dois casos), foi incluída a pessoa seguinte na fila para vacinação2. Em seguida ao preenchimento do questionário, foram coletados de 8 a 10ml de sangue venoso sem anticoagulante. Em seguida, as amostras sangüíneas foram centrifugadas e estocadas (-20o C) no LACEN- AC, onde foram conservadas até o envio para o Laboratório de Arbovírus do Instituto Evandro Chagas (Belém, PA), para a pesquisa de anticorpos inibidores da hemaglutinação (IH), pela técnica de Clarke & Casals modificada por Shope21, dos seguintes arbovírus: Alphavirus da família Togaviridae (vírus Mayaro e Mucambo); Flavivirus da família Flaviviridae (vírus Ilhéus, Rocio, Dengue-1, Dengue-2, Dengue-3, Dengue-4, Saint Louis e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela, 17D); e Bunyavirus da família Bunyaviridae (vírus Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu). Esses 13 vírus, nem todos são estritamente arbovírus10, foram estudados usando soros-controles, positivos e negativos, padronizados pelo IEC (Belém, PA) e considerando soropositivo a amostra com título recíproco ≥20. Os soropositivos para os sorotipos do vírus da dengue foram considerados como resposta primária ou secundária, de acordo com os critérios da Organização Panamericana de Saúde14: ( i) primária, quando o t í tulo recíproco era <1.280 e, simultaneamente, havia ausência de resposta ou títulos 4 vezes menores para os demais sorotipos do dengue ou outros flavivírus; e (ii) secundária, títulos recíprocos iguais ou maiores a 1.280 para todos os sorotipos do dengue e/ou outros flavivírus. A segunda etapa do estudo foi realizada três (3) meses depois, entre os dias 19 a 21 de janeiro de 2000, após a aplicação da vacina contra o 17D (BIOMANGUINHOS®, Rio de Janeiro) no dia 10 de outubro de 2000 em toda a população do Estado do Acre. Oito dias antes do início da segunda etapa, todos os participantes do estudo (n=394) foram convidados, por carta, pela Secretaria de Estado de Sáude e Saneamento do Estado (SESSACRE) para nova coleta de sangue, sendo esclarecido qual o objetivo do estudo (pesquisa sorológica do marcador anti-HBs do VHB e anti-17D), e o motivo, ambos descritos em linguagem acessível ao grande público. Na mesma carta-convite, foi solicitado que a pessoa ou responsável legal levasse a caderneta de vacinação, entregue em agosto de 1999, ou atualizada em outubro e dezembro de 1999 por ocasião, respectivamente, da primeira, segunda (+ a vacina 17D) e terceira doses da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Nessa segunda etapa, após a coleta de nova amostra sangüínea, foram seguidos os mesmos procedimentos anteriores, e preenchido o segundo módulo do questionário (dados pessoais, história de vacinação nos meses anteriores e exame da caderneta de vacinação). Por ocasião da segunda etapa do estudo, ainda não eram conhecidos os resultados dos exames sorológicos da primeira amostra sérica. As análises estatísticas foram realizadas com auxílio do “software” Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Na análise dos resultados, as pessoas naturais do Estado do Acre e nascidas em municípios da região oriental foram incluídas como sendo da região do Vale do Rio Acre, enquanto que aquelas nascidas em municípios da região central e ocidental do Estado como do Vale do Rio Juruá. Para as variáveis contínuas foram determinadas a média, o desvio-padrão e a mediana, enquanto para as variáveis categóricas as medidas de freqüência. As associações foram consideradas estatisticamente significantes se a probabilidade do erro α foi ≤0,05 (p≤5%). RESULTADOS Das 394 pessoas incluídas no estudo, quatro foram excluídas porque a primeira amostra sérica foi perdida durante o processamento laboratorial ou por ocasião do transporte até Belém (PA). Na segunda etapa do estudo, somente atenderam ao convite 190 (48,7%) pessoas. Os resultados da pesquisa sorológica na 3 Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 primeira (de agosto de 1999) e na segunda (de janeiro de 2000) amostras séricas estão descritos na Tabela 1. Todas as respostas sorológicas foram do tipo primária, exceto em 21,7% (23/106) dos 17D-positivos (agosto de 1999) e que foi secundária para dois ou mais flavivírus. Na Tabela 2, foi comparado o resultado sorológico dentre as variáveis demográficas pesquisadas (sexo e idade), tanto nas pessoas com anticorpos contra o 17D (em agosto de 1999) como para o conjunto daqueles com anticorpos para os arbovírus pesquisados em agosto de 1999. Nesse último grupo, a pessoa amostrada somente foi considerada uma vez e excluindo aquelas com anticorpos para o vírus 17D. Por isto, dos 203 soropositivos (106 para o 17D e 97 para os outros arbovírus), somente foram incluídas 80 pessoas, ou seja, 17 (80 + 17=97) pessoas tinham anticorpos para 2 (n=13) ou 3 (n=4) dos arbovírus investigados. Desse modo, foi possível mostrar na Tabela 2 que antes da intervenção (vacina contra a febre amarela), havia a predominância significante (p<0,05) de pessoas soropositivas para o 17D do sexo masculino (31,9% vs 22,8%), mas que após a vacinação as freqüências (respectivamente, 93,1% vs 91,3%) de soroconvertidos foram semelhantes (p>0,62). Em relação ao estudo sorológico da amostra de agosto de 1999, as pessoas do sexo masculino foram também mais freqüentemente (p<0,005) soropositivas (26,6% vs 14,8%) para o conjunto de arbovírus. Quanto à idade, os soropositivos para o 17D em agosto de 1999 (p<0,001) e para o conjunto dos arbovírus (p<0,001) apresentaram médias de idade significativamente maiores (Tabela 2). No entanto, entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos (n=145), na amostra de agosto de 1999 e também avaliados em janeiro de 2000, foram semelhantes (p>0,46) as médias das idades dos soropositivos e negativos (Tabela 2).

Não foi estudado o tempo de residência no Estado do Acre, mas a distribuição do resultado sorológico para o conjunto dos arbovírus pesquisados teve freqüências de soropositivos semelhantes (p>0,18) quanto à naturalidade: Estado do Acre (19,6% ou 62/316); outros Estados amazônicos (16,7% ou 6/36) ou de outras unidades federadas (31,6% ou 12/38). Também, entre os naturais do Estado do Acre (n=316), não foram observadas diferenças significantes (p>0,20) nas freqüências de soropositivos (conjunto de arbovírus) entre aqueles naturais de municípios do Vale do Acre (18,3% ou 47/257) versus os do Vale do Juruá (25,4% ou 15/59). Entre os naturais do Vale do Acre (n=257), grande parte (80,9%; n=208) era da cidade de Rio Branco. O valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação prévia, em relação à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D nas amostras de agosto de 1999, foi baixo - de 30,6% (64/209) -, ao contrário do valor Tabela 1 - Freqüências de anticorpos contra o vírus vacinal da febre amarela (FA-17D) e arbovírus em moradores da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), antes (agosto de 1999) e depois da vacinação contra o 17D (outubro, 2000).

Entre os soronegativos (n=284) compareceram na segunda etapa 145 (51,1%) pessoas e do grupo de soropositivos (n=106) 45 (42,4%) atenderam o convite, sendo essas diferenças sem significado estatístico (χ²=2,78; p>0,09). Na segunda etapa, a soroconversão (três meses após a vacina 17D) foi de 89,7% (130/ 145) e os 45 soropositivos (da amostra de agosto de 1999), pesquisados em janeiro de 2000, tiveram o mesmo resultado sorológico anterior. A soroprevalência dos portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus pesquisados (Tabela 1), foi inferior a 6%, inclusive para o Oropouche (2,3%), Mayaro (5,4%) e Ilhéus (5,9%), entre outros. Chama a atenção, as freqüências de soropositivos, nas amostras de agosto de 1999, contra os sorotipos do vírus da dengue, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 e DEN-4, respectivamente: 0,3%; 4,1%; 0% e 0%. No entanto, cinco meses após (janeiro de 2000) da primeira amostra sangüínea (em agosto de 1999), todos os soronegativos (DEN-1, DEN-2 e DEN-3) pesquisados assim permaneceram, mas 3,2% (6/190) daqueles soronegativos para o DEN-3 ficaram soropositivos (Tabela 1). Em tempo semelhante, também foi observada soroconversão para os arbovírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%). 4 preditivo-negativo de 77,4% (89/115), mas as diferenças observadas (Tabela 3) não alcançaram significância estatística (p>0,24). Quando foi levantada a história de vacinação contra o vírus vacinal 17D, em outubro de 1999, e comparada à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000, o valor preditivo- positivo foi elevado de 92,1% (152/165), sendo baixo (8,3%) o valor preditivo-negativo (Tabela 3). A Tabela 3 também mostra que foi muito baixa (0,3%) a freqüência de pessoas que portavam a caderneta de vacinação, quando da primeira dose da Campanha Estadual (agosto de 1999) e que em janeiro de 2000, cinco meses após, somente 39,5% apresentaram a caderneta de vacinação, mas sendo semelhante (p>0,60) a proporção de soropositivos entre os portadores da caderneta (93,3%) e os não-portadores (91,3%). Nenhuma pessoa, com história de vacinação (17D) em outubro de 1999 e pesquisada em janeiro de 2000, referiu qualquer agravo à saúde nos três meses subseqüentes ou a algum evento adverso, relacionado à vacina, de intensidade moderada ou grave. DISCUSSÃO Esse é o primeiro estudo realizado no Estado do Acre, sobre a prevalência de portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus mais prevalentes na região Norte do Brasil17 18 19. Talvez, pela procedência e naturalidade predominantemente urbana da amostra populacional, a freqüência de soropositivos (<6%) para grande parte dos vírus estudados (Mayaro, Mucambo, Ilhéus, Rocio, Saint Louis, Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu) foi inferior à esperada, considerando os resultados de outros estudos sorológicos realizados na região amazônica17. É preciso considerar que não devem ser raros os prováveis contatos (e.g. lazer e ocupacionais) com áreas de florestas nativas, inclusive entre aqueles nascidos na cidade de Rio Branco, o que muito mais provavelmente ocorre entre os nascidos em cidades de menor porte do Estado do Acre. No entanto, o encontro de mais soropositivos (31,6% vs <20%) entre os não-naturais de Estados amazônicos, apesar da ausência de significado estatístico, pode evidenciar a maior exposição desses migrantes em atividades extrativistas ou vinculadas à agricultura ou à agroindústria. Na população estudada, a soroconversão observada para os vírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%), entre a primeira e a segunda amostra sérica, evidencia a provável circulação desses vírus ou outro(s) antigenicamente relacionado(s). Considerando as características da população avaliada, especialmente o efeito da amplitude da faixa etária e do maior contingente de naturais da cidade de Rio Branco, essas incidências, no período de 5 meses, podem ser classificadas como de valores entre médios a elevados. No entanto, na região Norte do Brasil, não há conhecimento sobre estudo avaliando a incidência de alguma infecção por arbovírus. Coerentemente, as pessoas com anticorpos para o conjunto dos arbovírus estudados foram mais freqüentemente do sexo masculino e de maior idade, evidenciando provavelmente a maior exposição dessas pessoas às áreas de maior circulação dos vírus estudados, onde são próprias para as atividades ocupacionais extrativistas, agrícolas ou de lazer (e. g. caça e pesca). Em publicações anteriores, a freqüência de soropositivos para anticorpos contra esses arbovírus aumentou, proporcionalmente, ao aumento da idade9 22 23, o que pode ter associação com o tempo de maior exposição nas atividades de maior risco para adquirir a infecção. No entanto, quanto ao sexo, as observações são variáveis conforme a população estudada22 e, talvez isto se explique, por questões de gênero ou, mais especificamente, porque as mulheres têm menos rotineiramente atividades vinculadas às áreas de floresta tropical.

No entanto, em novembro de 1999, houve os primeiros registros de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija4. Portanto, as soroprevalências dos DEN-1 (0,3%) e DEN-2 (4,1%) observadas nas amostras de agosto de 1999, provavelmente, espelham aquele momento epidemiológico. Já no ano 2000, na cidade de Rio Branco foram notificados 2.178 casos de dengue, especialmente nos meses de novembro (n=326) e dezembro (n=525), e com a confirmação de 1.283 casos (SESSACRE, dados não-publicados). Também no ano 2000, de janeiro a dezembro, os índices de infestação predial pelo Aedes aegypti na cidade de Rio Branco variaram de 0% a 16,47% (média de 3,5%), conforme o bairro pesquisado (SESSACRE-DABS, dados não-publicados). Quando do segundo levantamento soroepidemiológico (janeiro de 2000), a curva epidêmica da dengue poderia estar com a incidência de nível endêmico, mas não ainda em fase de progressão ou que pode ter começado a ocorrer no segundo semestre de 2000. Porque, não só considerando o conhecimento sobre as curvas epidêmicas da dengue23, os casos notificados foram mais freqüentes a partir de novembro e dezembro de 2000 e a incidência máxima da epidemia na terceira semana epidemiológica (janeiro) de 2001, simultaneamente pelos sorotipos DEN-1 e DEN-2, quando foram confirmados 410 dos 445 casos notificados na cidade de Rio Branco4. Mais recentemente, nas cidades de Brasiléia e Epitaciolândia, na divisa com a cidade de Cobija (Bolívia), também foram confirmados casos autóctones de DEN-1 e DEN-24. Por isto, vale ressaltar a observação dos 6 (3,2%) casos com anticorpos contra o sorotipo DEN-3 em janeiro de 2000, sendo anteriormente (agosto de 1999) soronegativos para esse mesmo sorotipo. Oficialmente, o DEN-3 foi isolado no Brasil em dezembro de 2000 na cidade do Rio de Janeiro12, seguido por isolamentos subseqüentes ou de epidemias em populações de cidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil3. Portanto, o registro de soropositivos (IH) para o DEN-3 em amostras séricas extraídas em janeiro de 2000 é digno de nota, especialmente porque foram em pessoas residentes em região distante daquelas localidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil. Contudo, vale também ressaltar, apesar do isolamento geográfico do Estado do Acre, muitas das cidades do Vale do Acre, inclusive Rio Branco, têm grande intercâmbio de pessoas e mercadorias com a cidade de Cobija (Estado de Pando, Bolívia), onde há aeroporto internacional e com possibilidade de comunicação aérea com outros centros urbanos da América Latina e onde há circulação do DEN-313. Apesar do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil recomendar, há mais de três décadas, a vacinação contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela nas populações residentes na região Norte do País, especialmente aquelas residentes nas pequenas localidades ou em áreas de floresta nativa, onde há maior risco de exposição ao ciclo silvestre do vírus da febre amarela24, somente 27,2% da população estudada tinha soroproteção contra o vírus amaralíco na amostra sérica de agosto de 1999. Isto tem ainda maior relevância, porque é sabido que as pessoas vacinadas mantém títulos de anticorpos protetores por longos períodos de tempo15, mesmo entre residentes de áreas sem programa regular de vacinação22. Por outro lado, a baixa freqüência (27,2%) de portadores de anticorpos anti-17D mostrou não só a vulnerabilidade da população ao vírus da febre amarela, antes da campanha de vacinação em massa de 1999, bem como os precários resultados obtidos com as medidas governamentais até então praticadas. No entanto, nas amostras séricas de três meses após a vacinação em massa contra o vírus 17D, em outubro de 1999, a soroconversão observada foi de 89,7% entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos. Nessa Campanha Estadual de Vacinação, do Governo do Estado do Acre e com o apoio da Fundação Nacional de Saúde, foram vacinadas 416.267 pessoas em todo o Estado, correspondendo à época a 82,6% da população estimada como não-imune (n=504.023), excluindo os menores de 6 meses de idade e as gestantes. Portanto, essas taxas de cobertura vacinal (82,6%) e de soroconversão (89,7%), bem como o contingente de pessoas previamente imunes (27,2%), tornam possível especular que a quase totalidade das pessoas residentes no Estado do Acre em outubro de 1999 esteja imune contra o vírus da febre amarela. Isto provavelmente ocorreu de modo uniforme, no grupo populacional com indicação de receber a vacina, considerando as distribuições semelhantes de sexo e idade dos portadores de anticorpos anti-17D em janeiro de 2000. Ao contrário do observado entre aqueles pesquisados em agosto de 1999, quando predominaram as pessoas do sexo masculino e de maior idade, o que pode evidenciar o efeito dessas pessoas saberem ser mais expostas ao ciclo silvestre da febre amarela e, conseqüentemente, buscaram mais a vacinação. Não obstante, seria mais indicado o teste de neutralização (TN), por ser mais sensível e específico, para avaliar a soroconversão pela vacina antiamarílica e usando como substrato cultura de células ou camundongos recém-nascidos (PFC Vasconcelos, informação pessoal). No entanto, o TN, se comparado ao teste de inibição da hemaglutinação, tem como principais limitações em estudos soro- epidemiológicos o custo mais elevado e também, especialmente se for usados camundongos recém-nascidos, o tempo despedido para conclusão dos exames sorológicos, além de requerer biotério com capacidade de fornecer grande número de animais. O custo-benefício da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal na população da cidade de Rio Branco, e por extensão do Estado do Acre, deve ser também avaliado considerando a proteção duradoura oferecida por essa vacina, ou de pelo menos 10 anos15, e o atual risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela11, o que tem merecido reiterados alertas as autoridades de saúde do Brasil5 11 16 24, decorrente da elevada dispersão do Ae. aegypti em grande parte das cidades brasileiras, à semelhança do observado nas áreas de maior densidade populacional do Estado do Acre. Adicionalmente, em todo o Estado do Acre não ocorreu aumento da incidência de encefalopatias, de encefalites ou de outro evento adverso conhecido25 nos dias subseqüentes à aplicação em massa da vacina 17D (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Entre as 416.267 pessoas vacinadas contra o 17D em outubro de 1999, em todo o Estado do Acre, somente foi notificado um caso (homem, de 26 anos, previamente sadio) que desenvolveu abscesso piogênico no local da aplicação da vacina, que evoluiu para sepse e faleceu, dezesseis dias após a vacinação, com falência múltipla de órgãos (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Provavelmente pelo efeito do viés de recordação, não houve diferença da soropositividade para o 17D entre aqueles com ou sem história de vacinação prévia a agosto de 1999. Ao contrário, possivelmente por ser um evento mais recente, a história de vacinação (em outubro de 1999) foi muito mais lembrada pelos Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004 6 soropositivos para o 17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000. Contudo, além do baixo valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação, observada no levantamento de agosto de 1999, não é hábito da população guardar a caderneta de vacinação ou mesmo levá-la à unidade de imunização por ocasião da aplicação de uma nova dose de vacina, isto porque somente uma (0,3%) pessoa a apresentou quando da aplicação da primeira dose (agosto de 1999) da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Essa situação fica ainda mais evidente ao constatar que somente 39,5% das pessoas tinham aquela caderneta em janeiro de 2000, ou seja, isto após 5 meses do início da Campanha Estadual de Intensificação do Calendário de Imunizações, que mobilizou ampla parcela da população do Estado do Acre, e com maciça divulgação nos vários tipos de mídia. Como estes resultados observados sobre a caderneta de vacinação são semelhantes aos descritos nos Estados da Bahia20 e de Minas Gerais1, há fortes indícios sobre a inadequação dessa prática de registro e, por isto mesmo, os gestores do Sistema Único de Saúde deveriam estudar melhor estratégia de registro e/ou de armazenamento de dados, de mais fácil verificação, e que cobrisse, ao menos, as vacinas constantes do Programa Nacional de Imunização. Em conclusão, a população estudada tem aparentemente menor exposição aos arbovírus mais prevalentes na região amazônica brasileira e, apesar de potencialmente mais exposta ao vírus da febre amarela, tinha, antes da campanha de vacinação, baixa taxa de cobertura vacinal contra o vírus 17D. De outro lado, os índices atuais de infestação do Ae aegypti, os determinantes econômicos e sócioculturais e a evidência sorológica de circulação do DEN-3, tornam a população do Estado do Acre potencialmente exposta a outra epidemia de dengue pelo sorotipo 3 (DEN-3).

Dublin L. 0. CLEMENTS AND M. FENLON Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Knockalisheen, Limerick INTRODUCTION LOUPING ill (LI), traditionally a disease of sheep and less frequently cattle, occurs in Scotland, northern England, Wales and Ireland. The aetiological agent is a flavivirus which is transmitted under natural conditions by the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. Although clinical LI has previously been described in the horse (Fletcher, 1937), there have been no virologically confirmed cases reported in this species. A limited serological survey to determine the prevalence of serum neutralising antibodies to LI virus in horses in Ireland, disclosed a positive rate of 10.6 per cent, indicating a moderate infection rate in animals of mixed breed and of different environmental backgrounds (Timoney, 1974). This paper contains a description of an outbreak of LI in a group of free range horses and the isolation of a virus, antigenically indistinguishable from a reference strain of LI virus, from the brain and spinal cord of one of the animals. It has already been the subject of a preliminary report (Timoney, Donnelly, Clements and Fenlon, 1974). CLINICAL HISTORY The group of horses in which LI was confirmed comprised a 12 year old (y.0.) hunter, a 3 y.0. ?,-bred mare, a 3 y.0. draft mare and a 3 y.0. h-bred mare. The animals which were unbroken and scarcely handled since they were foals, were grazing on a farm of reclaimed land in Co. Clare. Almost 15 years previously losses from LI infection had occurred in sheep on this farm. The horses involved in the present outbreak were checked daily for signs of ill health. Case I Clinical signs were first noticed in the &-bred mare when inspected at 06.30 h on 30.4.74. At rest there were generalised muscular tremors, most pronounced in the left forelimb which also tended to knuckle over. The animal moved reluctantly when approached and muscular tremors recommenced when she stopped. On the following day the mare was recumbent and when forced to rise would walk a short distance and lie down again. Five to 6 hours later, she had difficulty in rising and exhibited hyperexcitability, incoordination and opisthotonus. An hour afterwards the mare was caught for the first time and became so excited that she was given as a sedative, an intravenous injection of magnesium sulphate. She died 10 minutes later approx- imately 32 hours after the initial symptoms were detected. Case 2 At the end of April, the 3 y.0. &-bred mare developed a peculiar gait and when in motion, stretched out her neck in an exaggerated extended position. However, these clinical signs subsided in a short time. The owner felt that had the &bred mare not been sick, the transient symptoms shown by the &-bred mare would have passed unnoticed. Case 3 During the second week in May, the 3 y.0. draft mare was observed remaining apart from the other horses. The animal had been losing condition for over a month. The mare tended to lie down a lot and when roused, would adopt a dog-sitting position. Having gained her feet she would take some time steadying herself and occasionally experienced generalised muscular tremors. At times, the mare would stagger around but at no stage were hyperexcitability, opisthotonus, or paddling of the limbs evident. The mare was often recumbent during the week preceding her death which occurred on 22.5.74. The duration of the illness was approximately 10-12 days. FIN DI NGS POST-MORTEM AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL In Case 1 there were interlobular pulmonary oedema and serosanguineous pleural exudate. The meningeal blood vessels were congested. An ulcerative typhlitis associated with many Anoplocephala perfoliata was present in both cases, and was the only macroscopic abnormality observed in Case 3. The entire brain from Case 1 and one half of the brain from Case 3 were fixed in 10 per cent formol saline for histopath- ological examination. The remainder of the brain from Case 3 was immersed in 50 per cent glycerol saline for virological examination. After fixation, blocks of cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla, and cervical cord from both cases, were processed to paraffin. Sections were cut at 7 pm and were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) were typical of those encountered in viral encephalitides, namely neuronal degeneration, focal gliosis and peri- vascular lymphoid infiltration. I I4 Case I Congestion, perivascular lymphoid infiltration and glial nodules were present at all levels of the CNS examined. Glial nodules were particularly numerous in the midbrain, around the cerebral aqueduct (fig. I ) and in the red nuclei. The oculomotor nuclei were unaffected. Some of the cerebellar folia were severely involved with marked perivascular haemorrhages in- volving both the granular layer and the white matter (fig. 2) . Haemorrhages were also present in the medulla and spinal cord. EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL thalamus, cerebellar vermis, pons, medulla just anterior to the obex, and cervical cord at the level of the first cervical vertebra. The suspending medium was Eagle's minimal essential medium with 20 per cent foetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Virus isolation was attempted by the intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of each suspension into a group of 8, 1-2 day old albino Swiss mice. Fig. 3.

The midbrain was most severely affected with perivascular infiltration and glial nodules particularly in the central grey matter (fig. 3). In the cerebellum, there were areas of Purkinje cell loss accompanied by diffuse glial reaction and endothelial reactivity in the molecular layer (fig. 4). Lesions in the medulla and cervical cord were sparse. Some perivascular cuffing and satellitosis were present in the medulla and a few glial nodules in the white matter of the cervical cord. There was some post-mortem degeneration in the tissues from this case. 12 VIROLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS Virus Isolation Clarified 10 per cent suspensions were separately prepared from 6 areas of the brain of Case 2, the 3 y.0. draft mare. These included : anterior cerebral cortex. Fig. 4. Cerebellum from Case 3 showing loss of Piirkinje cells, glial reaction in molecular layer and reactive blood vessel (arrow). ( H E , x 300). Two mice in each of the 3 groups injected with pons, medulla, and cervical cord suspensions became sick 5-6 days after inoculation. Re-isolation of the virus, designated 74/E/61, from the same areas of the horse brain were successful. Weanling mice inoculated with the isolate by the i.c. and intraperitoneal routes, all developed posterior paraplegia by the sixth day post inoculation. Virus Characterisation and Identification Haemagglutinating ( H A ) activity. Crude alkaline aqueous antigens prepared from first and second passage mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 virus were tested fcr HA activity over pH range 5.8-6.8 and each was negative. However, a haemagglutinin of titre ! /320, was sub- sequently obtained from second passage infective mouse brain using sucrose-acetone and acetone-ether extraction procedures. The preparation of crude and purified antigens and the techniaue of HA titration were as deschbed by Clarke and 'Casals (1958) adapted to the , microtechnique of Sever (1962). EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL Mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid was produced against 74/E/61 virus after the method of Brandt, Buescher and Hetrick (1967). The equine isolate was preliminarily identified as a strain of LI virus using the gel diffusion (GD) test (Papadopoulos, Anslow and Hanson, 1970). Lines of complete identity were obtained with low passage mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 virus and suckling mouse brain infected with the More- dun strain of LI virus. The identity of the equine isolate was confirmed in cross complement-fixation (CF) tests (Bradstreet and Taylor, 1962) and in cross haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests (Clarke and Casals, 1958). Cross neutralisation tests were undertaken to determine the extent of the antigenic similarity between 74/E/61 virus and the Moredun strain of LI virus. The test method has previously been described (Timoney, 1974). The results of cross neutralisation tests revealed that both reference and 74/E/61 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable, with homologous and heterologous neutralisation indices differing by less than one log of virus neutralised (Table I ) .

Serological Testing Blood samples were collected from the $-bred mare and the hunter on 21.5.74 and 9.6.74 and from the draft mare on 21.5.74, the day preceding its death. Antibody to 74/E/61 virus was detected in all of the sera using the neutralisation, CF, HI and G D tests. There were significant rises in titre between first and second samples in the case of the &bred mare and the hunter (Table 11). DISCUSSION Although there is serological evidence of LI infection in horses in Ireland (Timoney, 1974), clinical disease associated with such infections is very uncommon. It is interesting to compare the clinical features of this outbreak with those described in other recorded cases of experimental or natural LI infection in the horse (Alexander and Neitz, 1935; Fletcher, 1937). In both instances, there was no attendant mortality. Alexander and Neitz (1935) experimentally infected 2 horses with LI virus by infesting them with infected Rhipicephalus appendiculutus nymphs. One animal was afebrile and showed only slight paresis, which appeared 2 weeks after challenge and persisted for several weeks. The second animal developed a biphasic fever, was anorexic, Horse ~ 3 y .0 . draft mare* ~~ 3 y.0. 4-bred mare 12 y.0. hunter I Serological Test 32 32 128 I28 _ _ _ I ~ HI 20: ~ ~ 40 40 20 80 ~ - Positive (weak) Positive Positive Positive * Horse died 22.5.74 and LI virus isolated from brain. t Protective serum titre expressed as no. weanling mouse i.c.

No nervous signs appeared and the horse made an uneventful recovery. In the clinical report by Fletcher (1937), a 2 y.0. Clydesdale colt grazing on hill pasture with 2 other horses developed stiffness in gait, especially in the hind limbs. This was accompanied by a moderate fever, marked nervous tension, head thrust forward, fore-legs lifted abnormally high when made to walk and slight twitching of the facial muscles. The colt had fully recovered after an illness of 12 days duration. Alteration in gait and thrusting forward of the head were also seen in the 3 y.0. :-bred in the present out- break. The nervous signs exhibited by the 2 mares which died were quite different and have not been previously described in LI in the horse. Whether the death of the $-bred mare after a brief illness of 1-2 days, was brought about by the intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate a short time beforehand or not, is conjectural. Certainly the fulminating character of the disease and the severity of the nervous signs which were observed, suggest that death would have supervened in a relatively short period of time irrespective of any medication. The variation in clinical response observed in this outbreak of LI infection is no different to that described for other equine arboviral diseases affecting the CNS e.g. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (Kissling, et at., 1956), Western equine encephalomyelitis (Sponseller, et al., 1966) and West Nile encephalomyelitis (Joubert, et al., 1970). The lesions observed on histopathological examination of the brains of the i-bred mare and the draft mare were typical of viral encephalomyelitis. The difference in the severity of the lesions in the 2 horses was no greater than that seen in many field cases of LI in sheep. The lack of polymorphonuclear reaction differentiated this encephalitis from Eastern equine encephalomyelitis as described by Hurst (1934). Distribution of lesions in Borna disease in which the spinal cord is not involved, and in which the oculomotor nuclei rather than the red nuclei of the midbrain are affected (Innes and Saunders, 1962), is quite different. I I6 The results of the virological investigations confirm the importance of checking several areas of the brain when attempting virus isolation. The recovery of LI virus only from the pons, medulla, and cervical cord can be compared with the finding of Doherty and Reid (1971), that in sheep experimentally infected with LI virus by the subcutaneous route, the highest concentra- tions of virus are to be found in the brain stem and spinal cord. The ability of virus to survive in brain tissue even in the presence of high levels of homologous serum antibody, has been noted previously. In acute cases of experimental LI infection in sheep, Reid, Doherty and Dawson (1971) have reported high levels of specific IgM and IgG in cerebrospinal fluid and have in every case isolated the virus from nervous tissue. The properties of 74/E/61 virus isolated from the brain of the draft mare, were indistinguishable from those of a reference strain of LI virus. Failure to ,demonstrate a haemagglutinin in a number of crude mouse brain antigens confirms the observation of Timoney (1971), that less than one third of such antigens prepared from field isolates of LI virus have HA activity. Purification of infective mouse brain by sucrose-acetone or acetone-ether extraction procedures had to be resorted to before a HA antigen was obtained. Even though no antigenic difference could be detected between equine and reference strains of virus, it is possible that 74/E/6I virus possessed biological properties enhancing its virulence for the horse. This possibility is presently being investigated. A significant rise in antibody titre to LI virus was detected by neutralisation test in the case of the $-bred mare, and by HI and GD tests in the case of the hunter. The advisability of carrying out more than one serological assay method is evident. This outbreak of LI infection when considered in conjunction with an antibody prevalence rate of 10.6 per cent in non-Thoroughbred horses in Ireland (Timoney, I974), would indicate that further studies are required to determine the importance of L1 virus in the aetiology of equine neurological disorders and to evaluate the epidemiological importance of the horse in the natural history of this virus. SUMMARY An outbreak of LI infection in a group of free range horses is described. Three of 4 horses displayed signs of CNS disturbance and 2 of these died after illnesses ranging from 2-12 days duration. In both cases a variable degree of viral polioencephalomyelitis was observed. A virus antigenically indistinguishable from a reference strain of L1 virus was isolated from the brain and cervical cord of a 3 y.0. draft mare. Serum samples obtained from 3 of the horses contained HI, CF, pre- cipitating and neutralising antibodies to LI virus, with a rise in antibody titre being demonstrated in 2 animals.

The authors describe their search for a method to reliably record cardiac responses to exercise based on electrocardiographic techniques. Initially the question of electrode placement and design led to the development of silver electrodes suspended in perspex annuli attached to the forehead and loins using a proprietary adhesive. Several systems for recording cardiac electrical activity were tested. A heart rate meter proved inadequate through poor definition of QRS complexes and doubling whenever the T wave was large. Traditional radio-telemetry using standard equipment was unreliable owing to unexpected artifacts such as shadowing of the transmitter by the rider and interference from the rider’s walkie-talkie recording system. The system finally adopted employed a stereo cassette tape recorder tied to the rider’s back in which a dual channel pulse with modulation technique was used, thus enabling effective filtering of mechanical vibration artifacts upon demodulation of the signal.

J . B. DIXON WOOLCOCK, J. B. (1975). This paper describes investigation of the immunity produced in horses to challenge by Streptococcus rqui and a commercial Str. equi vaccine commonly used in Australia. Immunity was assayed by an in vitro bactericidal test, using the production of bactericidal (opsonic) antibodies against cell wall (M) antigens and a test which measured the ability of the test serum to elicit a long chain formation response. These tests are used in correlation to measure immunity to type A Streptococcal infection in man and expert opinion suggests that the tests are applicable to Str. equi and are highly type specific. Opinion also suggests that there is a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunity using these two tests. Results confirmed the recommendation of the vaccine producers that the three dose primary vaccination regime was necessary to give good initial protection in all horses vaccinated. Occasionally however, for reasons not discussed, individual horses did not respond satisfactorily to vaccination. The duration of immunity following vaccination also was variable and some horses had low titres by 3 months post vaccination. The author recommends a booster vaccination at 12 months and found a good anamnestic response at that time. Some horses with high pre-vaccinia1 titres showed intense pain and stiffness following vaccination. Natural infection produced antibody titres which had fallen to low levels by 9 weeks in most horses. This suggested that natural immunity was short lived and reinfection can occur at intervals as short as 6 months. However, even with low titres, further challenge produced a good anamnestic response and this may account for the protection often seen in the field in older horses. Natural immunity relies upon repeated challenge either by natural or artificial challenge. Without this, horses of any age are susceptible to infection. The carrier state, when it occurs, may serve as a natural method of specific immunisation. Results from horses with respiratory infection caused by atypical Str. equi suggested that immunity was highly type specific. It would be interesting to know the effect of vaccination in clinical situations of atypical Str. equi infection. In the rzviewers experience, “typical” clinical cases are frequently assorted with “atypical” bacteriological findings and vice versa. One imagines that vaccination under these circumstances would not always give the desired clinical protection. .4us. Vet. J . 51, 554-559.

CALISHER Vector-Borne Diseases Division, Bureau of Laboratories, Centers for Disease Control, Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Post Office Box 2087, Fort Collins, Colorado 80522 Abstract. In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, fÃ¨ces,etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity ti- trations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary PÃ©kinduck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutrali zation tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey menin- goencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five anti genic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, TamaÃ±abat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro. Although 44 of the registered flaviviruses have been isolated principally or exclusively from mos quitoes or ticks, the remaining 17 have never been recovered from wild-caught arthropods.1 These 17 flaviviruses, isolated primarily from bats and ro dents, may be true arboviruses, transmitted in as yet undefined vectors. Alternatively, they may have maintained a primitive mode of direct trans fer using saliva,2""4 aerosols,5 milk,6 urine7""9 or transplacental transmission. These flaviviruses may represent 1) descendents of ancestral viruses which have not adapted to replication in inver tebrates or 2) viruses which have evolved to an existence now independent of a vector interme diate.4- 10 The flaviviruses under consideration are dis- Accepted 5 March 1982. * This investigation was supported by National Sci ence Foundation grant SPI 78-19169.

Nearly half of the agents have been isolated from the salivary glands of bats. These include Aroa (N. Karabatsos, personal communication, 1980), Batu Cave,1 Carey Island,1 Dakar bat,14 Entebbe bat,15 Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis (MML),16 Phnom Penh bat,17 Rio Bravo,1 Soku luk,18 and TamaÃ±abat3 viruses. Previous studies comparing limited numbers of these viruses1 have described virulence in a vari ety of hosts and demonstrated antigenic related- ness by hemagglutination-inhibition, comple ment-fixation (CF), or neutralization (N) tests. We present the results of virulence studies and sero logie determinations designed to examine the rec ognized flaviviruses with no known vector asso ciations. In addition to the registered prototypes, we also included in this comparison Bukalasa bat18 1273 1274 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER virus, which has yet to be registered, a recently isolated flavivirus from a Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse), and two flaviviruses from Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat) captured in two areas of south Texas. A number of strains of St. Louis encephalitis virusâ€”a proven arbovirusâ€” were also included as controls. An attempt was made to correlate antigenic relationships with geo graphic distribution and potential for arthropod transmission. In this paper, we shall use the term ""flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status"" (FUAS) when referring to those viruses already described. We recognize that some FUAS, e.g., Koutango and Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, may eventually be shown to be transmitted by arthropod vectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Viruses and virus titrations Known histories of the viruses used in these studies are presented in Table 1. Stock virus was prepared as clarified 10% or 20% suspensions of suckling mouse (SM) brain in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.3) containing 4% bovine albumin. Virus seeds were titrated in 2- to 4-day-old SM and endpoints calculated by the method of Reed and Muench.19 Plaque formation was determined in primary PÃ©kinduck embryo (DE) and contin uous rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK,) or Afri can green monkey kidney (Vero) cells; titers were recorded as plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of inoculum. For production of immune ascitic fluids, adult mice were given four immunizing doses in com plete Freund's adjuvant, as described by Tika- singh et al.2"" Inoculation of mosquito cell cultures In order to provisionally assess the potential of these FUAS for replication in mosquitoes, an in vitro system was used. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells21were inoculated with an approximate 1,000 PFU of each of 20 FUAS. St. Louis encephalitis virus, strain TBH-28, a known mosquito-borne virus, and Colorado tick fever virus, strain Florio, a known tick-borne virus, were included as ""pos itive"" and ""negative"" controls, respectively. C6/36 cells were collected in their own supernatant fluids when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed or on day 10, when uninoculated control C6/36 cell cultures began to spontaneously degenerate. Har vests were then titrated in LLC-MK> or Vero cells, whichever cell line had given the highest titers in previous tests. Complement-fixation, hemagglutination, and neutralization tests Antigens for complement-fixation (CF) and hemagglutination (HA) tests were prepared from infected SM brains by sucrose-acetone extrac tion.22 Infectious and beta propiolactone inacti vated antigens were used in a microtiter adapta tion of the LBCF5n test;23 antigens prepared by these methods possess similar breadths of reactiv ity. Serum dilution plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed as previously described.24 Virus-serum mixtures were incubated for approx imately 18 hours at 4Â°Cbefore inoculation of cell monolayers. All except SLE virus-infected cul tures received double agar overlays, with 1:25,000 neutral red in the second overlay. RESULTS Biologic properties Titers of FUAS in mice and cell cultures are shown in Table 2. Titers in SM were from 168'9 to IO1""-1icLD5l(/ml.Average survival times ranged from 4-10 days. Aroa, Entebbe bat, Israel turkey meningoen cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya, and Sokuluk vi ruses produced distinct plaques in Vero cells; Apoi, Batu Cave, Bukalasa bat, Carey Island, Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Montana Myotis leucoencephali- tis, Negishi, Phnom Penh bat, Rio Bravo, and TamaÃ±abat viruses produced indistinct plaques, and the remainder failed to plaque in these cells. All but Entebbe bat and Saboya viruses produced distinct plaques in LLC-MK2 cells; titers ranged from IO44to 10""M PFU/ml. Israel turkey menin goencephalitis and Koutango viruses produced clear plaques in primary DE cells.

Â§(Provisional name of unregistered virus.) virus were selected from a variety of SLE virus isolates of mammalian and mosquito origin and from various locations and collection dates. These were tested in order to select what might be con sidered representative biological variants, based upon unusually low or high titers in SM or DE cells or unusual plaque morphology or delayed ap pearance of plaques in DE cells. Since some of these strains were from rodents it was thought not unlikely that one or more of these strains might have characteristics more similar to FUAS than to prototype SLE virus. However, titers in SM ranged from IO7-2to IO10""3icLD5(l/mland average survival times from 4-7 days. All 12isolates formed plaques in DE cells with titers from IO6-""to IO9-2 PFU/ml; plaques were of uniform morphology and apparent by the 3rd day after inoculation. There fore, only four (Table 1) of the 12 strains were used in further comparisons. Replication in mosquito cell cultures As summarized in Table 3, C6/36 cells showed CPE 9 days after inoculation with SLE virus, a known mosquito-borne flavivirus, and with Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango and Sa boya viruses, 5, 9, and 9 days after inoculation, respectively. Since virus replication could occur without CPE, C6/36 cell harvests were titrated in a sensitive indicator cell culture (LLC-MK, or Vero cells) by plaque assay. All four viruses which caused CPE in C6/36 cells titered IO5Â°PFU/ml or greater. In addition, Aroa, Entebbe bat and Sok uluk viruses replicated to low levels (IO2-7'3-0PFU/ ml) in the mosquito cell line. Hemagglutinin activity Antigens for all but two viruses (Carey Island and TamaÃ±abat) were shown to possess hemag- glutinin activity. The pH optima ranged from 5.9 to 6.8; most optima were below pH 6.5. Excep tions were Aroa (pH 6.7), Koutango (pH 6.6), Sa boya (pH 6.8), and Sokuluk (pH 6.8) viruses. Hemagglutinin activity optima for two of the four SLE virus strains used in these studies had pH optima 6.6 (BeAn 246262 (pH 6.5) and CorAn 9124 (pH 6.3)).

Complement fixation tests Table 4 summarizes the results of cross CF tests. Nearest antigenic neighbors are presented contig uously. When heterologous antibody titer differed more than fourfold from the homologous titer of the virus with which it was compared, it was con sidered a significant difference. Complement-fixation test results may be sum marized as follows: 1. Despite the high potency of immune fluids to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Aroa, Carey Island, and Koutango viruses, significant relationships with other FUAS were not observed. 2. Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus was reactive one-way with SLE virus strains TBH-28 and 246262. 3. Batu Cave and Phnom Penh bat viruses re acted reciprocally to high titer, and could not be distinguished from one another. 4. Antibody to Cowbone Ridge virus, although of low titer, reacted with Sokuluk, SLE strain BeAn 246262, and Sal Vieja* viruses. Jutiapa vi rus was found to be related one-way to San Perlita and MA-387-72 viruses. MA-387-72 and San Per lita* viruses were reciprocally cross-reactive to high titers. 5. Sal Vieja antiserum reacted to high titer with MA-387-72, San Perlita, and Cowbone Ridge vi ruses. 6. Antibody to Rio Bravo virus cross-reacted principally with Apoi and San Perlita antigens. 7. Antibody to Dakar bat virus reacted only with Bukalasa bat and Apoi antigens, and then at a barely detectable level. 8. Antibodies to Bukalasa bat, Montana My otis leucoencephalitis, Negishi, and TamaÃ±abat viruses reacted significantly only with homologous antigens. Negishi antigen, however, titered to within eightfold of homologous antibody to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus. * Mention here of this virus designation is not intend ed to constitute priority. 1278 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER TABLE4 Cross-reactivities of flavivintses with undetermined arthropod-borne status by complement-fixation tests Titer* of antibodytoAntigenApoi Saboya Sokuluk Israel turkey meningoenc.

Antibody to Koutango virus reacted to equal titer with homologous antigen and those of SLE strains CorAn 9124 and SPAn 8678, and antibody to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis reacted sig nificantly with the four strains of SLE virus. Neutralization tests Table S summarizes results of neutralization (N) tests with viruses which were shown to be closely related by CF. The N test results may be sum marized as follows: 1. Antibody to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Aroa, Bukalasa bat, Dakar bat, Entebbe bat, Koutango, Negishi, and Rio Bravo viruses significantly neutralized only homologous virus. Bukalasa bat virus is distinct from the other viruses tested. 2. SLE strain SPAn 8678 reacts in one direction with Aroa virus. 3. The reciprocal neutralization of Batu Cave and Phnom Penh bat viruses indicates that they are strains of the same virus rather than distinct prototypes. 4. Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Modoc, San Per lita and Sal Vieja viruses are interrelated but an- tigenically distinct. San Perlita and strain MA- 387-72 were reciprocally cross-neutralized and ap pear to represent two isolates of a single, newly recognized virus.

The uniform comparisons reported here provide complete relationships between all the viruses tested and allow a precise definition of antigenic relationships, at least insofar as concerns the re agents used. Virulence of these viruses in SM and in LLC-MK.2, Vero and C6/36 cell lines, and in DE cells was determined. Infactivity titers in SM were generally higher than in cell cultures. Pro longed survival of laboratory mice infected with many of these viruses may reflect long-standing adaptations to mammalian hosts. Most of the FUAS produced distinct plaques in LLC-MK2 cells, with the exception of Entebbe bat (in con trast to earlier reports25) and Saboya viruses. Our finding that LLC-MK, cells, in general, are su perior for the replication of these agents confirms previous observations.25'26 Davis and Hardy were able to plaque Modoc virus in Vero cells,27where as we were not; this observation may reflect a difference between their cells and ours. Israel turkey meningoencephalitis and Koutan- go viruses, as well as 12 strains of SLE virus, formed discrete plaques in DE cells. This may be indicative of adaptation to avian hosts.28 Most of the FUAS failed to produce plaques in DE cells, possibly a reflection of adaptation to mammalian reservoir hosts. Epidemiologie evidence suggests that Israel tur key meningoencephalitis virus is arthropod-borne, since avian outbreaks of encephalitis caused by this virus occur seasonally, coinciding with peak arthropod activity.29 Also, it replicates in Aedes albopictus cells3""and is maintained for as long as 30 days in Ae. aegypti and Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes, although transmission rates vary.12-31 1280 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER TABLES Cross-reactivities of flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status by plaque reduction neutralization tests Antibody tiler to* Virus APOI SAB SOKSLEIT (TBH-28)SLEi Â»(-An246262)SLE(CorAn9124)SLE(SPAn8678)AROABC Apoi 5,120 Saboya Sokuluk Israel turkey meninge.

In addition to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus, Koutango virus replicated in C6/36 cells. Coz et al.28 have documented experimental trans mission of Koutango virus by Ae. aegypti mos quitoes infected by intrathoracic inoculation, ar tificial feeding, and feeding on viremic hosts. Koutango virus has also been shown to be trans- ovarially transmitted by Ae. aegypti.32 If any cor relation exists between replication in C6/36 cells and in mosquitoes, then Israel turkey meningoen cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya and probably Aroa, Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses are arthropod- borne. Replication, with or without CPE in C6/ 36 cells, may be an indication of the potential for replication of viruses in mosquito cells in vivo. Aroa virus was initially isolated from a sentinel hamster and therefore is probably arthropod- transmitted; it is related to Bussuquara virus in CF tests (R. E. Shope, personal communication, 1979) and is neutralized by antibody to Bussu quara strain BeAn 4073 and to SLE strain SPAn 8678 viruses; and replicates in C6/36 cells. The second large cluster of FUAS includes those isolated from rodents and bats and which may be transmitted by direct contact. Transmission stud ies with mosquitoes infected by intrathoracic in oculation, artificial feeding, or feeding on infected hosts have been unproductive for Saboya,28 Dakar bat,28 Modoc,4-6 Rio Bravo,4-'"" Apoi,1 Phnom Penh bat,17 Entebbe and Bukalasa bat33 viruses. In addition, Modoc, Apoi, and Rio Bravo viruses failed to replicate in mosquito cell lines.3 Although as yet undescribed and/or unusual arthropod cycles may exist, they have not been detected in arthro pod field studies.'-3-5-13-1(i Saboya virus, isolated from Tatera kempi (ger- bils) in Senegal, is distantly related to Dakar bat, RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN FLAVIVIRUSES 1281 TABLE5 Continued Antibody titer to* CR JUT (SF) (MA- 387-72) (SV) DB (BB) KOU RB 40 40 320 640 320 40 80 40 80 80 3207,2444081381340160â€”5,120160646316806408010,2405,12040404571,2803,620512_40 â€” 40 40 80 320 4S7 40 320 5,120 40 â€” â€” 320 10,240 10,240 40 320 Carey Island, Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses. Antigenic relationships have been shown between Saboya virus and certain mosquito-borne flavivi- ruses of Africa, including Banzi, Bouboui, and Uganda S viruses. ' While attempts to experimen tally infect Ae. aegypti with Saboya virus by in- trathoracic inoculation have failed,28 replication in C6/36 cells (Table 3) may be indirect evidence for replication in arthropods. Apoi virus, isolated only from rodents in Japan, fails to react appreciably with any of the other viruses. Considerable antigenic overlap occurs among the FUAS of North and Central American ro dents, in contrast to the antigenic distance be tween Koutango and Saboya viruses isolated from African rodents. Sal Vieja virus is antigenically unique both by CF and N tests. In fact, based upon CF and N data, an antigenic spectrum ap pears to exist among Cowbone Ridge, Modoc, Sal Vieja, San Perlita, and Jutiapa viruses. Cowbone Ridge has been shown to be related to Modoc virus13 which, in turn, shares antigens with San Perlita prototype (and strain MA-387-72) as well as Jutiapa viruses. Jutiapa, Cowbone Ridge, and San Perlita viruses have been isolated from Sig- modon hispidus in Guatemala, the Florida ever glades, and Texas, respectively. Modoc from the western United States and Canada and Sal Vieja from Texas have been recovered from Peromys- cus species. The antigenic relatedness of Jutiapa to Cow- bone Ridge virus may reflect their evolution in the cricetid rodent host, S. hispidus. A similar asso ciation between the South American cricetid ro dents and at least seven arenaviruses in the Ta- caribe complex relates Zoogeographie distribution of host species to viral phytogeny. Ancestral Cri- 1282 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER cetidae invaded South America from North Amer ica during the Miocene-Pliocene epoch,34 and evolved into a wide variety of forms. Simulta neously, evolution of new arenaviruses occurred. As Arata and Gratz have pointed out,35 the evo lution of S. hispidus as a South American species is certain from the Pleistocene record, and this rodent is therefore a recent invader back into North America. With this migration of S. hispidus, a member of the Tacaribe serogroup (Tamiami vi rus) may have been introduced to Florida. Anal ogous with the arenaviruses, there are bunyavi ruses and FUAS of Florida and Central and South America which have been isolated from neotrop ical cricetid and hystricomorph rodents and mar supials in those places. Thus, Gumbo Limbo (Group C), Shark River and Pahayokee (Patois serogroup), and Mahogany Hammock (Guama serogroup) bunyaviruses and the flavivirus, Cow- bone Ridge, have been isolated in Florida; the Latin American corollaries of these viruses are Nepuyo, Patois and Zegla, CoAn 49888 and Ju- tiapa viruses, respectively. It may be that, as with the arenavirus Tamiami virus, cricetid rodents reinvading North America were infected with vi ruses from South America; or perhaps the viruses had an earlier distribution in Florida but were isolated from the neotropical habitat by geologic changes.36 Antigenically unrelated viruses may utilize sim ilar modes of nonarthropod enzootic dissemina tion. Modoc virus, the most extensively studied of the complex, was first isolated from the mammary gland of Peromyscus maniculatus and has since been shown to localize in mammary' tissue of lac- tating female mice fed on SM infected with the virus."" Modoc virus has been recovered from sal ivary glands, lungs, kidneys, throat swabs and urine of rodents experimentally infected by sub cutaneous or intranasal routes.6""9 Like Modoc, Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Sal Vieja and other FUAS of rodents may also be transmitted inde pendently of arthropod intermediates. Most of the FUAS isolated from bats have been isolated from salivary glands, yet no significant antigenic relationships between these or other fla- viviruses exist. Batu Cave, Phnom Penh bat, and Carey Island viruses have all been isolated from salivary glands of Cynopterus brachyotis (fruit- eating bats) of Southeast Asia.1 Despite this, Ca rey Island virus is more closely related to Dakar bat and Saboya viruses. By contrast, Phnom Penh bat and Batu Cave viruses are cross-reactive in CF and N tests and therefore are strains of the same virus. The nearly simultaneous registration of these viruses precluded recognition of their an tigenic similarity.1'17 Bukalasa bat, Dakar bat, and Entebbe bat vi ruses have been isolated exclusively from salivary glands of African bats.18 In CF tests, antibody to Entebbe bat virus reacts to high titer only with Sokuluk antigen, as reported by Lvov.37 It is in teresting that both Entebbe bat and Sokuluk vi ruses replicate in C6/36 cells. Bukalasa bat and Dakar bat viruses are distinct from one another by both CF and N tests, as ini tially shown by Karabatsos.26 Serosurveys of in sectivorous bat populations demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to Dakar bat, Bukalasa bat, and Entebbe bat viruses.37'38 The tropism of these agents for vertebrate salivary glands, and the failure of investigators to isolate them from arthropods,14'33'38 suggest direct transmission by biting or licking, or by aerosolized droplets. Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis, TamaÃ±abat, and Rio Bravo viruses of the Western Hemisphere are also excreted in saliva of asymptomatic bats. Despite years of field investigations in the enzootic area, Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis virus has not been isolated from mosquitoes or ticks.16 Rio Bravo virus, ubiquitous in dense bat populations roosting in poorly ventilated caves,5 is present in salivary glands, kidneys, and mammary tissues of experimental hosts"" and has produced human in fections, implying direct aerosol transmission.2-5 Attempts to incriminate bat ectoparasites as vec tors were unsuccessful.5 The serologie studies re ported here show these three isolates from insec tivorous bats are minimally cross-reactive and antigenically distinct. By CF, Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis is antigenically remote from oth er viruses tested, confirming previous studies.2"" Only when normal monkey serum was used as diluent did neutralization of Rio Bravo virus by antibody to Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis vi rus occur.2"" In contrast, Bell and Thomas report ed one-way reactions by CF between Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis, Entebbe bat, and SLE (Parton strain) viruses.16 In this study, Rio Bravo and SLE reacted reciprocally to low titer in CF tests, in contrast to the high titer reactions re ported by Sulkin and Allen2 who used guinea pig hyperimmune sera. In summary, the flaviviruses with undeter mined arthropod-borne status may be broadly di vided into two biologic groups; the first repre- RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN FLAVIVIRUSES 1283 sented by Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi, and Aroa viruses. The second includes viruses isolated exclusively from rodents and bats and for which no evidence of vector in termediates has been found; however, Saboya, Sokuluk, and Entebbe bat viruses, replicate in C6/36 cells. The Modoc-Rio Bravo antigenic com plex of Johnson"" is expanded to include, in addi tion to Rio Bravo and Modoc viruses, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, and Apoi viruses. Phnom Penh bat, TamaÃ±abat, and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses appear to be dis tinct; sufficient data are not yet available to place these three viruses into either of the above biologic groupings.

Wang-2009-Japanese encephalitis viruses from b.pdf	Japanese Encephalitis Viruses from Bats in Yunnan, China Jing-Lin Wang,1 Xiao-Ling Pan,1 Hai-Lin Zhang, Shi-Hong Fu, Huan-Yu Wang, Qing Tang, Lin-Fa Wang, and Guo-Dong Liang Genome sequencing and virulence studies of 2 Jap- anese encephalitis viruses (JEVs) from bats in Yunnan, China, showed a close relationship with JEVs isolated from mosquitoes and humans in the same region over 2 decades. These results indicate that bats may play a role in human Japanese encephalitis outbreaks in this region. Bats have been increasingly recognized as an important source of zoonotic viruses responsible for some of the recent major disease outbreaks, including Hendra, Nipah, severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated, and Ebola viruses (1). Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mem- ber of the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus (2) and is the etiologic agent of severe encephalitic diseases in humans. In addition to humans, JEV has been isolated from various hosts, e.g., mosquitoes, birds, pigs, and horses (3,4). The role of bats in JEV epidemiology has been poor- ly defined, although the virus has been isolated from bats of various species since 1963 in multiple locations (5,6). To date, no nucleotide sequence information has been avail- able for bat JEV isolates. Yunnan Province, in southern China, has a tropical to subtropical climate and a diverse biota. The annual case rate of Japanese encephalitis in Yunnan is >2× the aver- age case rate of the whole country (7). We report the mo- lecular and virulence characterization of 2 bat JEV isolates from Yunnan: B58, obtained from a Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia), a fruit bat, in 1989; and GB30, obtained from a little tube-nosed bat (Murina aurata), an insectivore, in 1997. The Study The viruses used in this study were isolated from ho- mogenates of the brains of bats by direct intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of 3-day-old suckling mice. Although isolate B58 was obtained in 1989, no further identification or characterization was conducted until this study. GB30 was identified as JEV by serologic analysis (8). Inoculation in suckling mice was conducted following procedures ap- proved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China. Mice were observed 2× per day after inoculation, and every 2 hours after the onset of clinical signs. After euthanasia, superna- tant from brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells. After the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), su- pernatant was harvested and passaged 3 more times. Virus stock was prepared from the previous passage and stored at –85oC. Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV strains and of a mos- quito-derived JEV strain, M10 (9), were determined. All viruses were consecutively passed 3 times in mice, and virus suspension (defined as the 10–1 stock) was prepared from the third passage. For determination of a 50% lethal dose (LD50), suckling mice (5 per group) were inoculated i.c. with dilutions from 10–1 to 10–9. Animals were moni- tored daily for survival, and the LD50 values were calcu- lated by using a standard method (10). Viral RNA was isolated by using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the Ready-To-Go kit (Amersham Phar- macia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Flavivirus-specific primers (11) and primers designed from the sequence of JEV Beijing-1 (L48916) were used for PCR and sequenc- ing. Sequence assembly was conducted by using the ATGC software package, version 4.0 (GENETYX Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Homology and alignment analysis were con- ducted by using ClustalX version 1.8 (www.clustal.org/ download/1.X/ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX) and MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). MEGA 3.1 (12) was used for phylogenetic analysis. For initial studies, suckling mice were inoculated i.c. with the supernatant of clarified brain homogenate. The 2 groups (n = 8 for each) inoculated with B58 and GB30, re- spectively, displayed clinical signs after 42 h postinocula- tion (hpi), whereas the control group with buffer only (n = 8) displayed no clinical signs. Clinical signs included refus- ing sucking, no interest in grouping, neck rigidity, tremors and muscular spasms, ataxia, and hind-limb paralysis. All mice had to be euthanized from 70 to 78 hpi. The superna- tant of brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells, and CPE was visible at ≈96 hpi for the first passage and at 72 hpi for second and third passages.

Wang) DOI: 10.3201/eid1506.081525 The identity of B58 as JEV was confirmed by PCR sequencing. The complete genome sequence of both iso- lates was then determined. The 2 genomes have identical size at 10,977 nt with a 95-nt 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) and a 583-nt 3′ NTR. The single open reading frame codes for a polyprotein of 3,432 aa. The genomes have similar guanine-cytosine content (51.44% for B58 and 51.39% for GB30). The 2 bat JEV isolates have an overall sequence iden- tity of 99.9% both at nt and aa levels. When compared to 55 known JEV isolates of known complete genome sequenc- es, the nt sequence identity varies from 88.6% to 99.3%, and aa sequence identity from 97.0% to 99.3%. Analysis of the NTR sequences showed that the bat JEV isolates have the same 5′ NTR as do the others, but the 3′ NTRs of the bat JEVs have a G insertion at nt 307, the same as that observed in the Nakayama strain (GenBank accession no. EF571853). Phylogenetic trees derived from nucleotide sequences of the complete genome or the most variable envelope pro- tein gene of selected JEV strains (Table 1) indicated that both JEV isolates from bats are members of genotype III as defined by Solomon et al. (3). A more detailed analysis in- dicated that the bat JEVs are most closely related to human isolate LiYujie and mosquito isolate BN19 within cluster 6 (Figure). Similar phylogenetic trees were obtained based on other gene sequences, such as PrM (data not shown). Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV isolates was deter- mined as described above, and the LD50 for suckling mice was 8.0 log10/0.02 mL, compared with 3.5 log10/0.02 mL for the mosquito strain M10. Neurovirulence of these 2 bat isolates also was predicted from aa sequence comparison to those known to have high neurovirulence (13,14). As shown in Table 2, all residues important for virulence and neurotropism were conserved between the bat JEV isolates and the Nakayama strain. Conclusions In this study, we analyzed the complete genome se- quences of 2 bat JEV isolates. Although previous serologic studies (15) have indicated the occurrence of JEV in a Le- schenault’s rousette, we demonstrate JEV infection of Ma- rina aurata bats, confirming that the same JEV genotype can infect bats of many species. Both bats are commonly present DISPATCHES 940 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 6, June 2009 Table 1.

NA, information not available. JEV from Bats, China in Yunnan Province and other parts of China. The bats tend to roost in trees, caves, and roofs of residential properties in close proximity to rice paddocks and pig pens, provid- ing ample opportunity for cross-species transmission among bats and between bats and other animals. Notably, the 2 JEV strains most closely related to the bat viruses were all iso- lated from Yunnan Province, LiYujie from a human in 1979 and BN19 from mosquitoes in 1982 (Figure). Our study indicates that the same virus is circulating in hosts of at least 4 different species (human, mosquito, and 2 different bat species), and likely in birds as well, highlight- ing the broad host range of JEVs in this area. We empha- size that the 4 closely related strains (B58, GB30, LiYujie, and BN19) were isolated over 2 decades, which suggests that the virus was stably maintained in the region, perhaps by circulating in disparate hosts. The findings from our cur- rent study highlight the potential importance of bats in hu- man JE outbreaks in the region. Needed additional studies of JEV in bats should include the determination of viremia in bats of different species and potential seasonal variation of viral loads among different bats at different geographic locations. This data would provide a better assessment of risks posed by JEV in bats.

This virus replicated in embryonated chicken eggs and caused embryo death. In cross-neutralization tests, antiserum to the partial E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010, whereas antiserum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not. FX2010 is an enveloped RNA virus of approximately 45– 50 nm in diameter. Sequence analysis of its E and NS5 genes showed that both genes share up to 99.6% nucleotide sequence identity with Baiyangdian virus, and up to 88% nucleotide sequence identity with their counterparts in Tembusu virus. FX2010was transmitted without mosquito, and caused systemic infection and lesions in experimentally infected ducks. These results indicate that FX2010 and BYD virus are newly emerged Tembusu virus strains that cause an infectious disease in ducks.

Introduction In April 2010, an outbreak of shelduck infectious disease, of unknown origin, caused death, retarded growth, high fever, loss of appetite, and egg production decline. The outbreak was first detected in Shanghai, China, but spread rapidly to all of the south–east provinces of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Anhui. The disease continued to transmit until winter, and the shelducks in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were under a huge threat by this unknown pathogen. Epizootic investigation suggested that most susceptible animals to this pathogen were shelducks, since infection of muscovy ducks and chickens was not reported. The infection rate andmorbidity of shelducks was as high as 100% and mortality varied from 5% to 30% possibly due to secondary bacterial infections. Postmortem examinations were performed and revealed grossly swollen spleens and kidneys. To date, more than 10 million shelducks have been infected and approximately one mil- lion have died. We isolated a causative agent from sick shelducks by inoculating filtered spleen homogenates into the allantoic sacs of embryonated chicken eggs. Here, we describe the properties of the causative agent of this outbreak. Results Isolation of the causative agent in SPF embryonated chicken eggs Since various antibiotics were used to mitigate the outbreak in ducks without any success, the pathogenwas thought to be a virus. To isolate the causative agent, a homogenate of the spleens of sick shelducks was filtered through 0.22 um filters and inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. All of the embryos of the inoculated eggs died 2–6 days post-inoculation and were severely swollen with edema (Fig. 1). The supernatant of the homogenate of the embryos had an infectivity titer of 105.5 ELD50/mL. Electron microscopy The purified causative agent was examined by electron microscopy.

Physicochemical properties of the isolate To test whether the virus was covered with an organic solvent- labile lipid envelope, FX2010 was treated with either ether or chloroform. FX2010 lost infectivity after treatmentwith either organic solvents, indicating that it is an enveloped virus. To define the nucleic acid type of FX2010, RNA and DNA were extracted from purified FX2010 and subjected to agarose electropho- Nucleotide Substitutions (x100) 32.5 51015202530 Ilheu Rocio virus Fig. 3. Phylogenetic tree for the NS5 gene of the Tembusu virus FX2010. The phylogenetic tree alignment algorithm. The length of the branches represents the distance between sequence resis. No specific DNA band was found on the gel, while a specific RNA band was detected (data not shown). Upon treatment of the nucleic acid extracted from FX2010 with RNase but not DNase, the RNA band was no longer detected. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis An FX2010 cDNA library was made and 100 plasmids extracted from the bacterial clones picked randomly from the cDNA librarywere directly sequenced. One-third of the sequences of the inserted nucleotides shared 40%–80% identity with viruses of the flavivirus family when analyzed by using BLAST at the NCBI. The remaining sequences showed high identity with the rRNAs or mRNAs of Gallus gallus. Sequences with high homology to other virus genera were not found. The complete E gene (1–1497 nucleotides)(GenBank accession number HQ833330)and a partial sequence (1022 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus) of the NS5 gene (GenBank accession number HQ833331) of FX2010 were determined when the library sequences were compiled and analyzed by using the SEQMAN program. To understand the taxonomic relationship of FX2010, the sequences of the E gene, from nucleotide positions 318 to 1266 and the 1022 nucleotide segment of the NS5 gene were compared with those of representative flavivirus obtained from GenBank. The nucleotide sequences of the E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 were highly similar to those of BYD virus (sharing 99.6% and 99.7% nucleotide identities, respectively); BYD virus was isolated from ducks with egg-drop syndrome in China (Su et al.). The E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 88.3% and 88.0% nucleotide homology with those of the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain, respectively. Accordingly, the amino acid sequence of the E protein and the NS5 protein of FX2010 proved to be 97.2% and 98.8% identical to those of the MM1775 strain, respectively. When compared with other viruses in the Nyata group, to which Tembusu virus belongs, of genus Flavivirus, the NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 69.6%, 75.1%, 76%, 71.2%, and 76.8% nucleotide identity with that of Rocio virus, Ntaya virus, Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, Ilheus virus, and Bagaza virus, respectively (Fig. 3). The NS5 protein that corresponded to the 1022 nucleotide sequence from the 3′ terminus of FX2010 shared 78.2%–88.8% amino acid homology with that of these viruses. Since the flavivirus isolates with N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998), we designated this virus Tembusu virus Fengxian 2010 (FX2010) after the name of the virus species, the district from which it came, and the time when it was isolated. 0 Tembusu virus Sitiawan Tembusu virus strain MM1775 Tembusu virus FX2010 Baiyangdian virus Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus Bagaza virus Ntaya virus s virus was constructed by use of theMEGALIGN program (DNASTAR) and by using the Clustal pairs.

A protein expression plasmid, pCAGGS-E possessing this partial E gene under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter, was generated. BALB/c mice were injected intramuscularly with this protein expression plasmid every two weeks. Three weeks after the third injection, the serum of the immunized mice was collected for cross- neutralization assays. 3P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Cross-neutralization assays In cross serum neutralization tests between FX2010 and JEV, we found weak to no cross-reactivity with heterologous antibodies; an antiserum against FX2010 neutralized its homologous virus at a serum dilution of 1:1580 (Table 1). In cross serum neutralizing tests between FX2010 and Tembusu virus, an antiserum against the partial E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010 at a serum dilution of 1:90.

The infectivity titers were 105.5 ELD50/mL and 104.5 ELD50/mL in duck embryo fibroblasts and VERO cells, respectively. Upon three further passages of the virus in duck embryo fibroblasts, CPEs became apparent. Pathogenicity in ducks Birds were thought to be the natural hosts of flaviviruses, and only a limited number of flaviviruses were reported previously to cause disease or death in ducks. We, therefore, infected six shelducks by inoculating them i.n. or i.m. with 0.2 mL of supernatant of homoge- nates of embryos containing 105 ELD50 of FX2010. One day after the ducks were inoculated, we introduced three naïve ducks to the isolator in which the i.n.-infected ducks were housed. Both the i.n. and i.m. inoculated ducks lost their appetite on day 3 post-infection, and the contact ducks showed symptoms similar to those of the infected animals on day 5 post-contact. Upon dissection of the inoculated ducks on day 4 post-infection and of the contact ducks on day 6 post- exposure to the infected ducks, all of the ducks showed grossly swollen spleens and kidneys.

Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Histopathological studies showed that all of the ducks tested had systemic lesions: moderate necrosis in the brain, severe nephrosis, pneumorrhagia, and severe necrosis of the spleen. To detect the specific viral antigen of FX2010 in organs, tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with an antiserum against FX2010. Virus antigens were found in the brain, kidney, lung, and spleen (Fig. 4), indicating systemic infection of FX2010; no antigen was detected in the tissues of uninfected ducks. Upon viral titration in organs, high levels of virus were detected in the trachea, spleen, pancreas, kidney, brain, lung, livers, and blood of the inoculated and contact ducks (Table 2). The results show that the virus could transmit efficiently and directly to contact animals without mosquito. To determine the mortality rate in a larger cohort of ducks, a total of eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with 105 ELD50 of FX2010 in 0.2 mL. Of these, three ducks died on day 7, day 10, and day 11 post-infection, yielding a mortality rate of 7.5%. None of the forty ducks in the negative control group died during the experiment. All of the remaining ducks that were inoculated with FX2010 seroconverted. Discussion Tembusu virus (TMUV), a member of the Ntaya virus (NTAV) group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, has been frequently isolated from Culex and Aedes mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand (Gubler et al., 2007). Although birds, including domestic fowl, are thought to be the natural vertebrate hosts of Flavivirus (Hoshino et al., 2009; Lindh et al., 2008), a few infectious diseases of poultry caused by these viruses have been recorded (Ianconescu et al., 1975). Sitiawan virus, which was isolated from sick chicken and transmitted by Culex mosquitoes in Malaysia was one of the first Tembusu virus strains reported to cause disease in domestic poultry (Kono et al., 2000). Recently, Su et al. (2011) reported that a new Tembusu-related flavivirus, BYD virus, caused duck egg-drop syn- drome in China. The E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 have 99.6% and 99.7% nucleotide identities with those of BYD virus, respectively, suggesting that the FX2010 and BYD viruses are essentially the same virus. The E and NS5 genes of the FX2010 and BYD viruses share about 88% nucleotide homology and 97% amino acid homologywith those of Tembusu virus. Cross-neutralization studies with the reference Tembusu virus would further support an antigenic relationship between FX2010 and other Tembusu viruses. However, we could not obtain a permit from the Chinese government to import the reference Tembusu virus, because it does not exist in China. However, we found that the antiserum to the partial E protein (aa 107-422) of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010, whereas antise- rum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not. These results suggest a close antigenic relationship between FX2010 and Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain. Recently, classification of adenoviruses based on C C1 C2 Fig. 4 (continued). 5P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 sequences, not serology, was suggested and debated widely (Aoki et al., 2011; Imperiale and Enquist, 2011; Seto et al., 2011). For flavivirus, isolateswith N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998). Therefore, FX2010 and BYD virus represent a new strain of Tembusu virus because the former viruses share about 88.0% nucleotide homology for the NS gene with the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain. Although BYD virus was described as a new Tembusu-related flavivirus (Su et al.), we suggest that the virus be named as a Tembusu virus. A Tembusu virus has never before been detected in China. Given the limited sequence information available, it is not possible for us to speculate which of the amino acid differences may contribute to the different pathogenic properties of these viruses in ducks. Only a limited number of flaviviruses have been reported to cause duck infectious diseases (Wojnarowicz et al., 2007), although many flaviviruses, whose pathogenicity for animals is unknown, have been isolated from mosquitoes, ticks, and bats (Cook et al., 2009; Crabtree et al., 2009; Ebel, 2009; Epstein et al., 2010; Hoshino et al., 2009; Huhtamo et al., 2009; Junglen et al., 2009; Morales-Betoulle et al., 2008; Platt et al., 1975; Roiz et al., 2009; Saiyasombat et al., 2010). Tembusu virus was isolated frommosquitoes in Kuala Lumpur in 1955 (Kono et al., 2000). Since then, Tembusu virus has been isolated from the Culex species of mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand. Encephalitis and retarded growth of chicks caused by a Tembusu virus was firstly reported in Malaysia (Kono et al., 2000). In addition, high levels of serum-neutralizing antibody against Tembusu virus have been reported in humans in Malaysia, although a disease associated with Tembusu virus infection had not yet been reported (Kono et al., 2000). It remains unknown whether FX2010-like Tembusu virus can infect humans, although the virus has spread widely in Southeast China. However, given that the areas where FX2010-like Tembusu virus is circulating are among the most densely populated areas in the world, this virus may pose a threat to human health in the future. We recommend that human serological surveillance be conducted in FX2010-likeTembusu virus -circulating areas as soon as possible. Materials and methods Field samples In a shelduck layer farm in the Fengxian district of Shanghai, China, an outbreak of a disease characterized by retarded growth, egg production decline, and 10% mortality was observed in 9–26-week- old ducks. Postmortem examinations were performed on the dead ducks. Tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin; 3-um sections were stain with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic diagnosis. Virus isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs The homogenated spleens of dead shelducks were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), filtered through 0.22 um filters and inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (0.1 mL per egg). Embryos and the chorio- allantoic membranes of the eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation were pooled, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use for virologic and molecular analyses. Virus purification The above-described supernatant of homogenated embryos and chorio-allantoicmembraneswas subjected toultra-speed centrifugation; D D1 D2 Fig. 4 (continued). 6 P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 the pellet was resuspended in PBS, loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient of 30%, 45%, and 60% (W/V), and centrifuged for 2 h at 35,000 rpm. The fraction between the 30% and 45% sucrose gradient was collected and ultra-centrifuged; the pellet was resuspended in PBS. Electron microscopy Purified virus was negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid and observed under a JEM2100 transmission electron microscope. Table 2 Replication of FX2010 in ducks.

The organic layers were discarded, and air was bubbled through both mixtures for 2 min to remove residual organic solvents.

Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8 Nucleic acid extraction and identification Nucleic acid was extracted from purified virus by using the QIAamp Viral RNAMini Kit (QIAGEN Inc. Valencia, CA, US) or the Viral DNA Extraction Kit (ABigen Inc, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the nucleic acid type, extracted nucleic acid was treated with RNase and DNase (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Construction of a cDNA library of viral genes Viral cDNAs were synthesized by using a cDNA Library Construc- tion Kit (Takara), which includes the following steps: first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA synthesis, adaptor ligation, restriction enzyme treatment, vector ligation, and competent Jm109 cell transformation. Bacterial clones were picked at random for sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Plasmids extracted from the bacterial clones picked from the cDNA library were directly sequenced by use of the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Foster, CA, USA) and an ABI 3500 genetic analyzer. To compile and analyze the sequences, we used the SEQMAN program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The sequences of the reference viruses were obtained from GenBank by using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Informa- tion (NCBI) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The nucleotide sequences were compared and phylogenetic trees were generated with the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR) by using the Clustal alignment algorithm. The sequences of the following reference viruses were included in the phylogenetic analysis: Baiyangdian (BYD) virus, JF312912; Tembusu virus strain MM1775, AF013408.1; Tembusu virus Sitiawan, AB110489.1; Rocio virus, AF013397.1; Ntaya virus, AF013392. 1; Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, AF013377.1; Ilheus virus, AF013376.1; and Bagaza virus, AF013363.1. Cross-neutralization assays Antisera against the FX2010 virus were collected from ducks 21 days after i.m. inoculation with 105 ELD50 of FX2010. The antiserum to JEV was from a pig infected with JEV, strain SA-1414-2 (provided by Shanghai Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shang- hai, PRC). Because Tembusu virus and antiserum to it were not available in our laboratory, a portion of the E gene encoding amino acids 107 to 422 with artificial start and stop codons was synthesized based on the sequence in GenBank (AB110494.1). A protein expression plasmid, pCAGGS-E, possessing this partial E gene under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter was generated. BALB/c mice were injected i.m. with this protein expression plasmid every two weeks. Three weeks after the third injection, the serum of the immunized mice was collected for cross-neutralization assays. The viruses used in the cross-neutralization assays were FX2010 (second passage in embryonated chicken eggs) and JEV (provided by Shanghai Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shanghai, PRC). Serial ten-fold dilutions starting from a 1:5 dilution of the heat-inactivated antisera were mixed with 100 TCID50 of JEV or 100 ELD50 of FX2010 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture containing JEV was then inoculated into BHK cells, and the mixture containing FX2010 was inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For the neutralization assays with JEV, the results were read when cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in control cultures (no antiserum) and the serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited CPEs. For the neutralization assays with FX2010, the serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited egg embryo death 6 days post-inoculation. Virus replication in cell cultures African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and duck embryo fibroblast cultures were used for virus replication. These cells were grown in 75 mm flasks and then infected with 100 ELD50 of FX2010 in 1 mL of PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions of viral samples (0.1 mL) were inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Three eggs were used for each dilution. The eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation were considered virus-positive; the 50% egg lethal dose (ELD50) was calculated by using Reed and Muench's method. To detect CPEs, FX2010 was passaged five times in duck embryo fibroblasts. Duck experiments To determine the pathogenicity of the virus isolate, six 9-week-old ducks (a local outbred strain of shelducks) were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 50% lethal doses for eggs (ELD50) of virus in 0.2 mL of supernatant of homogenized embryos and chorio-allantoic membranes of eggs that died 24–120 h post-inocula- tion with FX2010 and housed separately in two isolators. One day after inoculation, to test the transmissibility of the virus, three contact ducks were introduced into the isolator in which the ducks that had been inoculated i.n. were housed. Three virus-inoculated ducks in each group and three uninfected control ducks were euthanized on day 4. Six days after being co-housedwith the virus-inoculated ducks, the three contact ducks were euthanized. Samples of lung, trachea, kidney, brain, liver, pancreas, spleen, and blood were collected and virus titers were determined by using 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For histopathological study, samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Alternatively, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted with an antiserumagainst the virus isolate. The three remainingducks thatwere inoculated i.n. or i.mwere observed daily for 10 days for signs of disease. To determine the mortality rate of ducks infected with FX2010, eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with 0.2 mL of 105 ELD50 of FX2010 virus, and another forty ducks were inoculated i.n. with the same volume of PBS. The two groups of ducks were housed separately in different rooms and were observed daily for 20 days for signs of disease, and the number of duck deaths was recorded. Acknowledgments We thank Drs.
