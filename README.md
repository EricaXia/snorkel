# Extracting Virus-Host relations from Academic Papers - Machine Learning Project Using Snorkel

In this project, we build a Snorkel application to extract and identify correct mentions of virus and animal host species from academic research papers. The tasks are broken up into each step of the pipeline. 

1. **Document Preparation, Preprocessing, and Candidate Extraction**
