      "ISOLATION OF VIRUSES FROM WILD MAMMALS IN WEST AFRICA, 1966-1970 Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 27’? ISOLATION OF VIRUSES FROM WILD MAMMALS IN WEST AFRICA, 1966-1970 GRAHAM E. KEMP*, OTTIS R. CAUSEY*, HENRY W. SETZERt, and DOROTHY 1. MOORE* Abstract: During the S-year period 1966-1970, a total of 7497 wild mammals of at least 101 different species were collected from 36 locations in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo and sampled for virus. The collections were made in five ecologically distinct vegetative zones: high forest, Guinea, Sudan, and Sahel woodland, and the J05 Plateau. Sixteen different virus types, represented by 83 isolates, were recovered, as follows: Arumowot (6 isolates), Bhanja (2), bluetongue type 7 (1), Chandipura (1), Congo (2), Dakar bat (3), Dugbe (1), IbAn 17143 (1), IbAn 33709 (1), Lebombo (1), Mokola (4), poxvirus IbAn 34325 (1), Semliki Forest (1), SudAn 754/6 1 (53), Uganda 5 (3), and West Nile (2). Viruses were isolated from Nigeria, the principal area of mammal collecting, and Dahomey, but not from Togo. The possible relationship of these viruses to diseases of man and domestic animals is discussed. Over the past 10 years, the Virus Re- search Laboratory (VRL) at the Univer- sity of Ibadan has examined materials from a variety of sources for the presence of arboviruses. Isolations have been at- tempted from man, domestic and wild animals, reptiles, and arthropods, as well as from sentinel mammals and birds.6’#{176} This report deals with a single aspect of the surveillance, namely, the virologic investigation of wild mammals collected in the environs of Ibadan and on numer- ous field trips in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo during the period 1966-1970. Many of these collections were made conjointly with personnel of the Smithsonian Institu- tion, Division of Mammals, who were then engaged in a Pan-African mammal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection and Identification of Animals Cooperative studies between the VRL and the Smithsonian Institution were carried out in Nigeria in 1966 and 1967, and in Dahomey and Togo in 1968. Since the primary objective of the Smith- sonian team was to collect mammals from a variety of habitats for correla- tion of taxonomic and ecologic data, most of the animals they captured were prepared as permanent museum speci- mens and later definitively identified in Washington, D.C. These animals were routinely made available for virologic assay, but not all were actually sampled. Conversely, not all the animals collected by the VRL were prepared as museum specimens; indeed, as VRL staff gained proficiency in identification, it was neces- sary only occasionally to send museum specimens to the Smithsonian for verifi- cation of species. During 1967, responsibility for mam- mal trapping in the vicinity of Ibadan was gradually assumed by the VRL, and during the years 1968 through 1970 all collecting and processing of animals in Nigeria was done by VRL staff. Collection Sites Collecting was done at 36 sites (see map, Fig. 1). Continuing collections were * Virus Research Laboratory, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.

A detailed listing of the locations is omitted in favor of general information about the vegetative zones in which the sites occur: high forest, Guinea wood- land, Jos Plateau, Sudan woodland, and Sahel woodland. The following account is based on Keay’s” description of Ni- gerian vegetation. The entire region sampled is tropical and experiences high temperatures the year round. As one proceeds from south to north, however, the dry season be- comes progressively longer, so that an- nual rainfall varies overall from 355 cm in portions of the high forest zone to as low as 25 cm in the Sahel woodland zone. The vegetation varies accordingly. The high forest zone of Nigeria, a belt of dense rain forest with tall trees form- ing a canopy, has suffered vast patchy destruction owing to heavy human popu- lation pressure, and much of it now qualifies as “derived savannah.” This is particularly true of the area surrounding Ibadan, which city is located near the northern limit of the forest zone and has an annual rainfall of about 122 cm. The Guinea woodland zone, next to the north, typically consists of rather open woodland, with smaller trees (about 12 m) and tall bunchy grass. The dry season here lasts an average of S months; FIGURE 1. Map showing locations in West Africa where wild mammals were collected, 1966- 1970. [Map adapted from D. R. Rosevear. 1965. The Bats of West Africa. British Museum (Nat. Hist.).] Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 281 annual rainfall varies from 122 to 102 cm, south to north; and the lowest mean relative humidity is 28%. The Jos Plateau, although located in the northern Guinea zone, is considered separately because of its very different altitude-about 1280 m above sea level. As a result of widespread degradation by man, the plateau today consists of wide grassy plains dotted with rocky hills that may or may not be wooded. In recent years, rainfall has varied from 122 cm to as high as 172 cm.� Two of the four collecting sites on the plateau were visited twice: Jos town, in 1969 and 1970; and the village of Panyam, in 1967 and 1969. The Sudan woodland zone is clearly differentiated from the Guinea zone: the dry season average 7 months; annual rainfall varies from 84 to 71 cm, south to north; and the lowest mean relative humidity is 23%. In Nigeria, nearly all of the Sudan zone has been inhabited for centuries, with consequent modifi- cation of the vegetation by farming. More of the trees here have thorns than in the Guinea zone, and the grass is shorter and feathery. At Kware, a village 13 miles north of Sokoto, collecting was done in both May and November 1966 and again in 1970. Methods of Collection In the vicinity of Ibadan, ordinarily two collections were made each week. Terrestrial mammals were caught mainly by snap traps, although folding aluminum box traps were also used. Occasionally traps were placed on tree limbs to cap- ture arboreal rodents. Insectivorous bats were caught in mist nets set up in strate- gic positions near the openings from which the animals emerged for evening flights; frugivorous bats were caught in mist nets placed adjacent to fruiting trees or shrubs. On occasion, mist nets were strung in locations that favored the cap- ture of both insectivorous and frugivor- ous species. During field trips, animals were cap- tured or were purchased dead or alive from local residents. Official personnel captured small animals mainly by the use of snap traps, but again some fold- ing aluminum traps were used. Ordin- arily traps were set late in the afternoon and checked early the next morning; however, if ants were found to be at- tacking the trapped animals, checks were also made at intervals during the night. Bats were either caught in mist nets or else were shot, usually during the day as they rested in leafy trees but occasionally when they were on the wing in the early evening. Some night hunting was con- ducted to capture nocturnally active mammals of many different genera. Sampling of Tissues for Virologic Studies Most animals were killed in the process of capture. All, whether dead or alive, were immediately treated with chloro- form to immobilize parasites. Live ani- mals were then killed by exsanguination under anesthesia or, if blood was not taken, by the use of chloroform. After identification, the animal was brushed by hand to loosen ticks, fleas, lice, and mites, which were collected in a white enamel pan. In the case of animals re- quiring more definitive identification, the host was then weighed, measured, and carefully prepared as a museum speci- men, the cleaned skull being preserved separately for later taxonomic studies. All components of a single animal were labeled with the same number. Tissues were then taken from the carcass and the carcass discarded. On field trips, approximately 0.1 g samples of liver and spleen were re- moved and placed together in a vial, which was then kept in a cryogenic ves- sel on liquid nitrogen until returned to the laboratory. For animals captured at Ibadan, the organ pool usually consisted of liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and lung. In the case of bats, salivary glands also were removed, with separate instruments, and placed in a vial by themselves. Brain tissue was seldom taken. Although live animals occasionally were bled for sero- logic testing, blood specimens usually were not examined for virus-the one notable exception being the specimens collected at Bassa in 1970 in connection with Lassa fever investigations.3 282 Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 At the laboratory, vials containing tis- sues were stored at -60C in a mechani- cal refrigerator until processed for virus isolation attempts. Blood samples were kept at ambient temperatures until the clot began to retract; after centrifugation, serum was poured into plastic tubes and stored at -60C. Virologic Techniques All attempts to isolate virus were car- ried out by intracerebral (ic) inoculation of 2- or 3-day-old mice. The methods used in processing of specimens, inocu- lation of mice, passaging of isolates, and characterization of agents have been de- scribed.5#{176} Reisolation was not always at- tempted. Once established by passage in mice, viruses were screened in comple- ment-fixation tests against a battery of reference immune mouse ascitic fluids for agents previously isolated in Ibadan, and immune fluids and antisera from other laboratories. When necessary, iden- tification was confirmed by neutralization test. Agents that remained unidentified were referred to the Yale Arbovirus Re- search Unit, New Haven, Connecticut, for further study. RESULTS During the 5-year period, 7497 wild mammals, collected from each of the major vegetative zones south of the Sahara except the mangrove swamps, were examined for virus (Table 1). These animals comprised at least 101 different species and were collected in all months of the year. The six most frequently taken species, which together made up more than half the total animals sampled, were: multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, 1292; brown grass rat, Arvi- cant/us ni!oticus, 839; shrew, Crocidura complex (perhaps as many as six species), 548; desert gerbil, Tatera kempii, 505; African hedgehog, A te!erix albiventris, 450; and big-toothed mouse, Uranomys ruddi, 441. Sixteen different virus types (83 iso- lates) were recovered from 14 different species of animal (Table 2). Nine virus types were isolated from insectivores, either Atelerix albiventris (6) or Croci- dura sp. (3). Multiple virus types also were isolated from the rodents Tatera kempii (4), Arvicanthzis nilolicus (4), the giant rat, Cricetomys gainbianus (3), and Mastomys nata!ensis (2). SudAn 754/61 virus, the agent most frequently encountered, was recovered 53 times from nine species-one insecti- vore, one primate, and seven rodent. Arumowot virus, second in frequency with six isolates, was recovered from one insectivore and three rodent species. Only one other virus, Bhanja, was re- covered from both an insectivore and a non-insectivore species. Bluetongue type 7, Chandipura, Congo, IbAn 17143, Mo- kola, and Semliki Forest viruses were each exclusive to a single insectivore species. Uganda S virus was isolated from three species, all rodents, and Dugbe, IbAn 33709, Lebombo, poxvirus (IbAn 34325), and West Nile viruses were each exclusive to a single rodent species. Dakar bat virus was obtained only from Tadari- da condy!ura. Table 3 analyzes the distribution of virus isolates by month and in relation to monthly numbers of animals tested. If we assume that the dry season months for the areas sampled are November through March, then in the dry season 10 isolates (8 virus types) were recovered from 3039 animals tested for an isolation rate of 0.3%. If, by corollary, April through October are considered the rainy season months, then in the rainy season 73 isolates (11 types) were obtained from 4458 animals tested for an isolation rate of 1.6%. April and May were the months with the highest isolation percentages, 1.8 and 2.7 respectively. In Table 4, virus isolations are ana- lyzed by vegetative zone and year. The Sudan woodland zone provided the ma- jority of isolates (53) and had the highest isolation rate (2.3%). Both figures re- flect the numerous recoveries of SudAn 754/61 virus, of which 33 were made in 1970 at Kware, during an epizootic caused by this virus in small mammals. Only SudAn 754/61 and Arumowot viruses were encountered in three zones- Guinea woodland, Jos Plateau, and Su- dan woodland.

Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 289 vironment may shed light on the epizoo- tiology and potential importance of the agents to man and animals in West Africa. Dugbe, Congo, and Bhanja viruses are tick-borne agents frequently isolated from ixodid ticks and domestic livestock in Nigeria.7’0”8 Dugbe is the virus most commonly recovered by the VRL in Ni- geria and has also been responsible for febrile illnesses in man.00 The present isolation from the giant rat Cricetomys gambianus represents the first of Dugbe from wildlife. Cricetomys occurs in grea- ter numbers in Nigeria than this study would imply, since local residents prefer to eat these rats instead of contributing them for research. Congo virus, associated with human morbidity in Zaire (the former Belgian Congo) and with both morbidity and mortality in East Africa, has recently been shown to be indistinguishable anti- genically from the causative agent of Crimean hemorrhagic fever of man in the USSR.’ The fact that the first two wildlife isolates of Congo virus in Ni- geria came from the African hedgehog, TABLE 4.

Such a reservoir might well consti- tute a source of virus for migratory birds on their way to Europe or Asia, or for their ectoparasites. If so, gathering places for migratory birds may be important as dissemination and virus amplification sites; for example, Malamfatori on Lake Chad, where several avian species as- semble in vast numbers from a wide area of West Africa before crossing the Sahara on their spring migration. Bhanja virus, originally isolated in India from ticks, Haemaphysalis interme- dia, removed from a paralyzed goat,” has not been implicated in human disease. In Nigeria, this virus has been isolated re- peatedly from both livestock� and ticks.1#{176} The present two isolates, from the Afri- can hedgehog and the ground squirrel, Xerus eryt/uropus, are believed to be the first from wildlife. Chandipura, of the vesicular stomatitis (VS) group of arboviruses, was first iso- lated from man in India during an epi- demic in which both it and the presump- tive causative agent, chikungunya virus, were recovered from seemingly indis- tinguishable illnesses.2 The present isola- tion of Chandipura from a hedgehog rep- resents the first of a VS group virus in Africa and has been reported elsewhere.” This finding of the virus in northern Ni- geria, in an important livestock-rearing area, would seem to have possible disease implications in West Africa for both man and his domestic animals. Lebombo is a serologically ungrouped arbovirus that was originally isolated from mosquitoes, A edes circumluteolus, in South Africa (South African Institute for Medical Research, unpublished data). In addition to its recovery in this study from a cutting grass rat, Thryonomys swinderianus, it has been isolated in Nigeria from lice (Scipio aulacodi) ob- tained from the same rat, from Mansonia at ricana (V.H. Lee, personal communica- tion), and from a febrile child.” has been isolated only in Nigeria: from non-nervous tissues of shrews,n from cerebrospinal fluid of a child who sur- vived the infection,’2 and from the brain of a child who died of a paralytic ill- ness.’8 Epidemiologic data pertaining to these infections” and results of experi- mental transmission studies in shrews” are reported elsewhere. This virus may well be a cause of significant morbidity or mortality in West Africa, where shrews are common in urban and rural habitats. The present recovery of Semliki Forest virus, a group A arbovirus, from a hedge- hog represents the first isolation of this agent both in Nigeria and, to our know- ledge, from a naturally infected mammal. Uganda S virus, of arbovirus group B, has been isolated from mosquitoes and from a febrile child in South Africa.” The present three isolates, each from a different rodent genus, may indicate that small mammals play a role in the main- tenance of the virus in nature. This pos- sibility is supported by recovery of Uganda S virus from sentinel baby mice in the vicinity of Ibadan during 1966 (VRL, unpublished data). West Nile virus, also of group B, is widely distributed, having been isolated in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe.’7”'” In man, infection with the virus may range from inapparent infection to feb- rile illness to a dengue-like illness, with or without rash, to encephalitis.3”25” The virus also has been isolated from wild birds,” a bat,” and two naturally in- fected horses with encephalitis, one in Egypt” and the other in France.’6 In Nigeria, isolations have been made from sentinel mice (1965, 1967, 1969), wild birds (1965, 1968), and camels (1969)19 The recoveries from Arvicanthis niloticus reported here are thought to represent the first from rodents. Bluetongue is an important disease of sheep and cattle in some parts of the world. A number of bluetongue virus strains have been recovered from Cu/i- coides spp. in Nigeria;” these seem to cause little or no observable disease in indigenous sheep,” but exotic animals, if introduced into the country, would prob- ably be at risk. The significance of the isolation of bluetongue virus type 7 from Journal of Wildlife Diseases Vol. 10, July, 1974 291 a shrew is not yet known; however, blue- tongue strains have been isolated from rodents in South Africa.’5 So far there is no evidence to indicate that the remaining six virus types isolated in this study play a role in infections of man or domestic animals. Arumowot and SudAn 754/61 viruses, both members of the Phlebotomus fever group, were first isolated in the Sudan, the former from Culex antennatus in 196382 and the latter from a mixed tissue pool from animals (J. Schmidt, personal communication). Our findings extend their known range from the Sudan in northeast Africa to the savannah areas of West Africa, and one might thus expect these agents to be pre- sent in many of the arid regions of Africa. Neither virus seems to have a pronounced host preference, SudAn 754/61, in particular, having been isola- ted from nine different species of wild mammal in this study. Dakar bat virus is a member of the group B bat salivary gland viruses, which Acknowledgements appear to be host specific and perhaps are able to propagate in their mammal- ian hosts without the need for an arthro- pod vector. Details of the characterization of pox- virus, IbAn 34325, will be reported sep- arately. IbAn 17143 and IbAn 33709 are probably new viruses and are still under study; nothing is yet known concerning their pathogenicity for animals other than mice. It should be noted that most of the iso- lations reported here were made from tis- sue specimens. With the collections at Bassa, however, only serum specimens were tested, and these yielded two isolates of Bhanja virus, and one each of Congo and Dugbe viruses. As already mentioned, the Bhanja and Dugbe isolates represent the first of the two agents from wildlife. Whether more general use of serum, rather than tissues, would have resulted in a greater number of Bhanja and Dugbe isolates is not known. During the period in which these studies were carried out, the Virus Research Laboratory received support from The Rockefeller Foundation. The authors are particularly indebted to the field representatives of the Smithsonian Institu- tion, U.S. National Museum, who made their headquarters at Ibadan. These personnel did a good deal of training of VRL staff in the trapping and identification of animals and the preparation of museum specimens from them for definitive identification in Washington, D.C. In order of their arrival in Ibadan, they were Mr. and Mrs. Harry John Herbert and Mr. and Mrs. Julius Geest. The Smithsonian team in Togo and Dahomey consisted of Mr. Brian Robbins and Mr. James Leduc. All of these field team members deserve special praise in that they performed repetitive, eaacting tasks under difficult living conditions understood only by those who have lived continu- ously in a tent in the humid and arid tropics. Mr. Stanley Akpan assisted in the collection and identification of animals in the Ibadan area and also on trips independent of the Smithsonian teams with VRL staff. Mr. James Phillips col- lected the majority of the primate samples during 1969. Mr. Max.welt Alphonsus assisted in virology, and Mr. Edward O’Connor with identification of viral isolates. Thanks are also due to governmental officials too numerous to mention in Nigeria, Dahomey, and Togo, who greatly facilitated the attempts to collect animals. LITERATURE CITED I. ALTMAN, R. and W.
