Abstract

Introduction: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes one of the most important flavivirus infections of the
central nervous system, affecting humans in Europe and Asia. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected
tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been
based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be
misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation.
Method: To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis
voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)–
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a
rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with
that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas.
Results: In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months
and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk
areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas.
TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus
agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated.
Discussion and Conclusion: The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected
M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study
showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation.

Introduction

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most im-portant flaviviral human diseases in Europe and Asia.
The causative agent TBE virus (TBEV) has a positive single-
stranded RNA genome of about 11 kilobases and is a member

of the tick-borne flavivirus group (genus Flavivirus, family
Flaviviridae) (Grard et al. 2007, Mansfield et al. 2009).

TBEV is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick or, rarely,
through nonpasteurized milk products from infected mam-
mals (Holzmann et al. 2009). The main vectors of TBEV are
ticks of the genus Ixodes: Ixodes persulcatus in Asia and eastern

Europe and Ixodes ricinus in central, eastern, and western
Europe. During the lifecycle of a tick, TBEV can be transmitted
transstadially, transovarially, or primarily from infected ticks
to other ticks while cofeeding on the same rodent host (Pfeffer
and Dobler 2010).

The virus circulates between vector ticks and some of their
hosts, mostly deer and small mammals such as rodents and
insectivores, whereas only small mammals are presumed to be
competent virus reservoir hosts (Mansfield et al. 2009). Larger
mammals, such as sheep, cattle, or humans, are accidental hosts,
as they develop only a short viremia with low viral titers or no
detectable viremia. As a consequence, they are not competent to
transmit and spread the virus (Pfeffer and Dobler 2010).

In recent years, the incidence of diagnosed TBE cases has
increased throughout Europe. In addition, TBEV infections
emerged in new areas, for example, southern Sweden, Den-
mark, and France, possibly because of socioeconomic or cli-

mate changes (Haglund 2002, Bröker and Gniel 2003, Donoso
Mantke et al. 2008, Sumilo et al. 2008, Fomsgaard et al. 2009).

In Germany, most of the human TBE cases are reported to
occur in the southern federal states. Therefore, certain parts of
Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hesse have been classi-
fied as risk areas for TBE (Fig. 1). These risk areas are defined
by the incidence of human cases (RKI 2009, 2010). This
method of classification might be misleading because of in-
creasing vaccination rates in humans, particularly in risk ar-
eas, and a resulting decrease in the number of human TBE
cases. Additionally, the exposure of humans to ticks might
vary substantially in space and time and might thus also in-
troduce bias to the current risk-mapping approach (Kiffner
et al. 2010). Further, humans are accidental hosts rarely be-
coming infected, and quite often an infection will not be rec-
ognized because of unspecific symptoms, mild courses of
disease, or unawareness of physicians.

Ticks that have frequently been used in prevalence studies are
not suitable for TBEV monitoring because infection rates vary
greatly between local tick populations. Infections rates are usu-
ally below 1% even in highly endemic areas, for example, 0.23%
and 0.46% in recent studies from Germany and Switzerland,
respectively, implying high costs for collecting and screening
(Süss et al. 2004, Gaumann et al. 2010, Kup�ca et al. 2010).

Alternatively, terrestrial mammals could be used for TBEV
monitoring and the definition of risk areas, as virus or virus-
specific antibodies have been detected in nearly all species
studied so far (Radda 1973, Wurm et al. 2000, Mandl 2005,
Mansfield et al. 2009). In line with these findings, TBEV prev-
alence investigations by detecting TBEV-specific antibodies in
game animals such as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red fox
(Vulpes vulpes) and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cattle, and
goats) revealed reliable information (Radda et al. 1968, Wurm
et al. 2000, Klimes et al. 2001, Juceviciene et al. 2005, Lindhe
et al. 2009, Sikutova et al. 2009). However, because of their large
activity range as well as a lifespan of several years, the exact
time and site of an infection cannot be determined.

In contrast, TBE risk analysis based on prevalence studies
in small mammals, such as rodents, has advantages. They are
widespread in most ecological systems, have a small home
range, are easy to trap and monitor, and are heavily parasit-
ized by ticks, which probably results in higher TBE virus
prevalence (and thus lower associated costs) than in ticks.
Once infected with TBEV, they are supposed to develop a
persistent infection (Ernek et al. 1963, Kozuch et al. 1963,
Nuttall et al. 1994, Danielova et al. 2002, Süss 2003, Bakhva-
lova et al. 2006, Gray et al. 2009, Kiffner et al. 2011).

Therefore, in this study, we chose rodents as potential
sentinels for distribution analysis studies of TBEV. First, lab-
oratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally in-
fected with TBEV, and selected organs and blood were
analyzed for viral RNA and, in part, for virus particles over a
period of 100 days postinfection (dpi). The results obtained
should provide new information about replication, persis-
tence, and organ tropism of TBEV in wild rodents.

To assess the suitability of rodents as sentinels for virus
spread in nature, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped
in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany
with emerging autochthonous TBE cases, was determined by
real-time (RT)–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-
qPCR). The prevalence was compared with that in rodents
from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas.

Materials and Methods

Experimental infection of M. arvalis voles and organ
sampling

Twelve female, adult, outbred M. arvalis voles obtained
from the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Uni-
versity of South Bohemia, Czech Republic, which underwent
several generations under specific-pathogen-free conditions,
were infected by subcutaneous inoculation of 1000 plaque
forming units of TBEV strain Hypr (GenBank accession
number: U39292.1) isolated by Pospisil et al. (1954). At 5, 20,
50, and 100 dpi, two or three animals were killed and dis-
sected. Organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney) and
blood samples were frozen immediately at - 80�C for later
RNA extraction and virus cultivation.

Collecting and preparation of samples from rodents

Four hundred forty-one wild-living rodents were collected
in different federal states of Germany (Fig. 1) between 2002
and 2008 and necropsied according to standard protocols
established by the network ‘‘Rodent-borne pathogens’’ (Ul-
rich et al. 2008). Briefly, the collected rodents were frozen and
stored until necropsy. After identifying the species, weight,
size, and sex were determined. During necropsy, spleen and
brain tissue for TBEV analysis and additional tissues were
taken and stored at - 80�C until further analysis. The species
affiliation of TBEV-positive rodents was confirmed by a PCR-
based cytochrome b analysis.

Isolation of viral nucleic acids

Total RNA preparations from whole blood and cell culture
supernatant samples were obtained using the peqGOLD blood
RNA kit (PeqLab Biotechnology GmbH, Erlangen, Germany)
and the Qiagen viral extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany),
respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Tis-
sue samples were first homogenized with Fast-Prep FP120 (eu-
bio, Vienna, Austria). Afterward, RNA was extracted according
to the protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987).

Virus detection by RT-qRT-PCR and sequencing

To obtain cDNA, 5 lL of the RNA preparation was reverse-
transcribed in a 20 lL final reaction volume by Superscript II
kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Initially, the RNA was
incubated for 10 min at 65�C. The reverse transcription was
performed at 37�C for 60 min and at 93�C for 10 min in a
Biometra thermoblock cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany).
cDNA was tested by a TBEV-specific RT-qPCR as previously
described (Achazi et al. 2011). Sequencing of TBEV-positive
PCR samples was performed using the BigDye� Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Virus isolation and cultivation

Tissue samples were homogenized in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium and the homogenate was clarified by cen-
trifugation. The obtained supernatant was inoculated onto
Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586). Cell culture supernatant was
harvested at 4 days after inoculation for later RNA extraction.
To assess the presence of viable virus in the sample, the in-
oculated cell culture was maintained through sequential blind
passages over a period of 6 weeks.

Detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin
G antibodies

The detection of specific anti-TBEV immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies was done by an immunofluorescence assay
from EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with the following changes: as
secondary antibody, we used the FITC-conjugated goat anti-
mouse IgG antibody A90-216F from Bethyl (Montgomery,
TX). Samples were diluted 1:10 and 1:100.

Statistical analysis

Laboratory data were handled and analyzed using PASW
Statistics 17 (version 17.0.3; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 643



Results

As, at present, the knowledge on TBEV replication, persis-
tence, and organ tropism in rodent reservoirs is poor, 11 lab-
oratory-bred M. arvalis voles were experimentally infected with
TBEV. Selected organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and
blood) were taken at four different days over a period of 100
dpi and analyzed by RT-qPCR and, in part, by a virus isolation
approach (Table 1). Throughout the whole period of investi-
gation, no obvious clinical signs of infection were observed in
any of the animals. Beginning at 5 dpi, TBEV genome was
found in several organs, that is, brain, spleen, and liver, and at
50 dpi, all organs investigated were found to be RT-qPCR
positive (in at least one animal). At the final day of investiga-
tion, all three animals were found to be TBEV RNA positive in
at least one tissue. Mean copy numbers of the different organs
and on different dpi ranged from 4 · 100 to 3 · 106 genome
copies per mg organ or mL blood (Table 1). In the TBEV RNA-
positive animals, the highest copy numbers were found in the
brain at 5 and 20 dpi, but the initial copy number in the brain of
> 106 at 5 dpi decreased over time to 101 at 100 dpi.

Blood taken at 5 and 50 dpi (of one animal each) was found
positive for TBEV genome by RT-qPCR, indicating a viremia
in these two animals on these days. In contrast, all blood
samples from the three animals at 100 dpi were negative
(Table 1). In the control animal, TBEV-specific RNA was not
detectable in brain, spleen, kidney, or blood.

The persistence of infectious TBEV was confirmed by virus
cultivation and subsequent RT-qPCR on cell culture super-
natants for three RT-qPCR–positive tissue samples, that is,
brain samples from animals at 5 and 100 dpi and a liver
sample at 100 dpi (Table 1). The samples were chosen because
of their high viral load as well as to prove whether viable virus
could be recovered from tissue samples at 100 dpi. A typical
cytopathic effect was detected for all the brain tissue–inocu-
lated cell cultures at 5 and 8 dpi. In contrast, virus isolation
from the liver samples was successful only after two cell
passages and an observational period of 28 days until cyto-
pathic effect occurred and the supernatant could be tested
positive for TBEV genome (Table 1).

A clear titer of TBEV-specific IgG antibodies of > 1:10 could
be detected in all samples from 5 dpi on over the whole period
of investigation. No specific TBEV-IgG antibodies were de-
tected in the control animal.

To check the suitability of wild-living rodents as sentinels
for the spread of TBEV, the prevalence of TBEV was deter-
mined in spleen or brain samples from 259 rodents trapped in
Brandenburg. This prevalence was compared with that in 137
samples from rodents trapped in TBE risk areas in southern
Germany (Hesse) as well as with that in 45 samples from
rodents trapped in TBE nonrisk areas in northern and western
Germany (Fig. 1).

In 45 of 441 (10%) rodents, TBEV RNA was detected by
RT-qPCR in brain or spleen. The infection rates varied be-
tween 0% and 20% among the 13 trapping sites (Table 2 and
Fig. 1). The average TBEV prevalence in TBE risk areas was
about 15%. A statistically significant lower infection rate of

about 8% was found in animals from TBE nonrisk areas (v2

test, p = 0.049).
Sequencing of amplification products was performed, but

because of low copy numbers (mean copy number of rodent
spleen and brain samples tested positive on TBEV genome by
RT-qPCR = 67 copies per mg organ) and the short size of the
PCR fragment, the obtained sequence data were of poor
quality, so no subsequent subtyping and phylogenetic anal-
ysis were possible (data not shown).

TBEV genome was detected in rodents of six species, that
is, Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvati-
cus, Microtus agrestis, M. arvalis, and Myodes glareolus (Table
3). Infection rates in these species ranged from 7% to 29%.
No viral RNA could be detected in Mus musculus samples,
most likely because of a small sample size (n = 2). Statistical
analysis did not show any significant difference (v2 test) in
the infection rates of the different species. Interestingly, in
the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg, TBEV RNA was detected
in five rodent species, with the highest infection rates found
in M. glareolus (11%, 8/73), M. arvalis (11%, 2/19), and A.
agrarius (11%, 2/19). In the high-risk regions of Hesse and in
the nonrisk area of Saxony-Anhalt, three of four investigated
rodent species were found to be RT-qPCR positive, with the
highest rates in M. glareolus of 18% (11/63) and 9% (2/22),
respectively. Remarkably, A. flavicollis showed a higher in-
fection rate in Hesse (13%, 9/69) than in Brandenburg (2%,
1/50).

Also, there was no statistically significant difference
(v2 test) in the infection rates of male (11%, 24/216) versus
female (8%, 17/207) rodents or in the body mass of animals
found positive or negative for TBEV, respectively.

Discussion

The results of the experimental TBEV infectivity study in-
dicate a persistent infection in M. arvalis. Obvious clinical
signs of disease were absent despite high virus titers in the
brain. At 5 and 50 dpi, virus was detectable in blood, dem-
onstrating a long duration of viremia in some individuals.
However, the lack of detection of viral RNA in blood samples
drawn at 20 and 100 dpi may suggest an oscillation of the
viral load in blood. This assumption might be in line with the

previously reported short-term viremia found in other
mammalian (including human) hosts (Ernek et al. 1963,
Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981, Schultze
et al. 2007, Holzmann et al. 2009). The oscillation and vari-
ability in the process of infection in individual voles could be
attributed to the variable genetic background of the outbred
animals. Experimental TBEV infections in conventional in-
bred laboratory M. musculus–derived lines, such as Swiss
Albino or BALB/c mice, had a lethal outcome within 1–3
weeks as these mice suffer from a mutation in the Oas 1b
gene, which is supposed to be an interferon-induced effector
gene (Lindenbach and Rice 2001, Mandl 2005, Růžek et al.
2008).

The presented results prove that TBEV persists for at least 3
months in different organs and for > 1 month in the blood of
M. arvalis; however, virus titers decreased over time, partic-
ularly in the brain. These results support former studies with
other rodent species (M. glareolus and A. flavicollis) in which
TBEV could be detected in blood only up to 5 dpi and in
organs only up to 30 dpi by classical methods (Ernek et al.
1963, Smetana and Malkova 1966, Chunikhin et al. 1981).
Besides the different rodent species used in these studies, the
prolonged detection of TBEV RNA as well as viable virus in
the present study might be related to improved cultivation
techniques and the use of highly sensitive RT-qPCR diag-
nostic methods.

Also, anti-TBEV IgG antibodies could be detected from 5
dpi on over the whole 3 months. These results indicate a
normal immune response in the infected animals. It might be
interesting to analyze antibody titers over a longer period
than 3 months because in a former study with rodents from
Finland (Tonteri et al. 2011), antibodies could only be detected
in 2 of 16 rodents whose brain tissue tested positive for Eu-
ropean TBEV RNA.

The findings of the experimental study and the detection of
TBEV RNA in wild-living M. arvalis presented here supports a
previous study by Nosek et al. (1970) proposing M. arvalis as a
reservoir for TBEV. In line with these findings, related rodent
species such as M. agrestis and M. glareolus were also found to
contain TBEV RNA. TBEV RNA-positive M. glareolus voles
were trapped not only in the TBE risk area in Hesse but also in
the nonrisk areas in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Fur-
ther, in all trapping sites, M. glareolus voles showed the
highest infection rates. These results suggest that this species
might be the most important host for TBEV in Germany.

In Brandenburg, M. arvalis and A. agrarius showed similar
infection rates and therefore seem to be important hosts in this
federal state. In contrast, in Hesse, A. flavicollis showed the
second highest infection rate of about 10% and therefore may
substitute the role of A. agrarius and M. arvalis in the western
parts of Germany. This is especially interesting because the
geographical distribution of A. agrarius is restricted to the
eastern part of Germany (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999).

Because of high variation in sample size and sampling sites
of species in this initial study, the significance of the observed
differences in infection rates between different rodent species
has to be corroborated in future large-scale screening studies.
Altogether, previous investigations and our present study
suggest TBEV to be rather nonreservoir specific. The reasons
and mechanisms for this apparent unspecific virus–host
interaction are interesting issues for further investigations
(Kozuch et al. 1981).

RODENTS AS SENTINELS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF TBEV 645



The detection of TBEV RNA in rodents from four of five
districts of the federal state of Brandenburg and both inves-
tigated districts of Saxony-Anhalt raises questions on the
definition of risk areas, as these regions have not been clas-
sified as risk areas so far (RKI 2009, 2010). In future, based on
the number or proportion of infected rodent specimens per
area, a modified classification would be possible. Taking into
account the geographical distribution of the districts (Fig. 1), it
becomes evident that the trapping sites with rodents tested
positive for TBEV and previously classified as TBE nonrisk
areas are located in or near areas with autochthonous TBE
cases (light gray). In contrast, rodents trapped in a park in the
city center of Cologne (far away from TBE risk areas) are
found to be free of TBEV.

In Germany, the overall prevalence of TBEV-positive ro-
dents averaged at 10%. Therefore, Germany seems to be a
country of low TBE risk in comparison to a prevalence of 61%
in rodents of a high endemic area in Siberia (Bakhvalova et al.
2006). This rating is supported by the low incidence of human
TBE cases in Germany compared with other European
countries, for example, the Czech Republic or Russia (Donoso
Mantke et al. 2008).

In general, the infection rates vary strongly among the
different trapping sites. These variations are consistent with
the fact that TBEV are concentrated in so-called ‘‘natural foci,’’
habitat sites limited to a few square meters or square kilo-
meters (Pavlovsky 1966, Zeman 1997, Gritsun et al. 2003, Süss
2003, Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008), but could also be led
back by seasonal fluctuations, which could not be considered
because of missing data.

This investigation provides further direct evidence of TBEV
in Brandenburg (northeastern Germany) and is in line with
case reports on human TBE patients in Brandenburg (Süss et al.
1996, 2008, Becker et al. 2006, RKI 2009, 2010). Further, the
results demonstrate that TBEV is endemic in Brandenburg and
Saxony-Anhalt, federal states that have not been previously
classified as risk areas. This finding has important implications
for public health policy regarding vaccination strategies,
awareness training, and the definition of risk areas for TBEV.

We conclude that TBEV detection in rodents represents a
promising surrogate marker system for TBE, particularly in
areas of low TBEV circulation. Rodents are easy to capture,
show a persistent TBEV infection, and are ubiquitous in all
ecological systems. Future investigations should assess the
value and accuracy of this approach by parallel investigations
of ticks, rodents, or other host animals in high and low TBE
risk areas in Germany.

ABSTRACT: During 1988 and 1989, a serologic

survey of wildlife was conducted in northeast-
ern Mexico to determine the presence, preva-
lence, and distribution of arboviruses and other
selected disease agents. Eighty mammal speci-
mens were tested. Antibodies to vesicular sto-
matitis-Indiana, Venezuelan equine encephali-
tis-Mena II, Rio Grande virus, and vesicular
stomatitis-New Jersey were detected predomi-
nately in small mammals. Deer and mouflon
(Ovis musimon) had antibodies to bluetongue
and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Two species
had serologic evidence of recent exposure to

Francisella tularensis. A white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) had antibodies to An-
aplasma marginale. All specimens tested for an-
tibodies against Yersinia pestis and Brucella
abort us were negative. Sera from 315 birds were
tested for antibody against five equine enceph-

alitis viruses and six avian pathogens. During
1988, antibodies to Venezuelan equine enceph-
alitis-Mena II, Venezuelan equine encephalitis-
TC83, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine en-

cephalitis, and western equine encephalitis were
detected in birds of several species. Antibodies
to Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease
virus were also detected. Birds from five species
presented antibodies to Mycoplasma meleagri-
dis. Specimens tested for M. gallisepticum, M.
synoviae, and Chiamydia psittaci were nega-
tive. To the best of our knowledge, this survey
represents the first serologic evidence of blue-

tongue, Cache Valley virus, epizootic hemor-
rhagic disease, Jamestown Canyon virus, vesic-
ular stomatitis-Indiana, vesicular stomatitis-
New Jersey, Rio Grande virus, and tularemia
reported among wildlife in Mexico.

Key words: Arboviruses, avian cholera, dis-
ease survey, Newcastle disease, tularemia, wild-

life.

Much of the information known about

diseases in wildlife has been aquired from

serologic surveys. A number of factors,

however, such as viremia titer and dura-

tion, antivector behavior, and longevity

may bias results. Another limitation of se-

rology includes the size and distribution of

the samples. Samples from a single flock

or herd may be insufficient. Also, the trap-

ping technique may bias the composition

of the collection, resulting in a non-rep-

resentative sample of wildlife tested. De-

spite these limiting factors, serologic sur-

veys are considered important in that they

reveal evidence of the presence of disease

when apparent infections and clinical cases

have not been detected. Also, presence of

selected disease agents may be determined

when limited information is known about

a specific disease in a geographic area.

The prevalence of arboviruses in wild

vertebrates in Mexico has been previously

documented (De M ucha-Macias, 1963;

Campillo-Sainz, 1969; Scherer et al., 1971;

Dickerman et al., 1972b). Other disease

agents have been reported from wildlife

in that country. For example, Varela and

Vazquez (1954) isolated Yersinia pestis

from spleens of Mexican prairie dogs

(Cynomys mexicanus) trapped in the State

of Coahuila, demonstrating for the first

time that sy!vatic plague was present in

Mexico. However, we know of no serologic

FIGuRE 1. Study areas from which serum samples

were collected from wildlife for serologic survey,

surveys performed in wildlife in Mexico

since that time. The objective of this study

was to determine, through a serologic sur-

vey, the presence and prevalence of ar-

boviruses and other potential pathogens in

resident wildlife species from northeastern

Mexico.

The study areas, located in the states of

Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas,

Republic of Mexico (Fig. 1), have been

previously described (Bennett et a!., 1991).

Mammals and birds were captured in all

study areas from 18 May to 8 August 1988

and 10 June to 11 August 1989. Capture

techniques and field procedures used in

this study were similar to those described

by Sudia et al. (1970). Sherman traps and

leghold traps for mammals were operated

for not more than 3 days in the same study

area and were visited once a day early in

the morning. An average of 41 Sherman

trap-nights and five leg-hold trap-nights

were used during a 65-day period over the

two summers. Carnivores and other large

mammals were chemically immobilized

with ketamine (Ketaset, Bristol Labora-

tories, Syracuse, New York 66201, USA) at

recommended dosages (Jessup, 1982). At

the time of this survey, several wild-caught

species were temporarily held in corrals

and pens at Rancho San Francisco, Coa-

huila. For the purposes of this study, a

wild-caught captive animal included any

mammal or bird held in captivity for a

week or longer. Wild birds were captured

using mist nets at ground level for a total

of 560 net hours (1 net hr = one 12-m mist

net operated for 1 hr of daylight) (McLean

et a!., 1989). Nets were checked every 2

hr. Mist nets were set for 1 to 3 days on

the study sites from 8:00 to 17:00 each day.

Waterfowl and other birds species were

manually captured in nesting boxes or

while on ground nests (Markum and Ba!-

dassarre, 1989a, b). A number of nesting

black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocyg-

na autumnalis) were captured by hand at

night using a spotlight.

Blood specimens (0.5-10 ml) were taken

by venipuncture from the heart, radial,

tarsal or jugular veins, allowed to clot and

refrigerated overnight at 4 C. After blood

specimens were centrifuged, sera were re-

moved, placed in vials and frozen on dry

ice. In the laboratory, serum specimens

were heat-inactivated at 56 C for 30 mm

and tested by the plaque-reduction neu-

tralization test (McLean et a!., 1985, 1989)

for antibody against the following arbo-

viruses: St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) (TBH-

28 strain), eastern equine encephalitis

(EEE) (NJ-160 strain), Venezuelan equine

encephalitis (VEE) (TC83, lAB strain and

Mena II, 1E strain), western equine en-

cephalitis (WEE) (Fleming M I-2959B

strain), vesicular stomatitis-Indiana (VSV-

In) (lab strain), vesicular stomatitis-New

Jersey (VSV-NJ) (Haze!hurst strain), epi-

zootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) (New

Jersey strain), bluetongue (BT) [BT-13 (67-

41B) and BT-17 strains], Cache Valley vi-

rus (CV) (M23355 strain), Jamestown Can-

yon virus (JC) (61V2235 strain), Nepuyo

virus (NEP) (HBL7-2BG strain), and Rio

Grande virus (RG) (TBM4-719 strain).

hemagglutination inhibition control test

were used to detect antibodies against Y.

pestis (Wolff and Hudson, 1974). Titers

� 16 were considered indicative of expo-

sure. The micro-agglutination test was used

to detect antibodies against Francisella tu-

larensis. Titers � 128 were considered to

provide evidence of previous exposure

(Stewart, 1988). Serum specimens from

ungulate species were submitted to the U.S.

Department of Agriculture Brucellosis

Laboratory (Denver, Colorado 80211,

USA) for the detection of antibodies against

Brucella abortus and Ana plasma margin-

ale. Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle

disease virus antibodies were tested by us-

ing the ELISA Antibody Test Kit (Agritech

Systems, Inc., Portland, Maine 04101,

USA). Values for samples to known posi-

tive (S/P) ratio of �0.2 were considered

as not providing evidence of previous ex-

posure. Bird specimens obtained in 1988

were submitted to the National Animal

Health Reference Laboratory (Ames, Iowa

50010, USA) to test for serologic evidence

of exposure to Myco plasma meleagridis,

M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chla-

mydia psittaci. Serum samples obtained

during summer 1989 were tested for M.

gallisepticum and M. synoviae antibodies

by the stained antigen rapid plate agglu-

tination test (Intervet America Inc., Mills-

boro, Delaware 19966, USA).

Serum specimens from 80 mammals of

14 families and 21 species were tested for

antibody against 13 selected arboviruses,

Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. abortus, and A.

marginale. Results for serologic tests for

arboviral antigens in mammals are listed

in Table 1. During 1988, 12 species from

San Francisco presented antibodies to

VSV-NJ and seven species had antibody

to VSV-In. Of these, six species presented

antibodies to both viruses. In 1988, anti-

bodies to enzootic strain VEE-Mena II

were present in seven species predomi-

nated by small mammals. Antibody to

VEE-TC83 strain was detected in three

species including deer and two species of

lagomorphs. From all the ruminants tested

in 1988, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus vir-

ginianus texanus) was the only species with

serologic evidence of exposure to both BT

serotypes and EHD. During 1989, two of

six mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon) had an-

tibodies to BT. All other ungulate sera test-

ed negative to hemorrhagic disease. Desert

cottontail (Sylvilagus auduboni) was the

only species with serologic evidence to NEP

(1/6). Jackrabbits (Lepus calif ornicus) (3/

10) and a striped skunk (Mephitis me phi-

tis) trapped during summer 1988, had di-

agnostically significant titers (128) to F.

tularensis. A white-tailed deer serum had

serologic evidence of exposure to A. mar-

ginale. There was no evidence of exposure

to Y. pestis and B. abortus in the mam-

malian specimens tested.

Sera from 315 birds of 24 families and

44 species were tested for antibody to five

arboviruses and six other selected avian

pathogens (Table 2). During summer 1988,

birds from 14 species had serologic evi-

dence to the enzootic strain of VEE-Mena

II. Antibodies to P. multocida were de-

tected in five bird species in 1988 and two

bird species in 1989. Newcastle disease vi-

rus antibodies were also identified in two

species for both years. A scaled quail (Cal-

lipepla squamata) had a positive titer of

160 to M. meleagridis. No serologic evi-

dence to selected arboviral antigens was

found in 27 species of birds. Birds from 18

species had no antibodies to avian cholera

and Newcastle disease. No serologic evi-

dence of exposure to M. gallisepticum, M.

synoviae and C. psittaci was identified in

the bird specimens tested.

The present study indicates that trans-

mission of at least 12 arboviruses occurred

prior to the summers of 1988 and 1989 in

the mammal species tested in northeastern

Mexico. Previous evidence of exposure to

equine encephalitis viruses in wild and do-

mestic mammals has been reported in

Mexico (Scherer and Dickerman, 1972;

Gonzalez-Cortes et a!., 1975). An endemic

strain of VEE virus was isolated from opos-

Antibodies were detected in seven of 10

species of wild terrestrial mammals in two

endemic areas of Veracruz, Mexico (Scher-

er et al., 1971). Our survey identified an-

tibodies to VEE in a cottontail rabbit, a

white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leuco-

pus), and a raccoon (Procyon lotor), spe-

cies with historical serologic or virologic

identified five new species with serologic

evidence to VEE in Mexico including

striped skunk, white-tailed deer, kangaroo

rat (Dipodomys merriami), woodrat (Ne-

otoma mexicana), and jackrabbit. It is un-

known, however, if all of these species act

as effective reservoir hosts. Nepuyo virus

was isolated for the firsttime in Mexico in

1966 (Dickerman et al., 1971). There is

evidence that this virus is widely distrib-

similar to dengue. The present study pro-

year.

determined. During the present survey,

three of five blackbuck (Antilope cervi-

capra) obtained from Texas were seropos-

itive to VS V-NJ. These animals were sam-

pled the same day they arrived at Rancho

San Francisco, Coahuila. These results may

indicate activity of VSV in Texas. The im-

plications of disease movement caused by

wildlife translocations should be consid-

ered. Although virus isolation was not at-

tempted, the introduction of VSV into

Mexico is a possibility. VSV is indigenous

to the western hemisphere and epizootics

have occurred in southeastern United States

almost every year (Karstad, 1981). There

is extensive serologic and virologic evi-

dence of BT virus infection in domestic

livestock from Mexico (Stott et a!., 1989).

This study confirms exposure of white-

tailed deer to BT-13 and BT-17, strains

previously isolated in Mexico. To the best

of our knowledge this is the first confirmed

report of serologic evidence to EHD, VS-

NJ, VS-In, CV, JC, and RG in wildlife in

Mexico. These arboviruses are enzootic in

areas of the United States bordering Mex-

ico (Karabatsos, 1985).

Tularemia titers obtained in jackrabbits

and a skunk indicate that the disease may

be active in Mexico. Implications to hu-

man health are important since it is known

that jackrabbits are a source of food to

people in Mexico. To the best of our knowl-

edge, this is the first serologic evidence of

tularemia reported in wild mammals from

Mexico.

The present study indicates that the bird

species sampled were exposed recently to

four encephalitis viruses, of which three

have been reported previously in Mexican

birds. Campillo-Sainz (1969) found herons

and egrets from five species with antibod-

ies to SLE and WEE. SLE was isolated

from water birds in Veracruz, Mexico

(Dickerman et a!., 1972a). The present sur-

vey of waterbirds identified similar num-

bers of reactors to the ones previously re-

ported for VEE in resident birds collected

in southeastern Mexico (Dickerman et al.,

1972b).

It isknown that some mammals and birds

may develop persistent viremias and act

as amplifying hosts of these diseases in epi-

zootic situations (Dickerman et a!., 1972b;

McLean and Bowen, 1980; McLean et al.,

1985). At least three of the equine en-

cephalitis viruses (EEE, SLE, and VEE)

have caused epidemics in humans and epi-

zootics in horses in Mexico. The role of

wildlife in any of these outbreaks is un-

known. Birds appear to be particularly im-

portant in the ecology of arboviral diseases.

Mammals play an incidental role in the

natural cycle, but this fact does not exclude

the possibility of infection during epizootic

situations. SLE and other flaviviruses have

been present in Mexico for many years

(Sosa-Martinez, 1963). To the best of our

knowledge this is the first laboratory con-

firmed serologic report of EEE in wild

birds in Mexico. Further studies in the

prevalence, transmission, and ecology of

selected diseases in wildlife populations in

Mexico are required. Increasing data on

disease agents in a greater number of spe-

cies and scattered locations raise questions

regarding the possibilities of disease intro-

duction and exchange between geograph-

ical areas. There is supported evidence of

annual reintroduction of arboviruses from

areas south of the United States by migra-

tory birds (Stamm and Newman, 1963;

Calisher et a!., 1971; Dickerman et al.,

1980).

Surveillance for currently known dis-

eases and isolation of new etiologic agents

can be the initial attempt to establish the

laboratory confirmed status of selected dis-

eases in Mexico. The systematic collection

of samples to establish the presence of dis-

ease is essential in the continental man-

agement of migratory species as well as

other wildlife in North America.

Louping Ill in 
Goats, Spain, 2011

Although louping ill affects mainly sheep, a 2011 
outbreak in northern Spain occurred among goats. 
Histopathologic lesions and molecular genetics identifi ed a 
new strain of louping ill virus, 94% identical to the strain from 
Britain. Surveillance is needed to minimize risk to domestic 
and wildlife species and humans.

Louping ill is a zoonotic disease caused by a neurotropic, single-stranded, 40 to 50–nm RNA virus, which has 
been classifi ed in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. 
Louping ill virus belongs to a subgroup antigenically 
related to viruses known as the tick-borne encephalitis 
viruses (TBEVs) of Europe (1). These viruses are medically 
considered to be the most common fl aviviruses in Europe 
and Asia (2). Among them, the TBEVs, which infect 
thousands of humans per year (3), are related to louping ill 
virus. Most reports of louping ill virus originate from the 
British Islands; knowledge with regard to the strain from 
Spain is limited. Because it is a tick-transmitted disease, 
the distribution of louping ill is closely associated with the 
distribution of the primary vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus. 
It mainly affects sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus 
scotica), but many other species have been reported to be 
susceptible, including dogs, llamas, alpacas, goats, pigs, 
and humans (2).

Infection with a strain of louping ill virus from 
Spain was fi rst reported for sheep in the Basque region 
of northern Spain in 1987. For several years during the 
spring, mortality rates for lambs and yearlings in infected 
fl ocks were high (4). The causative agent was identifi ed as 
Spanish sheep encephalitis virus (SSEV) (5). Additional 
studies failed to isolate the virus from ticks (6) in the region 
where the fi rst cases occurred, indicating that prevalence 
of SSEV, if present, was low. To our knowledge, no cases 

of encephalitis caused by a fl avivirus in ungulates in Spain 
have been described since then.

Also to our knowledge, no cases of tick-borne 
fl avivirus infection in humans have been reported in Spain, 
although 1 case of tick-borne encephalitis in a person from 
southwestern France was considered to have been caused 
by an SSEV subtype virus (3,7). Therefore, except for the 
1 person in France, SSEV infections seem to be restricted 
to sheep and to the Basque region of northern Spain. We 
report suspected infection of a herd of Bermeya goats (an 
endangered breed of Asturian goats) with a TBEV.

The Cases
In September 2011, a herd of 70 adult goats was 

purchased in southern Asturias and then moved to northern 
Asturias. Within 1 month, 1 goat became ill. The fi rst 
sign was hindleg lameness, which quickly progressed to 
incoordination, fever, tremors, and bulging eyes. The goat 
died 2 days later, after which 17 other goats (including 2 
goatlings born on the farm) showed the same signs and died 
over a 4-month period. Many ticks were found on these 
animals (≈10–15 ticks/goat), and Butox (Merck, Madrid, 
Spain) was applied.

Necropsy was performed on 2 adult goats; gross 
lesions were recorded and special attention was paid to the 
nervous system. Samples for histopathologic examination 
were taken from the brain (cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, 
and brain stem), spinal cord, liver, kidney, adrenal glands, 
lungs, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. They were fi xed in 
10% neutral-buffered formalin, and 4-μm hematoxylin and 
eosin–stained sections were produced.

Samples of brain tissue were also taken for molecular 
analysis. Total RNA was extracted (TRIzol reagent; 
Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), treated with 
DNase 1 (Takara Bio Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and reverse 
transcribed into single-stranded cDNA by using random 
hexamers (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [avian myeloblastosis 
virus]); Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Real-
time RT-PCR primers designed to detect all viruses in 
the family Flaviviridae (8) were used in a conventional 
RT-PCR protocol, and a 231-bp amplicon was detected 
and sequenced (BigDye Terminator, version 3.1, Cycle 
Sequencing Kit protocol; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, 
CA, USA). To compare the phylogenetic relationships of 
the isolate virus with other representative TBEV  strains, 
we constructed an unweighted pair-group method analysis 
tree in MEGA 5 (9), by using published TBEV sequences 
(8) and the Three Arch Rock Island strain of Tyuleniy virus 
as an outgroup.

During necropsy of the 2 goats, no gross lesions were 
found. No histopathologic lesions were found in any organ 
system except the central nervous system (Figure 1). The

Louping Ill in Goats, Spain

cerebellum showed necrosis of Purkinje cells and neurons. 
Histopathologic examination of the rest of the brain revealed 
a mild meningeal infi ltration with widespread lymphocytic 
perivascular cuffs and evidence of neurophagia and gliosis, 
characterized by degenerating neurons surrounded by glia 
cells. These lesions were concentrated in the hypothalamus 
and midbrain and were more severe in the medulla 
oblongata and spinal cord. The histopathologic lesions 
observed in these goats were indistinguishable from those 
caused by louping ill virus (10).

Molecular genetic studies enabled identifi cation of the 
virus. The sequence (Genbank accession no. JQ646028) 
was 94% identical to the strain from Britain (EU074000) 
and 93% identical to the strains from Spain (EU074016) and 
the Negishi virus (EU074002), thus confi rming identity of 
the Asturian strain louping ill virus. Phylogenetic analysis, 
conducted by using the unweighted pair-group method 

analysis tree (Figure 2) shows how the new virus strain is 
related to the strains from Britain and Spain.

Conclusions
Histopathologic lesions together with molecular genetic 

results enabled a defi nitive diagnosis: tick-borne encephalitis 
caused by an Asturian strain of louping ill virus. These cases 
confi rm the infection in species other than sheep in Spain 
and the presence of the virus in areas of northern Spain other 
than the Basque region. An epidemiologic survey confi rmed 
that no clinical signs were observed for the source herd in 
southern Asturias. However, a few years ago, another herd, 
located in the same area to which the affected herd described 
here had been moved, showed similar signs; 8 of 20 goats 
died. Although a diagnosis was not confi rmed for this earlier 
outbreak, the facts suggest that the virus might have been in 
this area for several years.

The concern over fi nding louping ill in this area lies in 
its zoonotic potential. Numerous cases of human infection 
have been described (11). Humans can become infected in 
a variety of ways. Infections have been naturally acquired 
in persons who had direct contact with infected animals, for 
example on the farm or in laboratory settings (11,12). The 
virus can also be transmitted by direct mucous or respiratory 
pathways. Another route for infection is the consumption 
of milk from infected goats or products (cheese, butter, 
or yogurt) made from milk from infected goats (13). The 
presence of the virus in milk could represent a public health 
hazard if the milk is not pasteurized.

The Bermeya goat is considered to be at high risk for 
extinction, and many efforts have been made by breeders 
and the local administration of agriculture to limit the loss 
of genetic variability in these goats. The cases reported here 
provide an example of how an infectious disease can also 
reduce the local genetic resources. These cases, together 
with the case described in the Basque region, underline the 
need for a specifi c surveillance plan in northern Spain that 
focuses on ticks, wildlife species, and livestock. This plan 
will be crucial for determining the actual effects of louping 
ill on hunting, animal breeding, and human health.

Abstract 
We report the isolation of St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) virus from a mature male 

killer whale (Orcinus orca). This represents the first isolation of SLE virus from a 
marine mammal. The animal presented with reduced appetite, rapidly became lethar- 
gic and subsequently died. Virus-induced CPE was observed in a dolphin cell line, 
SP-1K (ATCC CCL 78), inoculated with brain, kidney, and lung tissues obtained at 
necropsy. Electron microscopy of infected SP-1 K cells revealed the presence of virions 
having morphology and size resembling members of the Flaviviridae. Final identifi- 
cation as SLE virus was made by neutralization and immunofluorescence staining 
tests. 

Key words: Flavivirus; Orcinus orca; Encephalitis; Marine mammal 

Introduction 

Case Report 

A mature male killer whale (Orcinus orca), estimated to be 25 or more years old, 
presented with reduced appetite. Within 24 h, the animal became lethargic. The 
animal died in September, 1990, within 48 h after the onset of clinical signs, while 
under veterinary care. The necropsy was unremarkable, but the histopathology 
examination reported a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. 

Laboratory Studies 

Virus isolation. Frozen samples of brain, lung, kidney and several other organs were 
sent to the ATCC Virology Laboratory as part of an ongoing screen for viruses of 
cetaceans. All tissues were thawed, mixed with sterile sand and tissue culture medium, 
and aseptically ground with a mortar and pestle. The suspensions were clarified by 
low-speed centrifugation (500 x g for 10 min) and the supernatants were used to

inoculate primary African Green Monkey kidney cells, SP-1K (a dolphin cell line, 
ATCC CCL 78) cells and bovine turbinate (ATCC CRL 1390) cells. Upon initial 
inoculation, bacterial contaminations were noted in all cultures. All first passage 
cultures were frozen, thawed and blind passaged on fresh cells in the presence of 100 
#g/ml gentamycin sulfate. Possible CPE was noted in SP-1K cells inoculated with 
the brain, kidney and lung samples. These samples were passed through a 0.2-#m 
filter and a third passage was made on SP-1K cells. A definitive CPE was then 
observed from the brain, lung and kidney samples; cells became rounded and refractile 
and detached from the flask. No further attempts were made to isolate the agent 
from the bovine turbinate and primary monkey kidney cells. 

The bacterial contaminants, although not identified, do not at this time appear 
related to the animal's death. Many of the necropsy samples received by ATCC for 
viral screening from cetaceans have bacterial or fungal contaminants. This is due in 
part to the cetacean's large size and insulating layer of blubber which make it 
impossible to quickly cool the animal after death. As a result, bacteria from the 
intestine and other non-sterile areas quickly multiply and spread throughout the 
peritoneal cavity. 

Electron microscopy. When infected SP-1K cells showed distinct CPE, they were 
removed from the flask and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for two hours. Fixed cell 
suspensions were sent to the VA Virology Laboratory in West Haven, Connecticut 
by overnight mail. The cells were postfixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in 
Spurr's resin as described previously (Hsiung, 1982). Thin sections were cut, stained 
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a transmission electron 
microscope (Fig. 1). For each of the three (brain, lung and kidney) SP-1K samples, 
numerous enveloped virus particles 40-50 nm in size were seen in the cytoplasm. 
Each particle had an electron-dense core 25 nm in diameter; virus particles budding 
from the plasma membrane were also observed (Fig. 1, inset). With the noted size 
and morphology, the isolate was tentatively identified as a member of the 
Flaviviridae family. 

Final identification. A virus preparation propagated from the brain sample, having 
a titer of 104.5 tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDso) was inactivated by exposure 
to 20% chloroform for two hours. A neutralization test on the same virus preparation 
was performed in SP-1K cells. Antisera to Japanese encephalitis virus (ATCC VR- 
1259AF) suppressed the appearance of CPE for 72 h, but CPE subsequently devel- 
oped. In contrast, antisera to St. Louis encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-1265AF) com- 
pletely neutralized the infectious virus through the entire 7 days incubation. In 
addition, acetone-fixed infected and non-infected SP-1K cells were sent to Dr. 
Karabatsos at the CDC Arbovirus Diseases Branch of the Division for Vector-Borne 
Infectious Disease, CDC in Fort Collins, CO, for confirmation. Using monoclonal 
SLE type-specific antibody (Roehrig et al., 1983), the three isolates were identified 
as St. Louis encephalitis virus by the immunofluorescent staining test (Nick 
Karabatsos, personal communication). It should be noted that, although two strains 
of SLE are available through the ATCC, neither has been propagated at the ATCC 
during the past four years that the marine mammal screening program has been 
active. Consequently, it is very unlikely that the three SLE isolates, from a single 
animal, were the result of cross-contamination from existing stocks.

Discussion 

We have been unable to find any reference to SLE virus infecting marine mammals 
in the current literature (McLean and Bowen, 1980; Buck and Schroeder, 1990; 
Kennedy-Stospkopf, 1990; Monath, 1990). Since 1933, when the SLE virus was first 
isolated from a human brain, there have been many recognized epidemics of St. 
Louis encephalitis in the United States. The clinical cases associated with these 
outbreaks, and the intervening endemic periods, have been most frequent in 
California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana (Monath, 1990). 

SLE is a member of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) antigenic subgroup of the 
Flaviviridae (Wengler, 1991). Wild birds appear to be the primary (maintaining) 
vertebrate host, and the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from infected viremic 
birds to susceptible birds. When conditions are suitable (large numbers of viremic 
birds and large numbers of mosquitoes), transmission to incidental hosts such as 
humans and horses occurs. Although several members of the JE subgroup are 



112 

pathogenic for humans, only the prototype JE strain is economically important as 
a disease of domestic animals (Fenner, 1987). SLE virus does not cause clinical 
disease in horses and other domestic mammals (Monath, 1990). Even in humans 
where SLE can cause severe encephalitis, many cases of SLE go undiagnosed or are 
subclinical (Monath, 1990). 

In the present case, the killer whale apparently contracted SLE virus during a 
recognized SLE outbreak in Florida (CDC, 1990a,b). It is likely that, as with humans, 
killer whales are incidental hosts in the SLE cycle. Other cetaceans in the vicinity of 
the infected animal showed no illness consistent with SLE and were seronegative for 
SLE antibody (data not presented). The absence of reports associating illness or 
death of any marine mammal with SLE or other member of the Japanese encephalitis 
group further suggests that infections of marine mammals by infected mosquitoes 
are quite rare or, as in the case of many terrestrial mammals, most SLE infections 
are subclinical. 

This report of an unexpected isolation of St. Louis Encephalitis virus from a 
cetacean demonstrates the importance of viral screening in animal species where the 
knowledge of viral pathogens is limited. The EM examination provided a rapid 
presumptive identification of an unknown agent which was confirmed by antibody 
neutralization and immunofluorescent staining tests. Studies are currently under way 
to identify two additional agents recently isolated in cell culture from other marine 
mammal specimens.

INTRODUCTION

The remarkable mammals known as “bats” and “flying
foxes” (order Chiroptera [“hand wing”]) may be the most
abundant, diverse, and geographically dispersed vertebrates
(Table 1). Although a great deal is known about them, detailed
information is needed to explain the astonishing variations of
their anatomy, their lifestyles, their roles in ecosystems ecol-
ogy, and their importance as reservoir hosts of viruses of
proven or potential significance for human and veterinary
health.

Bats fly with wings which range in span from 130 mm to 2 m.
Bats of various species feed on insects, mammals, fish, blood,
fruit, and pollen. Bats of most species echolocate to navigate
and to find prey. Bats are found on all continents except Ant-
arctica. Bats also are being increasingly recognized as reservoir
hosts for viruses which can cross species barriers (i.e., “spill

over”) to infect humans and other domestic and wild mam-
mals. Nonetheless, studies of the natural histories of bats and
their importance as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses largely
have been underappreciated and underfunded, except for their
role in maintaining and transmitting rabies virus. Irrespective
of the negative public perception of bats, they are critical
elements of all terrestrial biotic communities. They help con-
trol insects, reseed cut forests, and pollinate plants that provide
food for humans and other species, and their guano is used as
a fertilizer and for manufacturing soaps, gasohol, and antibi-
otics (21, 69, 83). Bat echolocation and signal processing have
provided models for sonar systems (112, 130).

Myths and misunderstandings about the roles of bats in
ecosystems and their danger to other species as hosts of rabies
virus have led to efforts to extirpate bat populations, with
serious consequent effects on insect control and crop produc-
tion, without coincidental reduction in the already low inci-
dence of rabies virus transmission by bats (93).

This paper summarizes what is known about viruses isolated
from bats. Although there is serologic evidence for infection of
bats with many viruses (see, for example, references 82 and
101), we will focus here only on the 66 viruses that have been

isolated from or detected in bat tissues (Table 2) and the roles
of bats in maintaining and transmitting viruses. Some of these
bat-borne viruses can cause diseases of humans and other
animals. The roles played by bats in the maintenance and
transmission of viruses require consideration of the unique
characteristics that distinguish bats from all other mammals.
Examples are drawn from the extensive literature on rabies
virus in bats, as well as from recent data on the roles of bats in
the natural cycles of other viruses.

Evolution and Phylogeny of Bats

Whereas other mammals, such as certain species of rodents
(order Rodentia) and carnivores (order Carnivora), may pos-
sess traits in common with species of bats, such as the ability to
hibernate, no group of mammals shares the full suite of at-
tributes that make bats unique. Of the more than 4,600 recog-
nized species of mammals, 925 (about 20%) are bats (147).
Bats are grouped into two suborders: Megachiroptera, contain-
ing a single family, Pteropodidae (42 genera, comprising 166
species), and Microchiroptera, containing 16 bat families (135
genera, comprising 759 species) (Table 1) (138).

Bats evolved early and have changed relatively little in com-
parison with mammals of other taxa (69). Although the fossil
record of bat evolution is incomplete (77), a recent analysis of
17 nuclear genes dated the origin of chiropterans to the Eo-
cene period (52 to 50 million years ago), coincident with a
significant rise in global temperature (147). Three major mi-
crochiropteran lineages were traced to Laurasia and a fourth
to Gondwana (147). The correspondingly ancient origins de-
duced for certain zoonotic viruses maintained in bats, such as
the henipaviruses (60) and lyssaviruses (10), suggest a long
history of cospeciation. Viruses that evolved with bats may
have used for replication cellular receptors and biochemical
pathways which are conserved in mammals that evolved later
and which underwent radiation in later geological periods. If
so, these conserved cellular receptors and pathways could en-
hance the capacity for transmission of bat-associated viruses to
other mammals.

Ability To Fly

Bats are unique among mammals in their ability to fly. Bats
fly daily in pursuit of food, and bats of many species fly long
distances during seasonal migrations (62). For example, bats of
Myotis spp. may travel 200 to 400 miles from their winter
hibernation sites (reviewed in reference 62), and Mexican free-
tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) migrate at least 800
miles between their summer caves in Texas and New Mexico
and their overwintering sites in Mexico (36) and are otherwise
very widely distributed. In France, rabies virus infections have
been associated with the migratory routes of Nathusius’ pipis-
trelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) bats (20). Silver-haired bats (La-
sionycteris noctivagans) seasonally range from Alaska, across
Canada, and south to Texas (13). Rabies virus variants associ-
ated with silver-haired bats and the Eastern pipistrelle (Pipis-
trellus subflavus) have been identified from numerous locations
throughout the geographic range of these bats (106, 124), and
the same variants have been identified as the cause of the
majority of cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the
United States and Canada (127).

Different patterns of migration within the same species of
bat, as occurs with relatively solitary species, such as the silver-
haired bat (69), and colonial cave-dwelling species, such as
Mexican free-tailed bats (128), may permit exchange of novel
viruses or virus variants between migrating and nonmigrating
subpopulations of conspecifics or bats of other species. A Mex-
ican free-tailed bat infected with a rabies virus variant normally
associated with hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), suggests inter-
species transmission (124). In the field, rabid bats of one spe-
cies have been observed to be aggressive toward bats of other
species (14). Moreover, Shankar et al. (136), in a study of the
phylogenesis of divergence of rabies viruses from bats and
terrestrial animals in Colorado, found that bats of different
species had the same genotypic variants, indicating active in-
terspecies transmission of rabies virus. They concluded that, at
least in Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats and
that identification of bat-associated variants of rabies viruses in
domestic cats, gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and
striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) demonstrates the impor-
tance of rabies virus spillover from bats to domestic and ter-
restrial wild vertebrates.

Torpor and Hibernation

An important trait of temperate bats of the families Vesper-
tilionidae and Rhinolophidae is their ability to enter into daily
torpor and seasonal hibernation to conserve energy during
cool nights and winter months (89). The impact of torpor and
hibernation on the pathogenesis and maintenance of viral in-
fections in bats has not been studied extensively. However,
viruses may overwinter in bats, and persistently infected bats
may shed viruses, such as lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae)
or flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) for extensive periods with-
out evidence of disease (143). Virus isolation and antibody
studies suggest that many viruses can cause persistent infec-
tions in bats (82).

When big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats
(Myotis lucifigus) were experimentally infected with Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) and then subjected to temperatures

tibody titers. Nevertheless, the fact that infectious JEV was
recovered from seropositive bats 15 weeks after the shift in
temperature indicated that infection persisted (143). It is pos-
sible that neutralizing antibody has a shorter half-life in bats
than in other mammals. Tick-borne encephalitis virus and
other viruses have been isolated from bats with neutralizing
antibody, and bats are susceptible to reinfection with tick-
borne encephalitis viruses (82).

High titers of virus were obtained from brown fat of appar-
ently healthy bats inoculated with rabies virus when the bats
were kept at low temperatures (4, 142, 143). Vampire bats
(Desmodus rotundus) that survive challenge with rabies virus
may excrete virus in their saliva (1). Rabies virus was isolated
from big brown bats that were captured to establish colonies
and then died in the first month of captivity (135). Antiviral
antibodies were detected in sera of several apparently healthy
bats born in the new colony, suggesting past or subclinical
rabies virus infection (135). Mexican free-tailed bats may trans-
mit rabies virus transplacentally, as evidenced by the fact that
infectious virus was isolated from cell lines established from
fetal tissues of these bats (141). Studies of Mexican free-tailed
bats roosting at a colony in Austin, Texas, identified rabies
virus in about 70% of several hundred downed, dead, or dying
bats, which represented a relatively small proportion of the
estimated 600,000 bats in that colony. Over the study’s 2-year
duration, about 45% of apparently healthy bats from this roost
were found to have neutralizing antibody to rabies virus, sug-
gesting acquired immunity following prior exposure (101; C.
Rupprecht [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Ga.], personal communication, 2006). Because only
one or another of many methods usually is applied in studies
of rabies virus in bats, we do not know the proportion of bats
having both viral RNA in their tissues and antibody to rabies
virus.

Temperate and tropical bats of the family Molossidae ap-
pear to be transitional between true hibernating bats and trop-
ical bats that have limited ability to enter torpor. For example,
the Western bonneted bat (Eumops perotis) enters a period of
daily torpor during the winter that is similar to the daily hiber-
nation or torpor that occurs in temperate zone bats during the
summer (89).

Long Life Span

The extreme longevity of bats, together with the possibility
that they might develop persistent infections with certain vi-
ruses, may help maintain the viruses and transmit them to
other vertebrates. Many species of small temperate bats of the
suborder Microchiroptera have life spans that exceed 25 years,
with the greatest longevity, of 35 years, documented for a little
brown bat. (On average, little brown bats weigh about 7 g.)
This extreme longevity in a small mammal places bats well
outside the traditional regression line for mammals that relates
the life expectancy (9) to the ratio of metabolic rate to body
weight (see reference 44, Fig. 45).

If bats routinely become persistently infected by certain vi-
ruses, and infectivity lasts for months or possibly years, the
impact on the basic reproductive number of infection (R0)
would be significant. R0 is the expected number of newly in-
fected hosts that one infectious host will produce during its

period of infectiousness in a large population of completely
susceptible individuals (65). Since R0 is the sum of the products
of the average duration of infection, the average contact rate
between infectious and susceptible individuals, and the prob-
ability of transmission per contact between an infectious and a
susceptible individual, increased duration of infectiousness or
increased prevalence of infection in a population can dramat-
ically enhance the potential for secondary infections that em-
anate from a single infected individual. Persistent viral infec-
tions occurring among long-lived bats, coupled with their often
gregarious roosting behavior, could greatly increase the poten-
tial for intra- and interspecies transmission of viruses.

Population Size and Roosting Behavior

The frequently great population densities of bats and their
crowded roosting behavior increase the likelihood of intra- and
interspecies transmission of viral infections. Bats are the most
abundant of mammals, and except for humans and perhaps
rodents, they are the most widely distributed land mammals
(154). Certain species of bats, such as Mexican free-tailed bats,
are highly gregarious and roost in southwestern caves of the
United States, such as Carlsbad Caverns and Frio Cave, in
densely packed aggregates of approximately 300 bats per ft2

(37), in populations comprising several million individuals (37,
94). Under these conditions the only example of airborne ra-
bies virus transmission was documented, either in droplets of
excreta or by small particle aerosol (38, 155).

Bat Population Structure

The demographic and spatial structuring of bat populations
is sufficiently variable to offer opportunities for viruses that
cause both acute and persistent infections to be maintained.
The potential for migratory and nonmigratory populations to
serve as a mixing vessel for viruses has already been men-
tioned. Additionally, within given regions, bat populations may
be panmictic or may exist as metapopulations, offering the
potential for seasonal virus transmission and annual outbreaks
of viral diseases as well as the potential for periodic outbreaks
among spatially discrete populations.

Colonial microchiropterans (such as Schreibers’ long-fin-
gered bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Mexican free-tailed
bats) typically exist in panmictic populations of hundreds of
thousands or millions of individuals and produce an annual
birth pulse (37). In theory, such large bat populations could
sustain acute viral infections that produce permanent steriliz-
ing immunity in affected individuals in a manner akin to that of
measles morbillivirus, which persists to cause annual outbreaks
only when human communities exceed 250,000 to 500,000 (16).
The persistence of measles virus within demographically het-
erogeneous human populations, whereby different communi-
ties are affected in different years, may give rise to viral per-
sistence in spatially discrete “patches,” in which infection dies
out sequentially rather than simultaneously (17).

A different pattern of social structure is present among other
colonial bats that have a metapopulation structure (consisting
of periodically interacting, spatially discrete subpopulations).
Flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) have such a structure. In this sit-
uation, the total number of individuals in the various subpopu-

VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 535



lations or “patches” must be sufficient to maintain virus circu-
lation in the metapopulation over time, while immunity or
death due to viral infection extinguishes transmission chains
within individual subpopulations. Periodic outbreaks of viral
infection and disease may then be expected among given sub-
populations in a region, once the number of susceptible indi-
viduals has recovered through births or loss of immunity, such
that the populations once again can support viral transmission
with an R0 of �1. Such periodic outbreaks of acute, even fatal
viral disease are well documented for rabies virus among ter-
restrial carnivores (28) and may occur among vampire bats, as
exemplified by the so-called “migration” of rabies virus in
vampire bat populations in different regions with a 2- to 3-year
cycle (19, 126). Preliminary modeling suggests that Hendra
virus persists in Australian flying foxes in this way (H. E. Field,
unpublished data).

Given that the phylogenetic distance of Hendra virus (and
Nipah virus) from other viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae
suggests that these are ancient viruses that likely have an
evolutionary association with their flying fox hosts, it is both
intuitive and biologically plausible that the maintenance of
Hendra virus infection in flying foxes is based on the spa-
tially heterogeneous population structure and nomadic na-
ture of flying foxes.

Echolocation

Microchiropteran bats are, with rare exceptions among the
Megachiroptera (69, 71), the only land mammals that emit
sounds and then detect and characterize the time delay and
signal properties of returning echoes for the purpose of navi-
gation (echolocation). Although certain birds and several spe-
cies of megachiropterans use primitive echolocation, the de-
gree to which neural and muscular systems of bats have
evolved to produce echolocation signals, protect the individual
bat from its own potentially deafening emissions, and decipher
the information contained in returning echoes is unique. How-
ever, acoustic imaging is energy-intensive, corresponding to an
energy flux of as much as 6 � 10�6 J/m2 per echolocation call
(113). The intense, high-frequency echolocation signals, rang-
ing between 80 and 110 dB at a distance of 1 m from the
emitting bat, approximate the range between the noise level
produced by a coffee grinder and that produced at a rock
concert or by a jet plane at ramp (5, 113). Echolocation signals
are produced by the larynx, are powered by the muscles of the
abdominal wall of bats, and are emitted through the mouth or
nostrils (113). Production of such loud sounds also could gen-
erate droplets or small-particle aerosols of oropharyngeal flu-
ids, mucus, or saliva, enabling transmission of viruses between
individuals in close proximity. The hypothesis that rabies virus
could be expelled from the nostrils of echolocating bats was
supported by the isolation of rabies virus from mucus obtained
from naturally infected Mexican free-tailed bats (39).

Bat Immunology

Why can certain viruses infect and persist in apparently
healthy bats yet be highly pathogenic for humans and other
vertebrates? Because bats were among the earliest mammalian
species to develop, it is possible that their innate and acquired

immune responses have important qualitative or quantitative
differences from those of the rodents and primates which have
been studied extensively. Do bats have a different set point in
their immune responses, one that results in control of the level
of virus replication without clearance of infectious virus in
order to prevent immunopathological responses in infected
tissues? Are all of the innate immune mechanisms that are
presumed to have preceded the development of acquired im-
mune responses also functional in bats? Is there affinity mat-
uration of antibodies in bats? What are the properties of cell-
mediated immune responses in bats? Significant differences in
immune responses to viral infection likely will be found among
the very large number and diversity of bat species, and it is
unlikely that immunological reagents will be reactive across all
bat species.

Very little is known about bat immune systems, although
several studies suggest that immune responses of bats have
some similarities with those of mammals that evolved after
bats. For example, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM
have been purified from sera of great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus
lituratus) (96). Macrophages, B- and T-lymphocyte-like cells,
and cells expressing surface Ig were identified in the bone
marrow of Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), indicating
that lymphoid development is generally similar in bats and
other mammals (26, 131). Presumably in bats, as with other
mammals, the generation of high-titer IgG requires two events
mediated by helper T cells: class switching and affinity matu-
ration.

Serological assays that detect IgG antibodies to Hendra vi-
rus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-
CoV)-like viruses, and Ebola viruses in bats (66, 84, 85) indi-
cate that some virus-specific adaptive T- and B-cell responses
occur despite persistent virus infection. Further studies will
require development of cell culture-based assays for examining
lymphocyte proliferation, antibody synthesis, cytokine synthe-
sis, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats.

VIRUSES FOUND IN BATS

Table 2 lists the large number of viruses that have been
isolated from or detected in bats, but most of these viruses
have not been shown to be transmitted from bats to other
animals or to cause human disease. Transmission from bats of
viruses causing highly pathogenic disease has been demon-
strated for rabies virus and related lyssaviruses, Nipah and
Hendra viruses, and inferred for SARS-CoV-like virus of bats.
The relationships of these viruses to their bat hosts and to
zoonotic human diseases is described below. Other viruses in
Table 2, such as certain alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunya-
viruses, may infect bats via arthropods, but it is not clear
whether bats are important reservoir hosts for these viruses.
Clearly, a great deal of additional research is needed to doc-
ument the roles of bats of different species in the natural
history of the many viruses for which these remarkable animals
can serve as hosts.

Rabies Virus

It would be impossible here to summarize the scientific lit-
erature with regard to rabies and rabies virus. Therefore, we

536 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV.



will merely summarize what we believe is relevant to this re-
view. Descriptions of a disease consistent with rabies date from
4,000 years ago. The Eshnunna code invoked penalties for
knowingly allowing a “mad” dog to bite a human (12). In the
first century of this era, Celsus warned of fatal bites from
animals and suggested that such bites may contain venom (i.e.,
“virus”). However, it was not until the late 19th century that
rabies virus was studied methodically. Louis Pasteur amplified
the virus in rabbit spinal cord and prepared and administered
a vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis. Those classical studies
laid the foundations for virology and immunology.

Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, sero-
type 1/genotype 1) is transmitted between mammals, including
bats, primarily through the bite inoculation of rabies virus
present in the saliva of infected individuals (95). The dual
characters of transmitting rabies virus and being hematopha-
gous (i.e., vampire bats) have cast a shadow on bats. Bats of
three species (Diphylla ecaudata [hairy-legged vampire bat],
Diaemus youngi (white-winged vampire bat), and Desmodus
rotundus [vampire bat]) are known vampires and have been
found to be involved in transmission of rabies virus, although
available evidence indicates that only the latter is important in
this regard (149).

Globally, a vanishingly small proportion of the approxi-
mately 55,000 annual human deaths caused by rabies virus are
caused by variants of virus associated with bats (81). Although
most cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the
United States are caused by bat-associated variants of rabies
virus, the average of 1 or 2 cases per year over the past 2
decades indicates the rarity of these events (101). In the United
States, most rabies victims do not recall having been bitten by
a bat, which may be due to the small size of the biting animal
or to unusual circumstances leading to the bite (127).

Recent evidence suggests that all rabies virus variants that
affect terrestrial carnivores originated from cross-species trans-
mission of bat-associated variants of rabies virus (10). A mo-
lecular clock model based on genetic divergence of rabies virus
variants in bats of different species suggests that in North
America the divergence of extant bat-associated rabies viruses
from a common ancestor occurred about 1651 to 1660 C.E.
The bat rabies virus variants found in Latin America in com-
mon vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and in free-tailed bats
(genus Tadarida, family Mollosidae) are closest to the earliest
common ancestor. Adaptation of rabies virus variants occurred
earlier and more rapidly in bats of colonial genera (genera
Eptesicus and Myotis) than in bats of more solitary genera
(Lasionycteris, Pipistrellus, and Lasiuris) (74).

Bat variants of rabies virus sporadically spill over to infect
mammals other than humans (97). Sustained transmission of
bat variants of rabies virus within populations of red foxes on
Prince Edward Island and striped skunks in Arizona (40, 45)
proceeded until natural extinction or control by vaccination.

Lyssaviruses Related to Rabies Virus

Rabies virus is related to other lyssaviruses from bats, ro-
dents, and arthropods (137). There are seven lyssavirus geno-
types and an additional four novel genotypes recently recov-
ered from bats in Eurasia (Table 2), which probably will be
included in this genus (67, 151). Some of these viruses, most

notably Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) (140), can cause a
fatal human illness indistinguishable from classic rabies (68,
129), but other lyssaviruses are not known to cause disease in
vertebrates. The diagnosis of rabies in humans and animals
traditionally was restricted to the acute fatal encephalomyelitis
caused by rabies virus serotype 1/genotype 1, but now the
disease “rabies” includes any of the fatal illnesses caused by
any lyssavirus (67).

Details of the maintenance cycles for lyssaviruses other than
rabies virus, such as Duvenhage, Lagos bat, and Mokola vi-
ruses (Table 2), are unclear (111). However, as with rabies
virus, their perpetuation is assumed to involve bite transmis-
sion, primarily involving conspecifics of the reservoir host spe-
cies, with occasional spillover to other susceptible vertebrates.
Individuals of other species have been sporadically found to be
infected by these rarely identified lyssaviruses, including a hu-
man with Duvenhage virus (100, 144), domestic cats and a dog
with Lagos bat virus (54, 80, 98), and humans, domestic cats,
and dogs with Mokola virus (15, 46, 47, 53, 110).

In May 1996, a lyssavirus was isolated from tissues of a black
flying fox (Pteropus alecto) with signs of encephalitis found
near Ballina, New South Wales, Australia (55). Six months
later, a bat handler from Rockhampton, Queensland, Austra-
lia, developed numbness and weakness in her arm and later
died from encephalitis. She had been infected with what is now
known as ABLV. In 1998, a woman from Mackay (Queens-
land, Australia) was diagnosed with ABLV infection at her
death, 2 years after having been bitten by a sick bat (68).
Protection trials with mice conducted at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., indicated that a
rabies human diploid cell vaccine might be useful for prophy-
laxis against this virus (90). Recent serologic evidence suggests
that this virus also is present in bats in Thailand (88). Because
of the colonial nature of many bats, it is likely that this virus
may be found wherever the host bats are found.

Henipaviruses

In 1994 an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness occurred
in a human and 14 horses in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane,
Australia. Twenty-one horses and two humans (the trainer and
a stable hand) were infected (109). Four additional outbreaks,
in 1994, 1999, and 2004, infected five horses and two humans,
killing all but one human (49, 72, 116, 123, 133).

A virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus [named
after Hendra and Nipah viruses]) was shown to be the etiologic
agent of this disease (109). The natural hosts and probable
reservoirs of Hendra virus are fruit bats (“flying foxes”) of the
genus Pteropus, including the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto),
gray-headed flying fox (P. poliocephalus), little red flying fox
(P. scapulatus), and spectacled flying fox (P. conspicillatus)
(50). Little is known about the dynamics of infection in flying
foxes and how Hendra virus infection is maintained in them.

Field (50) proposed three alternative models for the main-
tenance of infection: (i) infection is enzootic in all species
throughout their distribution; (ii) infection is enzootic in a
particular species with a periodic epizootic pattern in the other
species; or (iii) infection is periodically epizootic in all these
species, persisting in a spatial or temporal mosaic across their
distribution. He contends that the apparent pattern of known

“spillovers” from flying foxes to horses fits better with either of
the two latter hypotheses. That is, a periodic outbreak in a
local population of flying foxes results in an increased proba-
bility of spillover to horses in a specific locality during a limited
time period. An outbreak of Hendra virus infection in a local
population of flying foxes may depend on attainment of a
threshold number of susceptible flying foxes in the population
and introduction of the virus into the population from a no-
madic individual or group. These concepts are well studied for
related morbilliviruses (17, 146). A situation analogous to the
circumstances being proposed for spillover of Hendra virus to
horses has been described for rabies virus spillover to domestic
cats. In the eastern United States, there is a strong association
between the local temporal dynamics of rabies epizootics
within a reservoir host species, in this case the raccoon (Pro-
cyon lotor), which serves as the regional reservoir host for a
specific variant of rabies virus, and an increase in the risk of
rabies spillover to domestic cats (59).

Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus related to Hendra virus, was
first isolated in 1999 from pigs and adult human males affected
by fever and encephalitis, some with respiratory illness, during
a major outbreak in peninsular Malaysia and then in Singapore
(23, 24, 31). Of 265 reported human cases, 105 were fatal.
Direct contact with infected pigs was identified as the predom-
inant mode of human infection (33, 57). Most of the humans
affected in the Malaysian outbreak had a history of direct
contact with live pigs, and most were adult male Chinese pig
farmers (31, 117). More than 1 million pigs were culled to
contain the outbreak. With the knowledge that Pteropus spe-
cies bats were the likely reservoir of the closely related Hendra
virus in Australia, Malaysian bats were prioritized for surveil-
lance. Like most other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia
has a great diversity of bat species, including 13 species of
Megachiroptera and 60 species of Microchiroptera (99). The
large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and the variable flying fox
(P. hypomelanus) were found to be natural reservoir hosts for
Nipah virus (34, 76).

Since 2001, sporadic outbreaks of Nipah virus-associated
disease in humans have been identified in Bangladesh (6, 7, 8,
73). Although many characteristics of these outbreaks were
similar to those of the Malaysian outbreak, including delayed
recognition, a primary presentation with fever and central ner-
vous system signs, and a high case fatality rate, in Bangladesh
the human cases were not associated with disease in pigs, and
there was some evidence suggesting human-to-human trans-
mission (73). Serologic surveys of domestic and wild animals
undertaken after the 2001 and 2003 outbreaks in Bangladesh
provided evidence of Nipah virus infection only in Indian flying
foxes (6, 73). Concurrent serologic surveillance of Indian flying
foxes in India in 2003 found that 54% had neutralizing anti-
bodies to Nipah virus (J. H. Epstein et al., personal commu-
nication, 2006), suggesting that Nipah virus or a closely related
virus was widespread across the range of Indian flying foxes.
Chadha et al. (25) recently reported the occurrence of Nipah
virus infections in humans in India in 2001. Neutralizing anti-
bodies to Nipah virus were found in large flying foxes in Indo-
nesia (134) and Cambodia (114), and Nipah virus was isolated
from Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Cambodia (121). Thus,
the henipaviruses likely occur across the entire global distribu-
tion of pteropid bats (66).

Available evidence suggests that Hendra and Nipah viruses
are ancient viruses that have long circulated in their natural
hosts, flying foxes (60). What precipitated the apparent recent
emergence of these viruses? Can we identify environmental
factors that altered flying fox ecology and facilitated the move-
ment of henipaviruses (and other bat-associated zoonotic
agents) beyond their natural ecological niches? Disease emer-
gence requires, in addition to the presence of an agent, an
effective bridge from the natural host to a susceptible spillover
host. Such bridges may be caused by changes to the agent, the
host, or the environment. Data on fruit bats of many species
suggest that populations are in decline throughout their range,
primarily as a result of habitat loss and hunting. In Australia,
fruit bat roosting sites recently have been increasingly redis-
tributed to urban areas (64). A scenario emerges of flying fox
populations under stress, altered foraging and behavioral pat-
terns, and virus niche expansion, all leading to closer proximity
to humans and livestock. This certainly was the case with Nipah
virus emergence (35). Chong et al. (30) suggested that the risk
of humans contracting Nipah virus infection from bats is low.
Once Nipah virus escapes its natural cycle, its epidemiologic
characteristics are quite a different story.

Menangle and Tioman Viruses

Menangle virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Rubulavirus)
was isolated in 1997 from stillborn piglets at a large commer-
cial piggery near Menangle in Australia (118); the bat colony
and the piggery had coexisted for 29 years before the incident.
There were large numbers of within-litter fetal deaths at a
variety of gestational ages. Most sows carried their litters to
term, but abortions occasionally occurred. Affected litters in-
cluded mummified, autolyzing, fresh stillborn, and live piglets.
Teratogenic defects frequently seen included arthrogryposis,
brachygnathia, and kyphosis. Internally, part or all of the brain
and spinal cord was absent in most piglets, and there was
malacia and nonsuppurative inflammation of the brains and
spinal cords of some. Nonsuppurative myocarditis and hepati-
tis also were present in some piglets (118).

Two of 250 humans in contact with the infected pigs had
high titers of antibodies to the new virus, and both reported a
febrile illness with a measles-like rash, but neither had direct
exposure to flying foxes (27). Individual bats living in a large,
mixed colony of gray-headed flying foxes and little red flying
foxes seasonally, and roosting within 200 m of the affected
piggery, had neutralizing antibodies (118), as did flying foxes of
other species from other colonies thousands of kilometers dis-
tant and previous to the outbreak at Menangle (Field, unpub-
lished); other species in the vicinity of the affected piggery were
seronegative. Although attempts to isolate virus from flying
foxes were unsuccessful, paramyxovirus-like virions labeled
with antibody to Menangle virus from a convalescent sow were
seen by electron microscopy in flying fox feces collected be-
neath the roost near the piggery.

Tioman virus, a rubulavirus distinct from Menangle virus,
has been isolated from variable flying foxes in Malaysia. Little
is known about the host range or pathogenesis of this newly
recognized paramyxovirus (32).

SARS-CoV-Like Viruses of Bats

In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus (family
Coronaviridae) was found to cause a new, severe acute respi-
ratory syndrome in humans (92, 125). This virus, named
SARS-CoV, is a distant relative of the group 2 coronavi-
ruses that infect rodents, cattle, dogs, pigs, and humans and
has been assigned to group 2b (58). It is distinct from two
other coronaviruses recently identified in bats in southern
China (84, 119).

Epidemiologic studies showed that the earliest cases of
SARS were associated with the wildlife meat industry. A survey
of wildlife in a Shenzhen market recovered SARS-CoV-like
viruses from masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon
dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and detected antibodies to the
SARS-CoV-like virus in a hog badger (Arctonyx collaris) (63).
Interestingly, the epidemiology of the outbreak in animals in
the wildlife meat market resembled that of shipping fever, a
viral syndrome that occurs when animals from different farms
are comingled under crowded, stressful conditions. Under such
circumstances, immune responses to persistent virus infections
are reduced, virus shedding is increased, and susceptible ani-
mals become infected and shed virus. In the marketplace
where SARS-CoVs were detected, viral RNA from some ani-
mals that were seronegative was detected by reverse transcrip-
tion-PCR, suggesting acute infection, while other animals had
antibodies to SARS-CoV but continued to shed virus, suggest-
ing persistent infections (63). Although no pathology was as-
sociated with SARS-CoV in animals in this market, civets
inoculated with human isolates of SARS-CoV had severe lung
pathology (156). By sequencing many viral genomes from
SARS patients, wild and farmed civets, and other animals, a
dendrogram was generated that showed that the first human
SARS coronaviruses were closely related to a contemporary
virus from masked palm civets and that point mutations were
selected and accumulated later, as the virus passed from hu-
man to human (139).

Extensive surveys of viruses in domestic animals, poultry,
and wildlife were done by reverse transcription-PCR to iden-
tify the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Palm civets were
found to be an incidental host rather than the principal host for
SARS-CoV. Recently, several groups simultaneously identified
bats from different locations in southern China as being in-
fected with SARS-CoV-like viruses or having antibody to these
newly recognized coronaviruses, including members of several
species of Chinese horseshoe bats (suborder Microchirop-
tera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) (Tables 1
and 2) (42, 84, 86). The prevalence of antibody to bat SARS-
CoV in some species of Chinese horseshoe bats was as high
as 84%. Pathology has not yet been associated with SARS-
CoV infection of bats.

The genomes of SARS-CoV isolates recovered from civets
and humans during the 2002-to-2003 outbreak of SARS lay
phylogenetically within the broad group of SARS-CoV-like
viruses of bats (86). These data show that the virus responsible
for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this
group of bat-associated viruses. Antibody against SARS-CoV-
like viruses of bats was also detected in Leschenault’s rousette
(Rousettus leschenaultia), a cave-dwelling megachiropteran,
suggesting that fruit bats also may support infection with

SARS-CoV-like viruses. Thus, the natural history of SARS-
CoV appears to involve a previously unrecognized SARS-
CoV-like virus of bats being transmitted in meat markets to
amplifying hosts, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs,
and a hog badger, and then spilling over to infect humans in
close contact with these intermediate hosts or their tissues.
Subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus was
associated with adaptive mutations in the viral genome (139).

Ebola Viruses

Five viruses have been placed in the taxon Filoviridae. Four
of them (Ebola Zaire virus, Ebola Sudan virus, Ebola Ivory
Coast virus, and Ebola Reston virus) comprise the genus Ebo-
lavirus; Marburg virus comprises the genus Marburgvirus. The
natural reservoir hosts of these viruses have not yet been iden-
tified. However, Ebola virus RNA has been detected in terres-
trial mammals in the Central African Republic (107). Experi-
mental infections of the Angola free-tailed bat (Mops
condylurus), little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus), and
Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) with
Ebola Zaire virus led to replication of virus in these bats (145).
Recently, Ebola virus RNA was detected in liver and spleen
tissues of three fruit bats: the hammer-headed fruit bat (Hyp-
signathus monstrosus), Franquet’s epauletted bat (Epomops
franqueti), and little collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata)
(85). Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin M antibody was de-
tected in bats of the same species, but Ebola virus RNA was
not detected in bats with antibody, and antibody was not de-
tected in bats with Ebola virus RNA.

Detection of Ebola virus RNA in bats and rodents is a
fascinating finding, as is detection of antibody. However, until
and unless an Ebola virus (or Marburg virus) is isolated from
a wild vertebrate, and experimental infections unambiguously
demonstrate that the virus not only persists but is shed by that
animal and that disease can be transmitted under controlled
conditions, these findings will remain simply intriguing and
promising. Monath has postulated that there may be an as-yet-
undetected Ebola virus, one that is nonpathogenic but may
give rise to pathogenic genotypes by mutation, and that the
filoviruses may be arthropod or plant viruses (105).

IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON
EMERGING VIRUSES OF BATS AND

OTHER WILDLIFE

Emerging Viruses and Wildlife Surveillance

Scores of newly recognized viruses have emerged in recent
decades, and elegant reviews have brought into focus the con-
tinuing importance of this phenomenon (91). It seems surpris-
ing, as though we are caught unawares, when a hitherto un-
recognized disease and its causative virus are discovered.
Recognition of the spillover of a zoonotic virus is precipitated
by human, livestock, or wildlife deaths, with considerable med-
ical, emotional, and economic miseries. We wonder how such
a virus could have evaded detection, why it had not been seen
to cause disease before, and whether it is a “new” virus. When
new emerging zoonotic viral diseases appear, reviews and grant
applications are written, explanations proffered, symposia or-

ganized, and molecular and other specific diagnostic tools de-
veloped. Unfortunately, one important method to predict
emergence of zoonotic diseases that has been overlooked re-
peatedly is the natural history survey, followed by targeted
studies of species of interest identified through the survey.
Survey research followed by targeted study has been used suc-
cessfully to explore the epidemiology of reservoir host-zoo-
notic virus maintenance, as exemplified by studies on hantavi-
ruses in the southwestern United States (102, 103). These
studies have helped epidemiologists and public health officials
make recommendations to reduce the risk of infection and to
help forecast the location and severity of future outbreaks of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (22, 51, 52, 56).

From about 1930 to about 1970, governments and private
institutions emphasized sending people into the field to count,
trap, measure, bleed, and test vertebrates and invertebrates for
viruses. Although those surveys may not have provided answers
directly and quickly, they did provide specimens for future
analyses and questions to be addressed. Many “orphan” viruses
without known connection to disease were discovered. Infor-
mation regarding more than 500 viruses was collected by the
American Committee on Arthropod-Borne Viruses and pub-
lished in the International Catalogue of Arboviruses Including
Certain Other Viruses (78). This invaluable but badly outdated
compendium is slowly being replaced by Internet resources as
a means of information dissemination. Supplementing and re-
placing this printed catalogue are numerous databases (e.g.,
ICTVdB, The Universal Virus Database of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, available at http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/). Nevertheless, most of the cur-
rent data are limited in scope and in imagination. What is
needed is a survey of viruses of all vertebrates, inverte-
brates, plants, and other life forms. Although thoughts of
complete surveys obviously are wishful thinking, some sur-
vey efforts are better than none.

Information about the natural history of most viruses in bats
is limited. Regarding the conservation status of 914 bat species
listed by Wilson (153), omitting those that are, or are suspected
to be, extinct, 390 (42.7%) are considered not assessed (ade-
quately), 297 are considered stable, 201 are considered vulner-
able or potentially vulnerable, and 26 are considered endan-
gered. Of the 390 species that have not been assessed
adequately, 38 (9.7%) are of the family Pteropodidae, the Old
World fruit bats, from which the most recent virus emergences
have been observed. These 38 represent 59.4% of the 64 gen-
era in this family, indicating that we know relatively little about
the bats from which zoonotic viruses that cause human disease
have recently emerged. To various degrees, this can be said
about all bats, if not about all vertebrates.

Obviously, there is a need for comprehensive surveys of bats
in every place where they occur, although conservation con-
cerns must be addressed in the design of survey and sampling
methods, given that bats of many species are protected. Non-
killing techniques involving bleeding or procuring of oropha-
ryngeal and rectal swabs for PCR-based analyses, in addition
to collection of recently dead individuals, have been used to
determine viral infections and the prevalence of antibodies in
bats (see, e.g., references 43, 114, and 115). We know very little
about the 925 bat species that have been recognized, placed in
a taxon, and largely ignored after that. How many unrecog-

nized viruses do those bats harbor? Will any or all of these
viruses eventually be shown to be human, livestock, or wildlife
pathogens? What new viruses lurk in the other nearly 4,000
species of mammals and the thousands of species of other
vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and individuals of other
kingdoms, phyla, and classes? In effect, without even partial
predictive capacity, we are simply waiting for the next disas-
trous zoonotic virus outbreak to occur. Clearly, this is not an
effective prevention or prediction philosophy.

However, there is no simple solution to this need. Perhaps
part of the problem is lack of interest (ignorance?), and part is
due to lack of funding (there is not enough money for every-
thing). Surely in some countries, principally those from which
emerging disease are emerging, there is a lack of infrastruc-
ture, manpower, and even national will; these are political
questions. We suggest holding international symposia empha-
sizing the importance of both natural history surveys and of
knowledge as not only predictive tools but also disease-preven-
tion tools. Further emphasis on greater prioritization of such
studies might be shown to be very cost-effective in the long run.

Virus Isolation and Characterization

Virus isolation techniques and PCR assays now are ex-
tremely sensitive and rapid. These methods could provide the
opportunity to collect and store a massive amount of informa-
tion to accompany bat sera and tissue specimens. This would
provide us with at least some degree of intellectual prepared-
ness and with reagents that could be used to develop rapid
diagnostic assays for newly emerged viruses.

When a newly recognized virus is detected, virus identifica-
tion is now done by PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid, and
the resulting sequence data are compared with sequences in
the genetic databases, such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nih
.gov/GenBank/), to search for similarities with sequences of
recognized viruses. In addition, viral proteins (antigens) can be
expressed and used for serodiagnostic tests. If possible, the
infectious virus is isolated, antigens are prepared for diagnosis,
and experimental infections are conducted to study pathogen-
esis. Emerging viral diseases often are misdiagnosed. For ex-
ample, when the Nipah virus infection was first reported in
Malaysia in 1999, the diagnosis was “JEV infection,” even
though (i) all the human patients were adult males, (ii) most or
all of those people had been vaccinated against JEV, (iii) pigs
suffered fatal disease (pigs do not die when infected with JEV;
they serve as amplifying hosts for that virus), and (iv) a virus
isolated from patients with the disease appeared by electron
microscopy to be a paramyxovirus, not a flavivirus, as JEV is.
Only after it was realized that an intensive JEV vaccination
campaign was not diminishing transmission of this new disease
were other approaches initiated; by then, valuable time and
many lives had been lost. That outbreak can serve as an exam-
ple of our perpetual following of epidemic curves rather than
predicting them, of our lack of early recognition of emerging
diseases.

Diagnostic Limitations

At this time, diagnostic reagents or tests are available for all
the viruses shown in Table 2. However, to detect previously

540 CALISHER ET AL. CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV.



unrecognized viruses, new reagents and approaches must be
developed or existing techniques applied. Among the new re-
agents, a variety of nested primers useful for exploratory PCR
might be formulated based on knowledge of sequences of recog-
nized viruses within the order Mononegavirales (which includes
Bornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae
[120]). In addition, bat family-specific or genus-specific conjugates
could be produced and applied for use in immunofluorescence
assays or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to identify an-
tibodies in sera or blood samples, or antigens in tissue samples.
Classical methods including hemagglutination-inhibition tests,
which are broadly cross-reactive, also could be developed using
inactivated antigens prepared from various recognized viruses.
Virus isolation assays, while potentially quite hazardous, also can
be applied if used with appropriate biocontainment. In this day of
increasing emphasis on molecular genetic tools for detecting viral
nucleic acids and for identifying nucleotide sequences rather than
the viruses themselves, it is frequently overlooked that virus iso-
lation provides us with a virus. With the virus itself, many areas of
research and development can be addressed, including develop-
ment of diagnostics, of animal disease models, and of vaccines.
Emphasis, sometimes complete emphasis, on nucleotide se-
quence characterization rather than virus characterization has led
us down a primrose path at the expense of having real viruses with
which to work.

Studies on Immune Responses of Bats

To understand the innate and acquired immune responses of
bats during acute and chronic virus infections, much additional
research is needed. It will be necessary to develop bat cell
culture-based assays and bat-specific reagents to examine lym-
phocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine synthesis, cell-
mediated immune responses, and a host of other immunologic
functions in bats that are important reservoirs of emerging
viruses. A major challenge in studying T-cell responses in bats
is the apparent lack of inbred strains of bats. Such animals are
needed for long-term T-cell studies because of the require-
ment for matched major histocompatibility complex molecules
on T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Colonies of captive bats
might carry zoonotic viruses that could be transmitted to hu-
mans, so research on the bats and their cells might require
biological containment. In rodents, the growth factors required
for in vitro expansion and maturation of bone marrow stem
cells into competent antigen-presenting cells have been par-
tially characterized, leading to development of cell culture
assays for intermediate-term propagation of rodent T cells
(41). Similar strategies likely can be employed for propagation
of T cells from bats of various species.

Molecular genetics should be useful for analyzing bat im-
mune responses. More than 4,000 protein-encoding sequences
from chiropterans are in the National Center for Biotechnol-
ogy Information databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), but
of these only sequences for recombination activation genes 1
and 2 are immunologically relevant. Despite this limitation, it
should be possible to develop assays for evaluating such re-
sponses in infected bats. Perhaps most tractable and meaning-
ful for understanding these responses are analyses of cytokines
and chemokines, especially in conjunction with cell culture
assays. Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and flow

cytometry-based assays for a number of cytokines and chemo-
kines from conventional species have permitted an elegant
dissection of immune responses in humans and rodents. How-
ever, development of monoclonal antibody pairs for cytokine
detection assays requires substantial funding and effort. More
recent developments employing molecular approaches, such as
real-time PCR, cDNA arrays, and RNase protection assays,
have accelerated development assays for cytokine and chemo-
kine gene expression. These assays will require sequencing of
bat orthologs, but considering that 11 assemblies of mamma-
lian genomes are already available, it is likely that most genes
from bats of most species could be cloned and sequenced using
degenerate PCR primer sets, a strategy that has been used for
other species (132). Once the relevant gene sequences are
known for bats of a given species, real-time PCR assays could
be developed. In conjunction with cell culture studies, it should
be possible to characterize bat immune responses to challenge
with viral antigens. Bacterial artificial chromosome libraries
are available for the little brown bat and the greater horseshoe
bat, a species closely related to the Chinese horseshoe bat
(Rhinolophus sinicus), a host for SARS-CoV-like virus (84;
http://bacpac.chori.org/libraries.php). These resources may be
particularly valuable for rapidly identifying immune response
or cytokine genes of interest by using human or mouse hybrid-
ization probes.

Immune Evasion and Virus Persistence

Viruses must evade the host immune response for a time
sufficient to allow transmission to other susceptible hosts or to
establish persistent infection. The strategies employed by vi-
ruses are numerous and target both the innate and adaptive
phases of the immune response. Some commonly employed
evasion strategies include virus-encoded immune-modulating
cytokines, decoy soluble cytokine receptors, inhibitors of apop-
tosis and cellular signaling, inhibitors of antigen processing,
and T-cell antagonists (2, 3, 18, 61, 70, 79, 87, 104, 150, 152).
To persist, viruses must also become biochemically adapted, so
that they can replicate without severely compromising the
host’s survival.

Some viruses, including SARS-CoV, elicit an immune re-
sponse in the nonreservoir host that may contribute to pathol-
ogy (75, 148, 157) while apparently, at least for SARS viruses,
not causing immunopathology in the reservoir. Elucidating the
immune responses in reservoir hosts that determine the bal-
ance between virus persistence and immunopathology could
contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis in hu-
mans and reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Some paramyxoviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses,
encode V proteins that bind to signal transducer and activator
of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 proteins of host cells to
block both alpha/beta and gamma interferon responses (122).
How the viral proteins might affect potential interferon re-
sponses to virus infections in bats is unknown. Possibly the V
proteins play a role in viral persistence and evasion of the
immune response. Addressing these important issues regard-
ing the pathophysiology of viral infections in bats will require
the development of infection models for reservoir species of
each zoonotic virus.

With regard to bats, there is evidence that “healthy bats” can

VOL. 19, 2006 BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES 541



be asymptomatically infected with rabies virus. In nonlethal
rabies infections produced in Mexican free-tailed bats, individ-
uals surviving infection do not have virus in the brain or saliva.
In one experimental study of free-tailed bats inoculated with
salivary gland tissues from naturally infected bats, the incuba-
tion periods were 24 to 125 days, but one asymptomatic bat
sacrificed at the end of the study had rabies virus in the brain,
salivary glands, and other organs (11). Incubation periods for
rabies virus are certainly highly variable in bats, and persis-
tence of virus in hibernating bats has been suggested as serving
a viral reservoir function (143). A carrier state for rabies virus
has also been suggested by experimental and observational
studies among dogs in Ethiopia (48).

Discovery of Emerging Viruses in Wildlife

It is, perhaps, instructive that viruses of the families
Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Bornaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae
are phylogenetically related and have been grouped in a single
order, the Mononegavirales (120). There are at least 250 rec-
ognized viruses in this order, including some that infect hu-
mans, other primates, livestock, birds, dogs, seals, fish, crabs,
mosquitoes, ticks, amoebae, plants, or bats. If there is an un-
recognized tendency for bats and viruses to be associated,
viruses of this order would be prime targets for beginning the
search.

Essentially every living life form investigated has been shown
to host viruses, and bats are no exception. However, it is rea-
sonable to query the roles of viruses of bats. What role, for
example, does a fruit-eating bat play in the life cycle of a
human or livestock pathogen? If human and livestock infec-
tions from bats simply are host-switching phenomena, why
have these viruses not been recognized previously, and why
have they emerged now? Are these events the results of eco-
logic alterations, such as impingement of human activities on
heretofore virgin areas, consequences of global climate
change, or the product of improved surveillance activities co-
incident with the technical advances in diagnostic capabilities
required to identify heretofore undescribed zoonotic viruses?

Are viruses of bats symbionts, parasites, or commensals? Is
pathogenicity for humans and livestock simply a freak occur-
rence? Perhaps these emerging bat viruses are naturally trans-
mitted by arthropods or by other potential vectors that have
not been examined. Surely a fatal infection in a host is not in
the long-term best interest of the virus. Might fruit-eating bats
transmit viruses to or from plants? How? Are insectivorous
bats intermediate hosts between insects and vertebrates (or
plants)? Are fruiting events part of periodic amplification cy-
cles of viruses from frugivorous bats to wildlife and humans, as
suggested by Dobson (42)? Childs summarized the processes
by which zoonotic viruses are transmitted (29). He noted the
rarity of surveillance for wildlife diseases or infections and
suggested that such studies usually are outbreak-driven, i.e.,
after an epidemic of a newly recognized virus has emerged.

Outbreaks of Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus,
SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats, and European bat lyssavirus 1
(108) have not been recognized more than once or a few times.
Are transmissions between bats and other vertebrates infre-
quent, incidental spillover events? Do many of the 66 viruses
listed in Table 2 represent fortuitous, irrelevant events, or have

we detected only the tip of the iceberg? Do bats differ from
other mammals in their ability to clear viral infections? Does
the persistence of asymptomatic viral infections in bats indicate
that bats are an important reservoir for the wide variety of
viruses in nature? Is the prevalence of RNA viruses in persis-
tent infections in bats indicative of a defect in host resistance
or viral clearance mechanisms, such as interferon or interferon-
responsive genes that lead to clearance of RNA viruses from
other vertebrates? There is some urgency to explore these impor-
tant questions.

There is no reason to believe that bats are different from
other mammals with regard to species specificity of host sus-
ceptibility to virus diseases, nonuniform persistence of viral
infections, or mechanisms of virus shedding, so that such in-
vestigations likely do not require development of new assay
systems or diagnostic concepts. Additional research is needed
to determine the roles played by bats of various species in the
natural histories of the viruses for which bats can serve as
hosts.

One or more of the 66 viruses listed in Table 2 have been
isolated from bats of 74 species. As well, viruses have been
isolated from bats not identified further than to genus level and
from four unidentified bats. Some viruses have been isolated
from bats of as few as 1 species and one from as many as 14.
Clearly, bat handlers, people entering bat habitat areas, and
people who usually think in noninfectious disease terms re-
garding various studies of the bats themselves should take
necessary precautions to avoid exposing themselves to recog-
nized and unrecognized viruses and to other human pathogens
which the bats may harbor.

ABSTRACT: We conducted surveillance for
flavivirus infection in peridomestic rodents
in Merida, Mexico in 2011–12. We captured
161 rodents inside private residences, using
Sherman traps, including 86 house mice (Mus
musculus) and 75 black rats (Rattus rattus).
Serum from each animal was assayed by
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)
using two vertebrate-specific flaviviruses (Apoi
and Modoc viruses) and five mosquito-borne
flaviviruses (dengue 2, dengue 4, St. Louis
encephalitis virus, West Nile, and yellow fever
viruses). Sixty-one (37.9%) rodents had anti‐
bodies that neutralized at least one virus.
Prevalences for flaviviruses were 64.0% and
15.1% for black rats and house mice, res‐
pectively. None of the PRNT90 titers exceeded
80, and often they were highest for Modoc
virus. These data suggest that a subset of
rodents had been infected with Modoc virus
or a closely related flavivirus that was not
included in the PRNT analysis.

Key words: Flavivirus, Mexico, Modoc vi-
rus, rodents, surveillance.

Rodents often live in urban environments
in proximity to humans, causing serious
implications for public health (Meerburg
et al. 2009). Many zoonotic viruses have
rodents as reservoir hosts, and rodent-borne
zoonotic viruses of particular concern in-
clude those in the genera Hantavirus (e.g.,
Hantaan and Sin Nombre viruses), Arena-
virus (e.g., Lassa virus), and Alphavirus
(e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus).
Several human pathogens in the genus
Flavivirus have rodents as reservoir hosts
including tick-borne encephalitis virus in
Europe and Asia (Mansfield et al. 2009),
Powassan virus in the northeastern US,
Canada, and Russia (Ebel 2010), and Kyasa-
nur Forest disease virus in Asia (Hol-
brook 2012).

There is limited information on the prev-
alence of flaviviruses in rodents in Mexico
despite the enormous burden that these
viruses place on human health. Of particu-
lar concern is dengue virus (DENV), which
is distributed throughout Mexico and
causes large outbreaks of dengue fever
and life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic
fever each year (Tapia-Conyer et al.
2012). Dengue virus is primarily main-
tained in a primate-mosquito transmission
cycle, but detection of DENV RNA in
wild rodents, marsupials, and bats suggests
that nonprimates may occasionally serve as
reservoir hosts (de Thoisy et al. 2009).
West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis en-
cephalitis virus (SLEV) are also human
pathogens that occur in Mexico (Farfan-
Ale et al. 2006). Both are primarily main-
tained in bird-mosquito transmission cycles
although evidence suggests that some ro-
dent species are competent reservoirs for
WNV (Platt et al. 2008). We determined
the prevalence of DENV, WNV, SLEV,
and select other flaviviruses in small, peri-
domestic rodents in Merida, the largest
city on the Yucatan Peninsula.
Rodents were trapped inside 20 houses

in a 92-km2 area of Merida. Trapping was
performed at each house for three consec-
utive nights each month, October 2011–
September 2012. Twelve traps were placed
each night. Each house had a cement floor
and roof, cement walls, a small backyard,
potable water and electricity, and most
had screened windows. All houses were
within 100 m of vacant lots that contained
a large amount of domestic trash or veg‐
etation. Rodents were captured using

Sherman traps (839323 cm, H. B. Sher-
man Traps Inc., Tallahassee, Florida,
USA) baited with oats and sunflower seeds.
Trapping was performed with permission
of the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y
Recursos Naturales (permit 31D8B-
01373/1305). Captured rodents were eu-
thanized by CO2 inhalation and identified
to species and sex using morphologic keys
(Emmons 1990; Reid 2009). Blood was col-
lected from each animal by cardiac punc-
ture, dispensed into VacutainerH tubes
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New
Jersey, USA), placed on wet ice, and trans-
ported to the laboratory. Samples were
microfuged and supernatants were collect-
ed and stored at −80 C. Animals were han-
dled in accordance to protocols approved
by the appropriate Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees. All animals
appeared healthy at the time of capture.
Sera were assayed by plaque reduction

neutralization test (PRNT) following stan-
dard protocols (Beaty et al. 1995). The
PRNTs were performed using five mos-
quito-borne flaviviruses: DENV-2 (strain
NGC), DENV-4 (strain 241), SLEV (strain
TBH-28), WNV (strain NY99-35261-11),
and yellow fever virus (YFV; strain YF-
17D) as well as two rodent-associated flavi-
viruses that have no known arthropod vec-
tor (NKV): Modoc virus (MODV; strain
M544) and Apoi virus (APOIV, strain origi-
nal). Although YFV and APOIV are not
known to occur in Mexico, they were in-
cluded in the PRNTs to detect antibodies
to unrecognized YFV- and APOIV-like
viruses that may be circulating in the area.
We selected an antigenically diverse group
of flaviviruses to reduce the likelihood of
flavivirus-specific antibodies remaining un‐
detected. We obtained DENV-2, DENV-
4, SLEV, andWNV from theWorld Health
Organization Center for Arbovirus Refer-
ence and Research at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Division
of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in
Fort Collins, Colorado, US; YFV, MODV,
and APOIV were obtained from the World
Arbovirus Reference Collection at the

University of Texas Medical Branch in Gal-
veston, Texas, US. The PRNTs were per-
formed in 6-well plates using African
green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera
were tested at a starting dilution of 1:20.
Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of
serum dilutions yielding $90% reduction
in the number of plaques (PRNT90).
We captured 161 rodents of two species;

86 housemice (Musmusculus) and 75 black
rats (Rattus rattus). Thirteen (15%) house
mice and 48 (64%) black rats were PRNT-
positive for flavivirus. Sixty-one (37.9%)
rodents had antibodies that neutralized at
least one virus. The PRNT90 titers for the
positive black rats were usually highest for
MODV although no titers exceeded 80 (Ta-
ble 1). Twenty-five rats had MODV
PRNT90 titers of 20, eight had titers of 40,
and two had titers of 80. The two rats with
titers of 80 (R-35 and R-77) could be con-
sidered seropositive for MODV because
these titers are at least fourfold greater
than that of the other viruses tested. How-
ever, because a PRNT90 titer of 80 is not
particularly high and because all other
positive rats had antibodies to an undeter-
mined flavivirus, these two animals were
assigned the conservative diagnosis of
“seropositive for MODV or a MODV-like
virus” to avoid potential misdiagnosis. All
of the positive house mice had antibodies
to an undetermined flavivirus (Table 2).
None of their PRNT90 titers exceeded 40.
Our data indicate that flaviviruses are

a cause of infection in two species of peri-
domestic rodents in Merida. In most
instances, the flavivirus(es) responsible for
these infections were not identified. Most
of the positive rodents were black rats and
often their PRNT90 titers were highest for
MODV. However, because all of the titers
were relatively low, it is likely that these
animals were infected with a MODV-like
virus that was not included in the PRNTs.
The etiologic agent could be Cowbone
Ridge virus, Jutiapa virus (JUTV), Sal Vieja
virus (SVV), or San Perlita virus (SPV). All
of these are NKV flaviviruses that belong
to the Modoc serogroup and are known to

Control 1984). These viruses were not in-
cluded in the PRNTs because they did not
form distinct plaques in any of the cell lines
that we tested (Vero, BHK-21, and LLM-
CK2). Another explanation is that a subset
of positive rats had been infected with
MODV but high antibody titers were not
generated because the virus replicates poor-
ly in some species of rodents. Deer mice
(Peromyscus maniculatus) experimentally
infected with MODV produced low anti-
body titers when analyzed by serum dilution
neutralization tests; none had titers .40
(Davis and Hardy 1973). Flavivirus-neutral-
izing antibody titers steadily decline over
time, so another explanation is that some of
the positive rats had been infected with
MODV, but none of the infections were re-
cent. As observed with the black rats, all of
the positive house mice had low PRNT90
titers. None of the house mice had PRNT90
titers .40, and usually their titers were
higher for the mosquito-borne flaviviruses
than for the NKV flaviviruses. Explanations
for these findings include: 1) a subset of pos-
itive mice had been infected with one or
more of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses in-
cluded in the PRNTs, but none of the infec-
tions were recent, 2) a subset of positive
mice may have been exposed to another,

perhaps unrecognized, mosquito-borne fla-
vivirus that was not included in the PRNTs,
and 3) the etiologic agent was not identified
because some of the positive mice and rats
had been exposed to more than one fla‐
vivirus. However, previous studies have
demonstrated that rodents sequentially
challenged with heterologous flaviviruses
develop high antibody titers (Tesh et al.
2002).
Anecdotal evidence suggests that

MODV was a cause of aseptic meningitis
in a young boy who had handled a sick
mouse (Davis and Hardy 1973). Direct con-
tact with virus-contaminated rodent urine
could be a mechanism by which MODV
(and potentially MODV-like viruses) are
transmitted to humans. Experimental stud-
ies have shown that MODV is chronically
shed in urine of golden hamsters (Mesocri-
cetus auratus) for several months (Adams
et al. 2013). Modoc virus was also detected
in urine of experimentally infected deer
mice for up to 6 d (Davis et al. 1974).
Other serologic investigations have pro-

vided evidence of flavivirus exposure in
small rodents. Antibodies to flaviviruses
were detected by blocking enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 10 of
19 (53%) house mice, 17 of 41 (41%) deer

common. With increasing urbanization and
the continual emergence of novel zoonotic
pathogens, it is likely that peridomestic
rodents will have an increasingly important

Abstract

In South America, dengue is the arbovirus-transmitted disease with the highest incidence. Unlike other ar-
boviruses, wild mammals have no confirmed role in the cycle of dengue in the neotropics, although serologi-
cal studies have suggested a possible secondary amplification cycle involving mammals other than nonhuman
primates. In French Guiana, where all four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) are present, the
disease is endemic with outbreak events. To determine whether wild mammals can be infected by DENV, ro-
dents, marsupials, and bats were captured over several periods, from 2001 to 2007, at two sites. The first loca-
tion is a secondary forest surrounded by an urban area where dengue is endemic. The second location is a for-
est edge site where the disease has not yet emerged. A total of 10,000 trap-nights were performed and 616
mammals were captured. RNAs representing the four DENV serotypes were detected at both sites by reverse-
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the livers and/or sera of 92 mammals belonging to 14 out of 32
species distributed among all the orders investigated: Rodentia (33 positive/146 tested), Marsupialia (40/318),
and Chiroptera (19/152). Sequence analyses of a portion of the capsid and premembrane junction revealed that
mammal strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 had only 92.6%, 89%, 95%, and 95.8% identity,
respectively, with strains circulating in the human population during the same periods. Regarding DENV-2,
strains related (99% identity) to those responsible for an epidemic event in humans in French Guiana concur-
rent to the capture sessions were also evidenced, suggesting that wild mammals in edge habitats can be in-
fected by circulating human strains. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that neotropical wild mammals
can be infected with dengue virus. The question of whether mammals maintain DENV in enzootic cycles and
can play a role in its reemergence in human populations remains to be answered.

Introduction

DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) BELONGS to the Flaviviridae familyand has been responsible for major epidemics in the
tropics since the 17th century (Gubler 2001). Its associated
disease manifestations (dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic
fever, and dengue shock syndrome) are caused by four vi-
ral serotypes designated DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and
DENV-4 that are widespread in the tropics throughout the

world with significant public health and economic impacts.
Indeed, with respect to both morbidity and mortality,
dengue is the arbovirus with the highest incidence in hu-
mans (an estimated 80–100 million infections are reported
each year), with exponentially increasing occurrence
(Weaver and Barrett 2004) and expanding distribution
(Solomon and Mallewa 2001). The extent of epidemic events
has been increasing due to several factors: the increase in hu-
man population densities and movements worldwide,

poorly managed urbanization, and less attention paid to the
eradication of domestic and peridomestic Aedes (Stegomyia)
spp. mosquitoes. Up until now, factors regulating dengue
outbreaks have mainly been related to the ecology of vec-
tors, including seasonal variation of densities, relative abun-
dance of infective females, daily survival rates (Kuno 1997),
immune status of human hosts (Halstead 2007), and possi-
bly their genetic background (Rico-Hesse 2003).

Unlike most of the other arboviruses, dengue virus pos-
sesses a unique human-to-human cycle, without the need for
an intermediary wild mammalian reservoir (Rodhain 1991,
Monath 1994). In Africa, Asia, and possibly in the Philip-
pines, the virus nevertheless has, together with the human
urban cycle, a sylvatic cycle, most likely involving nonhu-
man primates as reservoirs (Fagbami et al. 1977, Inoue et al.
2003). Serological investigations in mammals suggest that the
circulation of dengue follows epidemiological patterns, with-
out detectable clinical signs in hosts (Saluzzo et al. 1986a, de
Silva et al. 1999). The oscillating nature of cycles (Diallo et
al. 2003) can suggest that herd immunity of nonhuman pri-
mates and/or possibly other mammalian hosts regulates vi-
ral amplifications, but so far, wild mammals have no dem-
onstrated role in the dengue virus emergence processes in
humans. Indeed, sylvatic dengue strains are genetically and
ecologically distinct from urban ones. Nevertheless, though
epidemic events are induced by nonsylvatic strains (Rico-
Hesse 1990), sylvatic strains can induce characteristic febrile
syndromes in West Africa (Carey et al. 1971, Saluzzo et al.
1986b) and limited epidemics in urban settings (Vasilakis et
al. 2008).

Sylvatic cycles have not been recognized in South America
(Hayes et al. 1996, Scott 2001), in agreement with the supposed
recent introduction of dengue in the New World due to hu-
man population flows during the colonization and slave trade
periods, a scheme supported by both genetic variability
(Gaunt et al. 2001) and historical records (Christie 1881, Stead-
man 1828). Two serological studies in remote forest
Amerindian communities nevertheless led to divergent results
with regard to the potential sylvatic circulation of DENV
(Roberts et al. 1984, Valero et al. 2004). These discrepancies
can be explained by virus divergence that may have led to
technical difficulties in the detection of dengue viral infection
by commonly used serological markers. Investigations on
dengue sylvatic strains in wild mammals have also led to con-
tradictory conclusions. Following the negative results ob-
tained in serological investigations (Rosen 1958, Karesh et al.
1998, Contigiani et al. 2000), other works have shown indirect
evidence of dengue virus infection in mammals. In Central
America, antibodies that neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2
were detected in 20% of tested bats, while in Ecuador 30% of
bats had neutralizing antibodies for DENV-2 and/or DENV-
3 (Platt et al. 2000). In French Guiana, neutralizing antibodies
for DENV-2 virus were also detected in the sera of rodents,
bats, marsupials, ungulates, and xenarthres (de Thoisy et al.
2004). But, because these neutralizing titers were generally
low, they could have been induced by other flaviviruses. Nev-
ertheless, DENV is presumed to make its own antigenic com-
plex within the Flaviviridae (Calisher et al. 1989). On the basis
of these studies, a strictly sylvatic dengue circulation can
therefore not be excluded.

To resolve these questions, we investigated the presence
of dengue virus in wild mammal fauna in areas of French

Guiana, using molecular tools, where dengue is endemic,
with outbreaks of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 reported
since 1991. Only DENV-4 has been detected sporadically
(Dussart et al. 2006). Two distinct sites were targeted. The
first was near the city of Cayenne, where all four dengue
serotypes circulate. There, we monitored fauna over a 6-year
period, during and between dengue epidemics, to gain in-
sights into the susceptibility of free-ranging mammals pres-
ent close to human settlements to infection with DENV and
the possibility that they can maintain a continuous trans-
mission cycle in the wild. A second site was chosen in a rural
location where DENV is practically absent. This area is un-
dergoing rapid development, with the construction of roads
and the establishment of new human settlements. It was thus
of twofold interest. First, it would allow us to investigate po-
tential occurrence of sylvatic circulation. Second, as dengue
emergence events are expected to be related to environ-
mental disturbances, a long-term study site would be valu-
able to evaluate potential movements of DENV from humans
to mammals and conversely.

Materials and Methods

Sites and trapping

French Guiana is a French overseas department on the
northeast coast of the South American continent, between
Brazil and Suriname (4°N 53°W). Ninety percent of its sur-
face area of 89,000 km2 FD is tropical rain forest; the re-
maining 10%, situated in the northern part of the country, is
coastal plain, where 90% of the 200,000 inhabitants live. The
main urban center is Cayenne, with a total of 100,000 in-
habitants. The diurnal temperature in the country varies
from 28°C to 30°C. The dry season occurs from August to
November with a short dry period in March (50 to 150 mm
rain/month) and the rainy season lasts throughout the re-
mainder of the year (200 to 600 mm rain/month).

Animals (bats, terrestrial and arboreal rodents, and mar-
supials) were captured at two different sites. The first, known
as “le Camp du Tigre” (CT), is a secondary forest fragment
of about 100 hectares located in a periurban area near
Cayenne, where dengue is endemic. Seven trapping periods
were implemented: in March 2001, and in the months of May
(rainy season) and October (dry season) 2005, 2006, and 2007.
The site is surrounded by urban areas and has a low diver-
sity of mammalian fauna, including small monkeys (squir-
rel monkeys, golden-handed tamarins), sloths, rodents, mar-
supials, and bats. The second site, “Saint Georges de
l’Oyapock” (SG), is located near the Brazilian border and has
a low human population. This trapping site is located be-
tween the edge of a primary forest and a rural area. Three
trapping periods were carried out there in November 2006
and in June and November 2007.

At each site, 20 to 30 trap stations were used to capture
nonflying mammals. Each station included one Tomahawk
trap (50 � 18 � 18 cm; Tomahawk Live Trap Co., Toma-
hawk, WI) on the ground and 2 BTTm traps (33 � 11 � 10
cm; BTTm, Besançon Trap Service mécanique, France) or one
BTTm and one Sherman trap (23 � 9 � 8 cm; Sherman Trap
Co., Tallahassee, FL), with one trap being placed on the
ground and the other in trees between 1 and 3 m in height.
Traps were baited with apples and/or peanut butter for 15
to 21 consecutive nights and checked every morning. A to-

tal effort of 7257 trap-nights (a trap-night is one trap set for
one night) was carried out between March 2001 and Octo-
ber 2007 at CT and 2822 trap-nights at SG between Novem-
ber 2006 and November 2007. A total of 418 mammals of the
orders Rodentia and Marsupialia were captured at CT, and
46 were captured at SG (Table 1). In addition, 125 and 27
bats representing 14 species were captured at CT and SG, re-
spectively, during the same periods on 2 to 4 consecutive
nights using capture mistnets (12 � 2.40 m, 16-mm mesh; La-
vorazione Reti, Monte Isola, BS Italy).

Captured animals were brought back to the laboratory,
identified using external morphological characteristics (Em-
mons and Feer 1997), and their age and sex were determined.
They were euthanized with pentobarbital (Dolethal©, Véto-
quinol, Lure, France) after chemical anesthesia (ketamine 10
mg/kg � xylazine 1 mg/kg) under veterinary supervision.
Blood and liver samples were collected aseptically and pre-
served at �80°C for later use.

Detection of dengue viral RNA in sera and liver samples
by reverse-transcriptate polymerase chain reaction

RNA was extracted from sera and liver tissues using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, Refrewshire,
UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was re-
verse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer oligonu-
cleotides (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Promega, Madison,
WI). Primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions
were used following Lanciotti et al. (1992). cDNA (4 �L) was
then used for the seminested PCR: During the first run of PCR,
primers D1 and D2 were used to amplify a fragment of 511 bp
corresponding to a portion of the capsid and premembrane
(C/prM) genes. The second amplification run corresponds to
a seminested PCR using primers D1 and TS1-TS2-TS3-TS4.
Each of the last four primers is serotype specific, generating
PCR products of different sizes (482 bp for DENV-1, 119 bp
for DENV-2, 290 bp for DENV-3, and 392 bp for DENV-4). For
each experiment and at every step, all the necessary controls
were carried out to confirm that contamination did not occur.

After serotype identification of positive animals, the first
RT-PCR products were then used for another seminested
PCR amplification using D1 and one of the newly designed
primers to obtain longer amplification products (Table 2). The
amplification was carried out as follows: an initial denatu-
ration at 94°C for 5 min, then 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 52°C
for 90 s, and 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final incubation at
72°C for 10 min. The obtained PCR products were then di-
rectly sequenced using the amplification primers. Sequenc-
ing was carried out with an automatic sequence analyzer
(ABI PRISM 3700, Applera, Courtaboeuf, France) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. DENV PCR products obtained
from humans (CNR des Arbovirus et Virus Influenza, Insti-
tut Pasteur de la Guyane) during contemporary periods were
sequenced using the same primer pairs. Sequences were then
aligned with other previously published sequences of
dengue virus using MEGA software and alignments were
checked manually. Database searches using the BLAST web
server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) were
performed to identify the most closely related strains to those
obtained from wild mammals.

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PAUP*4.0b8

(Swofford 1998). The MODELTEST 3.7 program (Posada and
Crandall 1998) was used to determine the optimal model of
nucleotide evolution for the dataset, which was then applied
for distance and maximum likelihood analyses. The resul-
tant topology was examined by bootstrapping. One thou-
sand iterations were performed for distance analyses and 100
replicates for maximum likelihood analyses. In addition, a
Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1.0 (Ron-
quist and Huelsenbeck 2003) to infer phylogenetic relation-
ships. Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations were run for
1,000,000 generations, with six simultaneous chains, using a
sample frequency of 100 and a burn-in of 100,000. Default
settings for the prior probabilities of the model parameters
(GTR��4) were used.

Results

Detection of dengue virus RNA in mammals

A total of 569 livers and 560 sera collected from 616 cap-
tured mammals were tested for the presence of viral RNA
by RT-PCR. Dengue viral RNA representing the four
serotypes was detected in samples from both collecting sites
for a total of 92 mammals (Table 1). At the CT site, 16%
(87/543) of the animals were infected; the distribution of
DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 at this site was 41% (36/87), 20%, 33%,
and 6% respectively. The distribution of DENV positive
mammals by order was: Chiroptera 4% (19/543), Rodentia
5%, and Marsupialia 7%. At the SG site, only 7% (5/72) of
the mammals, representing a single rodent species
(Proechimys cuvieri) and trapped during a single session, were
positive; they represented the DENV-3 serotype: 4% (3/72)
and the DENV-4 serotype: 3% (2/72).

Sequence analyses and phylogenetic investigations

At least one C/prM sequence was obtained for each
serotype from mammals collected in 2006 and 2007. These
sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession
numbers EU518594–EU518605, EU522110, and EU642553.

One sequence was obtained from DENV-1 RNA detected
in one bat (Carollia perspicillata) captured in May 2007 at CT
(accession number: EU518594). BLAST database searches of
the obtained sequence revealed that the DENV-1 Mochizuki
strain detected in Japan in 1943 is the most closely related
strain with 97.3% identity (419 bp analyzed). Furthermore,
the DENV-1 strain circulating in humans in French Guiana
(EU518605) during the same period presents a lesser degree
of identity (92.6%; Table 3). Phylogenetic analyses show that
the major genotypes of DENV-1 (genotypes IV and V) are
supported with high bootstrap values with the exception of
genotype I (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic reconstruction confirms
that the D1 C0558 bat French Guiana 2007 sequence is closely
related to the Japanese DENV-1 Mochizuchi strain with high
bootstrap values (80% in distance, 64% in maximum likelihood
[ML], 76% in Bayesian analysis) and belongs to genotype I.
In contrast, the DENV-1 strain identified in French Guiana
in the human population at a contemporary period belongs
to genotype V composed of American and Asian strains.

Four sequences were obtained from DENV-2 RNA de-
tected in four mammals captured in 2006 at CT. These se-
quences reveal two distinct groups. The first two sequences
(EU518601 and EU518602) were detected with DENV-2 RNA

identified in two marsupials (Didelphis marsupialis). BLAST
database searches revealed that they share approximately
95% identity (390 bp analyzed) with a strain isolated in In-
dia in 2001 (Table 3). Comparison with a human sequence
obtained in French Guiana during the same period reveals
approximately 89% identity (Table 2). The two other se-
quences (EU518603 and EU518604) were obtained from
DENV-2 RNA detected in two Marmosa murina (Marsupialia)
and are most closely related to a sequence detected in the
Dominican Republic in 2001 with which identities vary be-
tween 99.2 and 99.7%. They are also closely related to the
DENV human sequence obtained in French Guiana at the
same period (98.7 and 99.2% similarity; Table 2).

Phylogenetic analyses performed on these sequences with
other representative strains enabled the five major DENV-2
lineages to be identified on the basis of consistent topologi-
cal associations. Nevertheless, although the Asian, Ameri-
can-Asian, American, and sylvatic lineages are supported
with high bootstrap values, the cosmopolitan lineage is less
supported and divided into two clades that are supported
with high bootstrap values (Fig. 2). The DENV-2 sequences
identified in mammals segregated into two distinct clusters.
Two strains (D2 B1004 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and
D2 B1010 Marsupial French Guiana 2006) were related with
high bootstrap values (81% in distance, 78% in ML, 100% in
Bayesian analysis) to an urban strain circulating in French
Guiana during the same period, and to strains identified in
the Dominican Republic in 2001 (Fig. 2). These sequences are
included in the American-Asian genotype that is well sup-
ported (93% in distance, 96% in ML, 100% in Bayesian anal-
ysis). The two other sequences (D2 B1015 Marsupial French
Guiana 2006 and D2 B1032 Marsupial French Guiana 2006)
are located at the base of the Native American lineage. This
association is also well supported (87% in distance, 69% in
ML, 98% in Bayesian analysis).

Three sequences were obtained from DENV-3 RNA ex-
tracted from three mammals: two in Marmosa murina (Mar-
supialia) captured at CT in October 2006 and 2007 (EU518599
and EU518598, respectively) and one in Procchimys cuvieri
(Rodentia) captured at SG in November 2006 (EU518600).
These three sequences are closely related to each other and
to a strain identified in Brazil in 2002 as well as to the H87
strain isolated in the Philippines in 1956. They show from
99.7 to 100% identity (on a 364 bp fragment) with these se-
quences. Comparison of the three nucleotide sequences with

the nucleotide sequence representing a human DENV-3 iso-
lated in French Guiana during the same period shows ap-
proximately 95% identity (Table 3).

Phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that the three se-
quences detected in mammals (D3 B1018 Marsupial French
Guiana 2006, D3 C1034 Marsupial French Guiana 2007, and
D3 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are related with high
bootstrap values (99% in distance, 97% in ML, 100% in
Bayesian analysis) to strains isolated in the Philippines in
1956, in China in 1980, and in Brazil in 2002. These sequences
cluster together and belong to genotype V (Fig. 3). The hu-
man strain circulating in French Guiana at a contemporary
period belongs to genotype III composed of strains from Cen-
tral and South America, Africa, Asia, and the West Indies
(Fig. 3).

Two sequences were obtained from DENV-4 RNA de-
tected in a marsupial Didelphis marsupialis (EU518596) and a
rodent Procchimys cuvieri (EU518595), which were trapped in
2006. The C/prM sequence is identical to a strain isolated in
2001 in Peru and is closely related to the H241 strain isolated
in 1956 in the Philippines (AY947539) with 99.5% identity
(360 bp analyzed; Table 2). Finally, they share 95.8% iden-
tity with a strain observed in French Guiana (EU522110) in
2005. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that the mam-
malian strains (D4 B1008 Marsupial French Guiana 2006 and
D4 B1106 Rodent French Guiana 2006) are associated with
strains isolated in the Philippines in 1956 and 1995, in Peru
(2001), and in Brazil (2006). This group of sequences belongs
to genotype I, which is not well supported (Fig. 4). In con-
trast, the only DENV-4 strain isolated in humans in French
Guiana in 2005 belongs, together with other South Ameri-
can and West Indian strains, to genotype II.

Discussion

In the New World, unlike in the Old World, the commonly
held belief is that dengue infection is absent in the fauna. Af-
ter recent evidences of positive seroneutralization in wild
fauna, we identified viral RNA in many species of South
American bats, rodents, and marsupials, and we provide the
first C/prM sequences of strains of DENV-1, DENV-2,
DENV-3, and DENV-4 circulating in animal communities.
These results were found repeatedly both in an endemic area
where all four serotypes circulate in the adjacent human pop-
ulations (Fig. 5) and in an area where the disease is nearly

aThe priming position of primer D1 in each genome was as follows: type 1: 132; type 2: 134; type 3: 132; type 4: 137.
The position of each primer (D1L to D4L) is given according to its position in reference sequences (DENV-1: AF226685; DENV-2:

NC_001474; DENV-3: NC_001475; DENV-4: NC_002640)
The size of the amplified RT-PCR product for each serotype using D1 and each specific primer (D1L to D4L) corresponds to the length 

observed between D1 and each primer on its respective genome.

FIG. 1. Phylogenetic Analysis of DENV-1 Isolates. The phylogenetic tree was derived from the partial nucleotide sequences
of the C/prM genes (419 bp excluding primers) of representative strains belonging to the major lineages of DENV-1 (as
designated by Goncalvez et al., 2002) using Distances, Maximum Likelihood (ML) (PAUP, version 4.10), and Bayesian analy-
ses (1,000,000 replicates, MrBayes, version 3.1b). The following ML parameters corresponding to the TrN � G model were
used: Nucleotide frequencies were estimated to be as follows: A � 0.3098, C � 0.1997, G � 0.2389, T � 0.2515. The –lnL
value was 1816.49. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution was estimated to be 0.2005. The tree was rooted on the
strains belonging to genotype IV. Support for nodes was provided by bootstrapping and the posterior probabilities of the
corresponding clades (i.e. 1000 and 100 replicates under distances and ML (in normal and boldface type respectively) and
under Bayesian analyses (in italics and underlined). DENV strains sequenced in this study are shown in boldface.

absent. These findings suggest either spillover infections
from humans to mammals or a possible enzootic cycle in-
volving mammals. DENV sequences obtained from mam-
mals led to the development of two plausible scenarios.

First, on the basis of C/prM sequences, most of the
DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 strains obtained from wild mammals
were divergent from those circulating in the surrounding
human populations during the same periods. The strains
identified in the wild mammalian fauna were found, at dif-

ferent periods, in periurban areas and in forest areas, where
human contacts are limited. This suggests that DENV in-
fection of wild mammals and its circulation in mammal
communities are widespread, which eliminates the possi-
bility that our positive results could be related to inciden-
tal, local, and/or time-restricted epiphenomena. Neverthe-
less, some authors have already recorded such divergent
strains and attributed them to laboratory contamination
(Rico-Hesse 2003). Although laboratory contamination can-

of the C/prM genes (390bp excluding primers) of sylvatic and representative endemic DENV-2 (genotypes designated by
Twiddy et al., 2002) using Distances, Maximum Likelihood (ML) (PAUP, version 4.10), and Bayesian analyses (1,000,000
replicates, MrBayes, version 3.1b). The following ML parameters corresponding to the GTR � G model were used: Nucle-
otide frequencies were estimated to be as follows: A � 0.3249, C � 0.2254, G � 0.2467, T � 0.2030. The –lnL value was
2082.37. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution was estimated to be 0.2596. The tree was rooted on sylvatic strain
sequences. Support for nodes was provided by bootstrapping and the posterior probabilities of the corresponding clades
(i.e. 1000 and 100 replicates under distances and ML (in normal and boldface type respectively) and under Bayesian analy-

ignated by Wittke et al. 2002) using Distances, Maximum Likelihood (ML) (PAUP, version 4.10), and Bayesian analyses
(1,000,000 replicates, MrBayes, version 3.1b). The following ML parameters corresponding to the TIM � G model were used:
Nucleotide frequencies were estimated to be as follows: A � 0.3134, C � 0.2206, G � 0.2354, T � 0.2306. The –lnL value was
1279.91. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution was estimated to be 0.2177. The tree was rooted on the strains be-
longing to genotype II. Support for nodes was provided by bootstrapping and the posterior probabilities of the corre-
sponding clades (i.e. 1000 and 100 replicates under distances and ML (in normal and boldface type respectively) and un-
der Bayesian analyses (in italics and underlined). DENV strains sequenced in this study are shown in boldface.

not be excluded, we considered that this hypothesis bore
little relevance to our work. Indeed, none of the strains
closely related to the ones we identified in the fauna, with
the exception of the H87 DENV-3 strain, have been han-
dled in our institution. Furthermore, viral RNAs were ex-
tracted and amplified right after the collection of the sam-
ples, and the different mammal dengue strains were
identified repeatedly. Our data thus strongly suggest a for-
est circulation of all four serotypes of DENV, but conclu-
sive evidence will only be supported by isolating DENV
from forest-dwelling mosquitoes.

Moreover, although the relatedness of the mammalian
strains to the human ones is only based on a 400 bp anal-
ysis, DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4 strains are related to
Asian strains that were isolated decades ago. The origin of
these strains in South American fauna thus remains highly

questionable. It could be explained either by the history of
dengue dispersal during the 17th and 18th centuries (Due-
nas 1909), or by its introduction by Asian migrants in the
first half of the 20th century (Rico-Hesse 2003). Then, mam-
mals could have maintained these strains and, under the
right conditions (vector pullulation, environmental distur-
bances), these strains could have escaped from mammals
and circulated at low levels among human populations.
For instance, recent DENV-4 strains isolated in humans in
Brazil in 2005 and 2006 cluster with the mammalian strains
we describe here (Pinto de Figueiredo et al. 2008). In the
same way, some DENV-3 strains detected in Brazil in 2002
(EF629370) and during epidemics that occurred there from
2002 to 2004 (Figueiredo et al. 2008) belong to genotype I
and are closely related to the ones we detected in mam-
mals in French Guiana. Nevertheless, considering the lim-

ited size of the sequences analyzed and, despite the fact
that the phylogenetic picture obtained is relevant and con-
gruent, hypotheses on the origins of these mammalian
strains and the possible infection of humans by them have
to be considered with caution. Generating the complete en-
velope gene sequences should enable us to support or re-
fute this scenario.

Secondly, the D2 B1004 20066 and D2 B1010 2006 se-
quences support the notion that fauna can also be infected
by strains circulating in surrounding human populations. In
fact, DENV-2 caused an epidemic in French Guiana from Jan-
uary to September 2006, and the two strains identified in two
Marmosa murina (marsupialia) in October 2006 are related to
the ones responsible for that epidemic. This strongly sug-
gests that under the pressure of a strong epidemic event, ur-
ban strains could enter the forest and then infect the fauna.
Such transmission, facilitated by hunting, logging, or
tourism, has already been suspected with Plasmodium falci-
parum (Volney et al. 2002). Moreover, the vector Aedes (Ste-
gomyia) aegypti, though mainly anthropophilic, can be found
at the edge of forest habitats (Fouque and Carinci 1996) and
could therefore provide a mechanism for virus introduction
in forest animal communities. It thus seems to be of major
importance to consider wildlife species not only as potential
reservoirs for DENV, but also as potential hosts, sensitive to
infection by “human” infectious agents.

On the basis of these results, it is suggested that wild an-
imals could maintain the four DENV serotypes in South

America. Further investigations will have to be conducted to
confirm their potential role as reservoirs and/or as sec-
ondary hosts (Haydon et al. 2002). Actually, all these mam-
malian species can be either an epidemic dead end or can
play a role in maintaining the virus during interepidemic pe-
riods or even in virus amplification. Experimental infections
will therefore be necessary to assess the efficiency of wild
mammals as reservoirs. The ecological dynamics of the mam-
malian species in relation to that of the virus will also need
to be explored. Lastly, extensive research on vectors will be
required. Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti is the vector of DENV in
French Guiana, since Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus is not
recorded in the department. Alhough it is associated with
human settlements, it has also been found in the rainforest
(Fouque et al. 2004) and could therefore be involved in
DENV transmission between humans and mammals and be-
tween mammals. Our preliminary mosquito surveys at CT
revealed relatively low population densities of Aedes spp.,
which raises the question of whether other mosquito species
identified in the area (e.g., Coquilletidia, Culex, etc.) might be
involved in the circulation of the virus among mammals. Ex-
perimental infections have suggested that the role of Culex
mosquitoes may be negligible in DENV transmission
(Vazeille-Falcoz et al. 1999), but extensive vectorial capacity
studies on locally captured mosquitoes will be required.
Once the questions raised above will have been explored, the
results obtained could profoundly modify our vision of the
epidemiology of dengue virus in South America.

Abstract
St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Flavivirus) is a reemerging arbovirus in the southern
cone of South America. In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47

human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood.

Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that

birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence in a

variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and

2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local

ecology of SLEV transmission. BecauseWest Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argen-

tina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled

for detection of SLEV andWNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds

increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion

(99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 out-

break, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV

was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However,

the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of

vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in

2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared

Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV

because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread

abundance. For the same reasons, Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host

for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed

to confirm these relationships.

Introduction
St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is a reemerging arbovirus in the
southern cone of South America (Argentina and Brazil) [1,2]. In 2005, an outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths [1]. SLEV has been
considered a serious public health threat since 1933, when it was first discovered during a large
human encephalitis outbreak that initiated in Missouri, USA [3].

In North America, SLEV is maintained through transmission between Culexmosquito vec-
tors and certain passeriform and columbiform birds. In North America, House Sparrow (Pas-
seridae; Passer domesticus) and House Finch (Fringillidae; Haemorhousmexicanus) are thought
to be principal amplifiers of SLEV in urban locations, with Mourning Dove (Columbidae;
Zenaidamacroura) also contributing in rural regions [3].

In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. The virus has been isolated from
humans (Buenos Aires Province), Culex spp. mosquitoes (Córdoba and Santa Fe provinces)
and wild rodents (Córdoba) [4,5]. SLEV has never been isolated from birds in Argentina. How-
ever, serological evidence indicates frequent infection of SLEV in Argentine birds [6]. In tem-
perate and subtropical regions of Argentina, neutralizing antibodies were detected in a wide
range of birds belonging to several families (Furnariidae, Columbidae, Tyrannidae, Fringillidae,
Icteridae, Ardeidae and Cotingidae) [6].

In 2005, the first human encephalitis outbreak attributed to SLEV outside the USA took
place in Córdoba Province in central Argentina [1], providing an opportunity to characterize
the role of avian hosts in the ecology of SLEV in this locale. Because certain birds are the pri-
mary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as
well. Thus, we should detect a significant increase in viral activity in birds during an epidemic
period compared to an enzootic period. To test this hypothesis, we compared avian SLEV sero-
prevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epi-
demic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand
the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (Flaviviridae; WNV) was also
detected in Argentina in 2005 [7, 8], and is closely related to SLEV, all analyses were also con-
ducted for WNV.

Material and Methods

Study area and collection sites
Bird captures were carried out during summer and fall of 2004 and 2005 in 4 sites located in
Córdoba city (31°24'30”S, 64°11'02”W) (Córdoba Province, Argentina) (Fig 1). This city of 1.3
million inhabitants is situated at 450 m above sea level, and encompasses an area of 576 km2 of
which 37.2% is urbanized. The area belongs to the phytogeographic region called Espinal, Cha-
queño Domain, or “Chaco Thorn-Forest” [9]. This region is characterized by semi-arid thorn
scrub habitat but has been modified intensively by human activities (soy and fruit agriculture,
cattle ranching, industrial activity). Isolated patches of natural habitat surrounding the city are
comprised of shrub forest. The climate is temperate and semi-arid due to high evapotranspira-
tion in spite of a relatively high precipitation level (750–800 mm) [10]. Four sampling sites
were selected based upon accessibility, owners’ authorization and feasibility for mist net use;
most of them are located in the periphery of the city of Córdoba (Fig 1):

1. Bajo Grande (BG) sewage treatment plant (31°23038@ S; 64°04036@W). The site is sur-
rounded by aquatic vegetation, reservoirs, low income human settlements and crop lands
(vegetables and fruits). Vegetation is dominated by non-native chinaberry (Melia azedar-
ach) and white mulberry (Morus alba) deciduous trees alternating with grasslands.

2. Botanical Garden (BT) (31°23013@ S; 64°14058@W). The vegetation is characterized by
patches of aquatic environments, grasslands, croplands and native thorn forest. It is sur-
rounded by low and middle income human settlements.

3. Camino San Carlos (CS) farmland (31°28046@ S; 64°09026@W). Two habitats present include
native thorn forest dominated by Acacia sp., Prosopis sp., as well as cinacina (Parkinsonia
aculeata), and grassland characterized by Poa sp., Stipa sp., Spanish needle (Biden spilosa)
and introduced Chinese privet (Ligustrum lucidum) close to the family house.

4. Villa Gran Parque (VP) (31°19055@ S; 64°10028@W). This vacant lot is surrounded by
human settlements and croplands. The dominant habitat is grassland with Spanish needle,

Sorghum sp., artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) with scat-
tered white mulberry trees.

Permission for sampling work in Bajo Grande and Botanical Garden were obtained from
the Municipality of Córdoba. Private landowner permission was obtained for study sites at
Camino San Carlos and Villa Gran Parque.

Bird captures and sample collection
Birds were captured with mist nets (AFOMist Nets, Manomet, Inc., Manomet, MA, USA).
Four mist nets per site were installed and operated at dawn and late afternoon. The bird cap-
ture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency. Captured birds were
identified, weighed, sexed and aged when possible. Wild birds were marked with uniquely
numbered aluminum leg bands. Before released, blood-sampled birds were rehydrated with
sugar water. Whole blood was collected by jugular (most species) or brachial venipuncture
(columbids). Birds that weighed less than 10 grams were not blood-sampled. Blood was placed
into a centrifuge tube containing 0.45 mL or 0.9 mL (according to blood sample volume: 0.1 ml
or 0.2 ml, respectively) of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) for an approximate 1:10 serum
dilution, held at ambient temperature for 20–30 min for coagulation and placed into coolers.
At the laboratory, samples were centrifuged at 5,000g for 15 min for separation of serum. Sera
were stored at -20°C. Prior to analysis, sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C to
inactivate non-specific inhibitors of virus neutralization.

Ethics Statement
The bird capture was authorized by the Córdoba Province Environmental Agency (586869-
053-107). Birds were handled following guidelines for the use of wild birds in research elabo-
rated by the Ornithological Council (http://naturalhistory.si.edu/BIRDNET/documents/
guidlines/Guidelines_August2010.pdf).

Field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. All blood sampling proce-
dures were specifically approved as part of the obtaining field permit.

Viral stocks preparation
Low-passage SLEV CbaAr-4005 and WNV NY99-4132 strains were used for serologic assays.
CbaAr-4005strain of SLEV was isolated from Culex quinquefasciatusmosquitoes collected in
Córdoba during the human encephalitis outbreak of 2005 [5]. NY99-4132 strain of WNV was
obtained from the brain of an American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) collected in New York
during 1999. Viral stocks were obtained from infected Vero cell monolayers harvested on day 7
and 5 post-inoculation for SLEV and WNV, respectively.

Serological assays and data interpretation
Avian serum samples were screened for the presence of WNV- and SLEV-reactive antibodies
by the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A suspension of approximately 100 pla-
que-forming units (PFU) of virus in 75 μL of MEM was added to an equal volume of diluted
avian serum, bringing the final serum dilution to 1:20. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at
37°C. Vero cell monolayers grown in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA)
were inoculated with 0.1 mL of the serum-virus mixture and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5%
CO2. Cells were overlaid with an initial 1 mL of 0.5% agarose in M-199 medium supplemented
with 350 mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 29.2 mg/L L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin,

streptomycin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B). After 3 and 6 days of incubation with WNV
and SLEV, respectively, cultures were overlaid again with the same nutrient–agarose mix but
also containing 0.004% neutral red for staining and visualization of viral plaques. Plaques were
counted the following day. Serum samples that neutralized> 80% of the challenge virus (rela-
tive to a serum-free control) were selected for further titration against both WNV and SLEV.
Flavivirus titers of serum samples that tested positive in screen tests were determined as fol-
lows. Seven serial two-fold dilutions of serum in MEM were prepared beginning with a dilution
of 1:10. Virus mixtures were added as described above, resulting in final serum dilutions of
1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1280. Endpoint titers were assigned as the reciprocal
of the greatest dilution in which>80% neutralization of the challenge virus was achieved.
Experiments that evaluated cross reaction among SLEV and WNV in heterologous inoculation
scenarios in Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) indicated no cross reaction among SLEV and
WNV (Contigiani MS personal communication).Based on this evidence, plus studies by Patiris
et al. [11] and Ledermann et al. [12], we considered all serum samples with antibody titers
higher than 20 positive. Therefore samples with titers higher than 20 for both viruses were con-
sidered as multiple heterologous infections.

Statistical analysis
Infection prevalence with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for both viruses. Infection
proportions within the year and month of sampling were compared using the Fisher exact test
or Pearson chi-square test. P-values were considered significant at a threshold of α = 0.05. The
homology between spatial activity for SLEV and the bird community was explored by means of
a Procrustes analysis [13]. First, we selected a subset of 6 species that accounted for the majority
of captures (51%) and 70% of SLEV seroprevalence, which included Eared Dove (Zenaida auri-
culata), Picui Ground-Dove (Columbina picui), Rufous Hornero (Furnarius rufus), House
Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Great Kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus) and Bay-winged Cowbird
(Agelaioides badius). These 6 species were represented in all sampled sites. Abundance and
absolute prevalence matrix were built and data exploration showed the need to remove VP
from the dataset (due to double zeros abundance). These frequency matrices were used to pro-
duce unconstrained ordinations analysis with chi-square distance (community assemblage
matrix) and Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (SLEV seroprevalence matrix).
Finally, the ordination configuration homology was estimated by a Procrustes analysis and its
statistical significance was calculated after 9999 permutations [13].

All analyses were run using vegan and core packages within the R platform [14,15,16].
In order to explore the effect of new species detected as infected on the overall avian sero-

prevalence among the study periods, we compared the proportion of infected birds of the
selected species (same subset as used for the spatial analysis) vs. the proportion of infected
birds of the non-selected species, for a given period.

Results
A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV- and WNV-neutralizing antibodies.
Analyzed sera belonged to 65 species and 27 families of free-ranging birds. SLEV seropreva-
lence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005 (Table 1). Although the difference in sero-
prevalence observed between years was significant (Fisher exact test, p<0.001), no significant
difference was detected between months within each year (2004, χ2 = 1.51, df = 3, p = 0.68;
2005, χ2 = 0.44, df = 2, p = 0.80). During January-April 2004 only 3 birds tested positive for
SLEV-neutralizing antibodies (0.7%). SLEV activity was found in 3 resident (i.e. non-migra-
tory) bird species: Rufous Hornero (2.0%, 1/49), Bay-winged Cowbird (8.3%, 1/12) and Great

Kiskadee (1.2%, 1/80). These three seropositive individuals were distributed among three of the
four study sites (Fig 1). One of these (Rufous Hornero) seroconverted from January to March
(Table 2). Of 14 other recaptured birds in 2004, none seroconverted. In the second period (Jan-
uary-March 2005), an overall SLEV seroprevalence of 7.7% (42/543) was registered, with sero-
positive birds detected at all four study sites. Multiple infections for SLEV and WNV were
detected in 6 serum samples (1.1%).Neutralizing antibody titer ranged from 40 to 1280, with
titers of 40 and 160 the most frequently detected. SLEV seroprevalence increased between
years in all three paired-year sites, showing significance differences between 2004 and 2005
(BG: χ2 = 136; p<0.001; CS: χ2 = 58; p = 0.01 and VP: χ2 = 56.35; p = 0.01) (Fig 1). Differences
were also observed among sites within 2005 (χ2 = 24.53; df = 3; p = 0.006).

In 2005, the number of SLEV-seropositive bird species increased from 3 in the previous year
to 15 (Table 3). The avian families with the highest seroprevalence for SLEV-neutralizing anti-
bodies were: Columbidae (14.0%; 14/101); Tyrannidae (10.1%; 14/138); Furnariidae (6.3%; 4/
63); Thraupidae (5.5%; 2/36); Turdidae (4.5%; 1/22); Passeridae (3.9%; 2/51); and Icteridae
(1.7%; 1/59). The seroprevalence by bird species ranged between 0% and 28.6%. Highest values
were observed in Brown Cacholote (Pseudoseisura lophotes, 28.6%; 2/7) and Picui Ground-
Dove (15.4%; 10/65). Two out of 25 recaptured birds seroconverted for SLEV during the Janu-
ary-March 2005 period (Table 2).

Bird community assemblage ordination showed pairwise overlapping (BG-CS, BG-BT)
total inertia 0.62. Two first axes explained 78% of the variation (Fig 2A). Great Kiskadee is a
common element in the BG-CS paired cluster. Picui Ground-Dove, Eared Dove and Bay-
winged Cowbird/House Sparrow abundances are key species in the ordination of CS, BG and
BT respectively. Rufous Hornero was common among all sites analyzed. Two convergent solu-
tions were found after six iterations running NMDS analyses (stress: 0.1267; non-metric fit
R2 = 0.9840; RMSE = 2.77−5). SLEV prevalence ordination shows a complete overlapping
among analyzed sites suggesting a similar composition of infected bird species (Fig 2B). In site
BG, infected individuals of all six selected species were detected. Infected Shiny Cowbird
(Molothrus bonariensis) was only detected here. Sites BT and CS share the absence of infection
in Shiny Cowbird, Eared Dove and Rufous Hornero (Fig 2A). Procrustes test was not signifi-
cant (m2 = 0.7775; t0 = 0.4717; p-value = 0.3456) and failed to detect an association pattern
between SLEV prevalence and bird abundance by sites.

During 2005, whereas the SLEV seroprevalence among birds appeared to be relatively stable,
with no significant change among sampling months, the number of infected bird species
increased throughout the sampling period. Moreover, the relative importance of the 6 selected
species used in the spatial analysis diminished from January to March as more species were

detected as seropositive each month (Fig 3A). The monthly infected bird species richness
increased by 67% from January to March (Fig 3B). Only Picui Ground-Dove, Great Kiskadee
and Eared Dove were detected as seropositive in all three months surveyed in 2005. Picui
Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee together contributed the largest number of infected individ-
uals by month (approximately 50% of all seropositive birds each month).

No WNV-neutralizing antibody was detected during January–April, 2004, among 437 bird
sera analyzed. However, during January–March, 2005, the WNV seroprevalence observed was
1.5% (8/543, binomial 95% CI: 0.6–2.9%). Highest WNVseroprevalence was observed in
March (2.3%; 95%CI = 1.7% - 9.0%;5/125) compared to January (0.9%;95% CI = 0.2% - 4.8%;
1/114) and February (0.5%; 1/209; 95%CI = 0.1% - 2.7%).WNV seropositive birds were
observed in BG (1.3%; 2/160; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.4%), BT (1.1%; 2/176; 95%CI = 0.3% - 4.1%)
and CS (2.0%; 3/151; 95%CI = 0.7% - 5.7%). Only four out of 52 bird species were positive for
WNV-neutralizing antibodies: American Kestrel (Falco sparverius); Rufous Hornero; House
Sparrow; and Great Kiskadee (Table 2). Four WNV seroconversion events were registered out
of 25 opportunities in 2005, most of them in Rufous Hornero (Table 3).

Discussion
Arbovirus activity is influenced in a complex manner by several biological and environmental
factors [17]. As in North America, it appears thatcertain birds play an important role in the
amplification of SLEV during outbreaks of human disease.

Our study indicated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV
infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host popula-
tion was primed to amplify SLEV. Another biologic factor that may have promoted the SLEV
outbreak could be the sustained increase in abundance of the main vector Culex quinquefascia-
tus which has been documented elsewhere [18,19]. In temperate areas, arbovirus transmission
is highly influenced by mosquito vector abundance [20,21]. In urban sites of central Argentina,
SLEV is mainly transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus [22] and potentially also by Culex inter-
for [5]. These mosquitoes’ populations have two annual peaks: a small one in late spring-early
summer (November-December) and a large one in late summer-early fall (February-March)
[18,19]. Based on this vector pattern one would expect the presence of two peaks of SLEV activ-
ity, which indeed was observed during this human encephalitis outbreak [1]. The high avian
SLEV seroprevalence detected in January, followed by no discernable increase in antibody

prevalence during February and March suggests that much of the transmission to birds had
already occurred by January 2005 or earlier, which corresponds with the earlier peak of vector
abundance. Some transmission continued in birds after January as evidenced by two serocon-
version events (Table 3) and an expanding number of seropositive bird species (Fig 3B).

The apparent reduction in avian seroprevalence for SLEV inMarch 2005 can be explained in
several ways: 1. By March, conditions for SLEV amplification among birds were no longer favor-
able, and the detectable seroprevalence dropped as a consequence of normal bird movements (emi-
gration of seropositive individuals and immigration of seronegative individuals from regions where
SLEV was not active); 2. Diminishing detectability of SLEV antibodies as birds aged and their anti-
bodies, derived from infections several months earlier, began to wane to undetectable levels. SLEV
antibodies in some birds infected during December to January could become undetectable in
March due to diminishing neutralizing antibody titers below the detection threshold (20) [23,24].

SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments (urbanized neighborhoods as well as
patches of native habitat) throughout the city of Córdoba, indicating that ecological requirements
for its maintenance are present. However, variation in the force of viral transmission among sites
was observed. The highest activity was registered in the eastern peri-urban site (BG). This area
contains large polluted water reservoirs and trash dumps, which support an abundant population
of Culex quinquefasciatus. These landscape elements agree with those associated with risk of
human infection identified by Vergara Cid et al. [25]. Differences in transmission among sites
would be due to fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts.

Infected bird species found during the SLEV epidemic period belong to the same families
(Columbidae, Furnariidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidae) as those detected during enzootic periods
further north in Argentina [6]. Presumably, a strain of SLEV would utilize similar vector and
vertebrate host species for its maintenance/amplification throughout its geographic range.
Hence, spatiotemporal variation in transmission would result from differing ecological features
such as vector and vertebrate host abundance and distribution, habitat use and population
dynamics. Within the epidemic period, we observed an increase in the number of SLEV-
infected bird species between months (Fig 3). Whether this was due to a change in transmission
ecology (i.e. a shift of transmission to novel amplifier hosts) or spillover to tangential avian
hosts remains unknown. However, infected individuals of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kis-
kadee were reliably present at all sampling sites.

Multivariate analysis used in the geospatial analyses compared the bird species composition
and SLEV seroprevalence among the study sites, but failed to detect a clear separation pattern.
In our study, avian community assemblage varied among sites (Fig 2A) yet SLEV seropreva-
lence ordination overlapped with all sites. The overlapping pattern observed in SLEV seroprev-
alence could be explained by the presence of identical/similar mosquito vector(s) with similar
host preferences. Such was the case for WNV in the eastern USA where viral activity is driven
by mosquito host preference [26]. Although WNV and SLEV share ecological requirements,
this hypothesis must be corroborated for SLEV.

Eared Dove and Picui Ground-Dove (Columbidae), Great Kiskadee (Tyrannidae) and
Brown Cacholote (Furnariidae) had high seroprevalence (>12%), are widely dispersed and are
abundant in several ecosystems (urban and rural habitats). Moreover, seropositive individuals
of Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee were frequently detected during the epidemic

period (Fig 3). These features make these species candidates for amplifying hosts of SLEV.
Experimental infections of adult Eared Dove demonstrated this species’ competence to infect a
local strain of Culex quinquefasciatus with the enzootic 78V-6507 strain of SLEV [27]. Another
interesting species is Rufous Hornero. Although its infection prevalence was low (3.7%), it is
abundant in urban and rural areas. Since it is highly territorial and easy to collect with mist
nets, and it is frequently infected with both SLEV andWNV, it could represent an important
amplifier as well as a good sentinel for flavivirus transmission activity. The House Sparrow is
the main SLEV host in largely urban areas of the USA[3]. However, previous reports from
Argentina highlighted the absence of SLEV-infected House Sparrow (more than 200 sera ana-
lyzed) and questioned its role as amplifying host for SLEV in Argentina [6]. For the first time
in South America, our study detected SLEV-infected individuals of House Sparrow
(seroprevalence<5%). Host competence assays carried out with North American House Spar-
row and SLEV strains isolated in South America suggested a poor amplification potential for
House Sparrow [28,29]. However, without data on host competence derived from infection
studies matching Argentinean strains of SLEV with a sympatric population of House Sparrow,
we cannot speculate regarding its role as an amplifier of SLEV in Argentina.

The first evidence of autochthonous circulation for West Nile virus (WNV) in the American
continent was detected in 1999 in New York City [30]. Thereafter, it rapidly spread throughout
the NewWorld [31,32]. In Argentina this virus caused epizootic events in equines [7]. Molecu-
lar characterization indicated that the introduced strain in Argentina belongs to the I2 lineage
(NY99 strain cluster) [33]. A serosurvey of free-ranging birds indicated widespread transmis-
sion, with no evidence for disease detected in Argentinean birds [8]. The earliest detection of
WNV-neutralizing antibodies in birds from Argentina was January 2005, indicating that WNV
circulation in this country had begun by the end of 2004. In the present study, we document
four birds that seroconverted to WNV sometime between January and March 2005. One of
them was negative in January and had seroconverted to positive 34 days later in February. Host
competence assays carried out in urban birds have indicated that the Picui Ground-Dove is
competent to amplify WNV [34]. However none of 65 representatives of this species was
found to have been infected by WNV in Córdoba.

In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in a
variety of avian species. Seroprevalence combined with avian abundance may be used to iden-
tify candidate amplifier hosts. Competence studies are needed to verify the importance of these
candidates as amplifiers, as well as vector feeding studies to confirm vector-amplifier host con-
tact. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify
SLEV. Rufous Hornero and Brown Cacholote are also frequently infected and may be useful
sentinels because of their local residence, territoriality and ease of capture. Rufous Hornero
may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina.

Abstract

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important arboviral agent causing infections of the central nervous system
in central Europe. Previous studies have shown that TBEV exhibits pronounced genetic variability, which is often correlated
to the geographical origin of TBEV. Genetic variability of TBEV has previously been studied predominantly in rodents and
ticks, while information about the variability in patients is scarce. In order to understand the molecular relationships of TBEV
between natural hosts, vectors and humans, as well as correlation between phylogenetic and geographical clustering,
sequences of TBEV E and NS5 protein genes, were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from TBE-confirmed
patients as well as from rodents and ticks collected from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia. A total of 27 partial E protein
gene sequences representing 15 human, 4 rodent and 8 tick samples and 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences
representing 17 human, 5 rodent and 8 tick samples were obtained. The complete genome sequence of TBEV strain
Ljubljana I was simultaneously obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the E and NS5 protein gene sequences revealed a high
degree of TBEV variability in patients, ticks and rodents. Furthermore, an evident correlation between geographical and
phylogenetic clustering was shown that was independent of the TBEV host. Moreover, we show the presence of a possible
recombination event in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient sample, which was supported with multiple
recombination event detection methods. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed the genetic relationships of
directly sequenced TBEV samples from patients, ticks and rodents and provides the largest set of patient-derived TBEV
sequences up to date. In addition, we have confirmed the geographical clustering of TBEV sequences in Slovenia and have
provided evidence of a possible recombination event in the TBEV genome, obtained from a patient.

Introduction

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important

arboviral agent in central Europe, responsible for thousands of

cases of central nervous system infections every year. TBEV is a

member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [1]. TBEV

genome comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of

approximately 11 kb, which encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved

into three structural and seven non-structural proteins [2].

Phylogenetic analyses of TBEV isolates identified three TBEV

subtypes: European (TBEV-Eu), Far Eastern (TBEV-Fe) and

Siberian (TBEV-Sib) [3]. TBEV is transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks.

Primary vector of the TBEV-Eu subtype strains is Ixodes ricinus.

TBE is maintained in the ecosystem between tick and vertebrate

hosts. The most important vertebrate reservoirs in Europe are

rodents. Rodents serve as both maintaining and amplifying hosts

[1]. Although TBEV viral load is often low or undetectable, they

play an important role in the circulation of the virus in nature as

they enable co-feeding of infected and uninfected ticks [4].

In TBE-endemic areas the virus is distributed patchily in

geographically limited areas, known as TBE-foci [1,5]. Within

such foci, several genetic variants of TBEV have been identified

[6–12]. Furthermore, several studies have identified geographical

clustering of specific TBEV variants within small geographic areas

[6–8]. Gaumann et al. for example performed phylogenetic

analysis of 71 TBEV found in I. ricinus in Switzerland and

identified 10 phylogenetic clades of closely related TBEV, some of

which showed regional clustering [6]. Furthermore, Weidmann et

al. have also identified the presence of several viral variants in ticks

in Czech Republic and Germany. Their analysis also showed

regional clustering of TBEV variants and a correlation between

the genetic and geographic distances of TBEV isolates. They were

thereby able to determine the direction of spread of TBEV in

Central Europe in a westerly direction [7]. These studies were

focused on determination of genetic variability of TBEV in rodents

and ticks, but little is known about genetic variability of TBEV in

patients in endemic areas.

While the incidence of disease has been shown to be correlated

with the regional prevalence of TBEV in ticks and rodents

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48420



[8,13,14] limited information is available on the relatedness of

TBEV strains among different hosts in endemic areas. Durmiši et

al. [8] have shown for example that TBEV is genetically related in

ticks and patients in Slovenia. The aim of our study was to expand

the knowledge about the genetic relatedness of TBEV in rodents,

ticks and patients in Slovenia. Furthermore, we aim to determine

the overall genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia and assess if

there is a correlation between phylogenetic and geographic

clustering of TBEV variants in Slovenia in all three hosts. While

previous studies were focused on molecular determination of virus

isolates, direct sequencing of RT-PCR products was employed in

our study in order to avoid the occurrence of genetic variation due

to virus culturing or cloning. Thereby we were able to obtain a

more realistic view of the genetic variability of TBEV in Slovenia.

We report the largest number of patient-derived TBEV sequences

to date, and show that geographical clustering of TBEV variants is

correlated to the phylogenetic clustering and is independent of the

host. We also provide evidence of a possible recombination event

in the TBEV genome obtained from a patient.

Results

Complete genome sequence of TBEV strain Ljubljana I was

determined and deposited in the GenBank database under

accession number JQ654701. Genome organization analysis of

the 11,092 bp long sequence revealed that it was identical to that

of other members of the TBEV group. Phylogenetic analysis

revealed that strain TBEV Ljubljana I belongs to the TBE-Eu

subtype (Figure 1) and is most closely related to the Central

European TBEV strains Salem and 263 both on the nucleotide

level and the deduced amino acid level (divergence 2.0% and

0.6%). When TBEV strain Ljubljana I complete genome sequence

was compared with 51 complete genomes of TBEV deposited in

GenBank, a total of 7 unique amino acid substitutions were

detected.

A total of 27 partial E protein gene sequences were obtained by

direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from clinical samples of

TBE-confirmed patients, ticks and rodents: 15 from human

samples, 8 from tick samples and 4 from rodent samples. A 757 bp

long segment of the E protein gene was used for phylogenetic

analysis. Nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 95.6 to 100%

(divergence 0–4.4%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level

ranged from 98.4–100% (divergence 0–1.6%). The most promi-

nent amino acid change compared to the TBE-Eu reference strain

Neudörfl was I167V, which was present in all Slovenian

sequences. In addition, a larger part of the E protein gene

(1164 bp) sequence was obtained from 20 samples. A total of 15

amino acid changes were detected compared to the reference

Neudörfl strain. The most prominent amino acid changes

compared to the Neudörfl strain were the same as observed in

the 757 bp long segment. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1164 bp

segment revealed that the 757 bp long segment was equally

informative and therefore the 757 bp segment was used for further

analyses.

A total of 30 partial NS5 protein gene sequences were obtained:

17 from human samples, 8 from tick samples and 5 from rodent

samples. A 933 bp long segment of the NS5 protein gene was used

for phylogenetic analysis. The identity of the determined TBEV

NS5 gene nucleotide sequences ranged from 96.7 to 100%

(divergence 0–3.3%) whereas the identity on the amino acid level

ranged from 97.4–100% (divergence 0–2.6%). A total of 8 amino

acid changes were detected compared to the Neudörfl strain. The

most prominent amino acid changes were V51M and K108R

which were present in all Slovenian sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 757 bp TBEV E gene sequences

revealed that sequences grouped in three major clades (A1–A3)

and four additional minor clades (A4–A7), with high posterior

probabilities (Figure 2). Phylogenetic clustering was independent of

the TBEV host. Namely, TBEV sequences from ticks, rodents and

patients clustered together. Similar results were obtained from the

phylogenetic analysis of the 933 bp long TBEV NS5 protein gene

sequences (Figure 3). Three major and four minor clades were

formed (A1–A7). Sequences that clustered together in the E

protein gene phylogenetic analysis also clustered together in the

NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. The only major exception

was clustering of a TBEV sequence obtained from a patient

sample H-49. While it clustered within clade A1 based on the E

protein gene phylogenetic analysis, it clustered within clade A4

based on the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic analysis. Because the

resulting branch swap could had occurred due to a recombination

event, we addressed this question by analyzing concatenated E and

NS5 protein gene sequences from samples where both were

available (n = 22). Analysis revealed a putative recombination

event in the E protein gene region of sample H-49 including two

parental sequences H-51 (cluster A5) and H-61 (cluster A1). The

recombination event was most strongly supported by the 3Seq

algorithm (average p-value 9.10861024) and less with algorithms
MaxChi (4.62361022), Chimaera (3.40461022) and SiScan
(1.12961022).

To assess potential correlation of sequence divergence to

geographical locations, sample isolation locations were plotted

on the map of Slovenia and colored according to their respective

phylogenetic clustering based on E and NS5 protein gene

sequence analysis (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4, a high level

of regional clustering was present both after E and NS5 protein

gene sequence analysis. Sequences from clades A1 and A3 were

obtained from samples in the northern and central part of Slovenia

while the sequences from clades A2 and A4 were obtained mostly

from the southern part of Slovenia. Some level of regional

clustering was observed also within clades A1, A3 and A2, A4:

sequences from clade A1 being present even more to the north of

Slovenia than the majority of sequences in clade A3 and sequences

from clade A2 being present in the south-western part of Slovenia

and sequences from clade A4 being present in the south-eastern

part of Slovenia. As expected, the largest discordance was

observed for the putatively recombinant sequence from sample

H-49. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between genetic

and geographic distances despite the evident correlation between

geographical and phylogenetic clustering. Therefore, direction of

spread of TBEV in Slovenia could not be determined.

Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the years of

sampling and phylogenetic clustering.

Discussion

The aim of our study was to determine the genetic diversity of

TBEV virus variants present in TBE endemic regions in Slovenia

from human, tick and rodent samples. Nucleotide sequences were

obtained by directly sequencing RT-PCR products from these

samples in an attempt to avoid the occurrence of mutations that

could arise in the process of virus culturing or cloning. To the best

of our knowledge this is the first study that employed direct

determination of nucleotide sequences and simultaneous analysis

of TBEV sequences from three TBEV hosts in one geographical

area. We have shown that sequences from all three analyzed

TBEV hosts cluster together. This observation is in concordance

with the low mutation rate of TBEV and its conservative nature

due to selective pressures implicated by the course of host

switching. These results also imply that a limited number of

genetic changes occur in the course of human infection. With

respect to the quick course of disease and the low mutation rate of

TBEV, these results are expected.

Relatively high genetic variability of Slovenian TBEV was

observed. Seven phylogenetic clades were determined both on the

E and NS5 protein gene sequence analyses. Previous studies of

genetic diversity of TBEV have also shown that multiple sequence

variants are present in relatively small geographical areas. Genetic

variability of the Slovenian TBEV variants is similar to those

reported in previous studies (nucleotide sequence identity 96.1 to

100%) [6,7,10,15,16]. Our results also revealed that TBEV

variants in Slovenia show correlation between geographical and

phylogenetic clustering which is in concordance with previous

reports [8]. Clustering was most evident for sequences in clades A1

and A3, which were obtained in the northern part of Slovenia and

sequences in clades A2 and A4 which were present predominantly

in the southern part of Slovenia. The observed distribution could

be attributed to natural (levels of forestation) and human (freeways

and larger cities) factors that prevent migration of hosts from the

northern to the southern part of Slovenia and vice versa. In a

recent study, Weidmann et al. [7] analyzed TBEV sequences from

ticks in the Czech Republic and Germany, and have shown that

TBEV was spread in the Central Europe from the east to west.

Since in our study no correlation was observed between genetic

and geographical distances we could not assess the direction of

spread of TBEV in Slovenia. Namely, sequences from geograph-

ically related clades did not exhibit higher genetic identities. This

was most profoundly seen in the analysis of clades A1 and A3,

which show greatest genetic divergence but originate from

geographically close locations. These results could indicate that

TBEV was introduced in Slovenia on multiple occasions.

In order to confirm these findings a larger number of TBEV

sequences from the eastern and western part of Slovenia should be

included. Correlation between phylogenetic and geographical

clustering was evident also on a smaller scale. Namely, ticks and

rodents from the same or nearby isolation sites shared a high level

of sequence identity, whereas ticks and rodent from different

locations showed greater sequence divergence. A similar but not as

evident trend was also seen in human samples. Of note, the

phylogeographic analysis of the human samples included the

locations of residency which do not necessarily correlate to the site

of infection. In Slovenia nationwide travel is frequent due to the

short distances and therefore it is not unlikely that patients with

residence in one part of Slovenia got infected in other parts of

Slovenia. On the other hand, despite the frequent migrations a

geographically and phylogenetically well separated cluster of four

patients in the south-eastern part of Slovenia was observed (clade

A4), implying that this variant most likely also circulates in rodents

and ticks in that area.

Of note are also minor clades A5–A7 that were supported by

the analysis of both E and NS5 protein gene sequences, which

reveal an even greater genetic diversity of TBEV in Slovenia. In

order to confirm this observation, further sampling of ticks and

rodents in that area would be necessary.

Analysis also revealed, that the phylogenetic clustering was not

correlated to the year of sampling, therefore a temporal effect of

the observed phylogenetic clustering was excluded.

An interesting finding was the observed differential clustering of

TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences obtained from a patient

sample H-49. E protein gene phylogenetic analysis revealed

clustering in clade A1, while the NS5 protein gene phylogenetic

analysis showed clustering in clade A4. Because, such phylogenetic

jumps often arise due to recombination events, we tested this

hypothesis with several recombination event detection methods.

Analyses confirmed the possible recombination event between a

virus from clade A4 and a virus from clade A1. Because rigorous

contamination control measures were undertaken during this

study, we believe that these results are most reliable. Reports on

recombination in tick-borne viruses are scarce. To best our

knowledge the only reported possible recombination event were

detected by Uzcategui et al. [17] and Yun et al. [18]. Although no

major recombination events were detected in these studies, several

minor recombination events were discovered. In this view, our

study gives the first evidence of possible recombination within

different TBEV variants from patients. Because these results are

preliminary in nature, further sampling of ticks and rodents in

these areas are necessary to gain greater insight into whether the

recombination event is a consequence of a dual infection of the

patient or the recombinant variant is circulating in Slovenia.

In conclusion, our study provides the largest set of patient-

derived TBEV sequences and for the first time compares TBEV

sequences from rodents, ticks and patients from one endemic area.

All sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR

products. Our results show that similar TBEV variants are present

in all three hosts. Furthermore, our analysis revealed relatively

high genetic variability of TBEV and evidence of geographical

clustering of TBEV in Slovenia. In addition, we provide evidence

of a possible recombination event in TBEV genome obtained from

a patient.

Materials and Methods

Samples
TBEV strain Ljubljana I isolated in 1992 from blood of a TBE

patient was used for the completion of the whole genome sequence

[19]. Low-level passage was used for the determination of the

complete genome.

Previously confirmed TBEV RNA-positive samples were

selected from a collection of TBE-confirmed patient, tick and

rodent samples stored at the Laboratory for Diagnosis of Zoonoses

at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology in Ljubljana,

Slovenia. I. ricinus ticks were collected by flagging in TBE-endemic
regions in Slovenia from 2005–2007 and were processed as

described in [8]. Rodents were collected using live traps in years

2007–2008, from TBE-endemic regions in Slovenia, and were

processed as described in [13]. Human serum samples were

collected from year 2000–2010 as a part of routine diagnostic

testing. Since the study was retrospective, informed consent from

the patients was not obtained. Instead, the research was approved

by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of

Slovenia. Also, the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, the

Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, and the

Slovene Code of Medical Deontology were followed in the

conduct of this research. All human samples were anonymized and

no additional sample was taken for the purpose of the study.

Samples were stored at 280uC until further processing.
Sampling locations of tick and rodent samples as well as locations

of residency of patients are shown in Table 1.

Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA from human serum samples was extracted using

TrizolH LS Reagent (Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from homogenized

ticks or mice spleen was extracted using TrizolH Reagent
(Invitrogen Life TechnologiesTM) according to the manufacturer’s

instructions. RNA was stored at 220uC for up to a week or at
280uC for long term storage.

TBEV Real-Time RT-PCR positive samples were included in

this study. Real-Time RT-PCR was performed as previously

described in [20]. Partial TBE E gene was amplified and

sequenced using primer pairs TBE1082 and TBEc2022 [21] or

TBE ENV 3F (59TGA GGG GAA GCC TTC AAT39) and TBE
ENV 3R (59TCA TGT TCA GGC CCA ACC A39). Partial TBE
NS5 gene was amplified and sequenced using primer pairs

TBE7547 and TBEc8732 [21]. RT-PCR was performed using the

SuperScriptH III One-Step RT-PCR System with PlatinumH Taq
High Fidelity (Invitrogen).

Sequencing of PCR products
Amplified PCR products were purified with the WizardH SV

Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Cycle sequencing was

performed using the BigDyeH Terminator 3.1 Cycle sequencing
kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with

the BigDyeH XTerminatorTM Purification kit (Applied Biosystems)
and analyzed with the 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosys-

tems).

DNA sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequences were assembled and cropped to equal

lengths using CLC Main Workbench software (CLC bio, Den-

mark) and were aligned in MEGA version 5 [22] using Muscle

algorithm. For the complete genome analysis of the TBEV

Ljubljana I strain we included in the alignment 52 complete

genome sequences of TBEV representing all three TBEV subtype

groups available. Complete genome sequence of OMSK hemor-

rhagic fever virus was used as an outgroup for the analysis.

Accession numbers of all included sequences are presented in

Figure 1. Nucleotide substitution model was selected based on

Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) in jModelTest, version 0.1.1

[23]. The general time-reversible model with gamma-distributed

rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) was
employed for all phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian phylogenetic

analyses were performed in MrBayes 3.2 [24] and Tracer version

1.5 [25]. Three independent MCMC runs of four chains each

consisting of 10,000,000 generations were run to ensure effective

sample sizes (ESS) of at least 200. Maximum clade credibility trees

were depicted using FigTree version 1.3.1 [25].

Recombination detection
TBEV E and NS5 protein gene sequences (757 bp and 933 bp

in length respectively) which were obtained from the same samples

were concatenated in CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio, Den-

mark). Concatenated sequences were aligned using Muscle

algorithm in MEGA version 5 [22] and analyzed for putative

recombination events using Rdp version 3.44 software (Heath L, et

al 2006). An exploratory search was employed using methods RDP

[26], GENECOV [27], Chimaera [28], MaxChi [29], BootScan

[30], Siscan [31] and 3Seq [32].

Abstract The aim of this review is to present briefly back-
ground information on 27 tick-borne viruses (“tiboviruses”)
that have been detected in Europe, viz flaviviruses tick-
borne encephalitis (TBEV), louping-ill (LIV), Tyuleniy
(TYUV), and Meaban (MEAV); orthobunyaviruses Bahig
(BAHV) and Matruh (MTRV); phleboviruses Grand Arbaud
(GAV), Ponteves (PTVV), Uukuniemi (UUKV), Zaliv
Terpeniya (ZTV), and St. Abb's Head (SAHV); nairoviruses
Soldado (SOLV), Puffin Island (PIV), Avalon (AVAV), Clo
Mor (CMV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV);
bunyavirus Bhanja (BHAV); coltivirus Eyach (EYAV); orbi-
viruses Tribec (TRBV), Okhotskiy (OKHV), Cape Wrath
(CWV), Mykines (MYKV), Tindholmur (TDMV), and Bau-
line (BAUV); two thogotoviruses (Thogoto THOV,
Dhori DHOV); and one asfivirus (African swine fever
virus ASFV). Emphasis is laid on the taxonomic status of
these viruses, range of their ixodid or argasid vectors and
vertebrate hosts, pathogenicity for vertebrates including
humans, and relevance to public health. In general, three
groups of tibovirus diseases can be recognized according to
main clinical symptoms produced: (i) febrile illness—usually
with a rapid onset, fever, sweating, headache, nausea, weak-
ness, myalgia, arthralgia, sometimes polyarthritis and rash; (ii)
the CNS affection—meningitis, meningoencephalitis or en-
cephalomyelitis with pareses, paralysis and other sequelae;
(iii) hemorrhagic disease. Several “European” tiboviruses
cause very serious human (TBEV, CCHFV) or animal (LIV,
ASFV) diseases. Other arboviruses play definite role in hu-
man or animal pathology though the disease is usually either
less serious or infrequently reported (TYUV, BHAV, AVAV,

EYAV, TRBV, DHOV, THOV). The other European arbovi-
ruses are “orphans” without a proven medical or veterinary
significance (BAHV, MTRV, MEAV, GAV, PTVV, ZTV,
SAHV, UUKV, SOLV, PIV, AVAV, CMV, OKHV, CWV,
MYKV, TDMV, BAUV). However, certain arbovirus diseases
of free-living vertebrates (but also those of domestic animals
and even man) may often pass unnoticed or misdiagnosed and
eventually, they might potentially appear as emerging dis-
eases. Active search for new tiboviruses or for new, pathogen-
ic variants of the known tiboviruses in Europe should
therefore continue.

Introduction

Tick-borne viruses (acronym “tiboviruses” might be used,
for short) belong to an ecological group of viruses charac-
terized by their specific biological transmission via compe-
tent hematophagous hard (ixodid) or soft (argasid) ticks

(Ixodidae and Argasidae, respectively) to endotherm
(homeotherm, warm-blooded) vertebrates. Competent vec-
tors are those arthropods that are able to imbibe the virus in
the course of blood-feeding on an infected donor vertebrate
host, to support the multiplication of the virus in their
organism and to deliver a sufficiently large inoculum to
the recipient, uninfected vertebrate host. Usually certain
minimum level of viremia (“infection threshold”) in a donor
vertebrate host is necessary for an efficient infection of
particular arthropod vectors. Therefore, only those verte-
brate species that produce at least moderate viremia have
been regarded as competent, “true” or “amplifying” hosts of
particular arboviruses (Bárdoš 1979). However, co-feeding
ixodid ticks on a viremia-free host can sometimes also
contribute to infection of noninfected ticks (Jones et al.
1987; Alekseev and Chunikhin 1990; Labuda et al. 1993).
Some tiboviruses are transmitted from larvae to nymphs and
imagoes during metamorphosis (transstadial transmission,
TST), from infected female to the offspring (transovarial
transmission, TOT), and from male to female tick during
copulation (venereal or horizontal transmission). These
modes are extremely important ecologically: e.g., under
conditions of TOT, the tick vector also plays the role of a
long-term reservoir of the virus.

In addition to two “major” severe, occasionally
re-emerging virus diseases transmitted by ixodid ticks in
Europe, viz tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hem-
orrhagic fever, there is a number of other, neglected tick-borne
virus infections of vertebrates. They are usually infrequent,
although some of them are probably underdiagnosed, and
other of these tiboviruses are nonpathogenic, or of low path-
ogenicity, for vertebrates (Tables 1 and 2).

This review briefly summarizes present knowledge espe-
cially on the taxonomy, ecology, epidemiology and distri-
bution of European tiboviruses; for related reviews and
additional, more detailed data, see, e.g. Theiler and Downs
(1973), Karabatsos (1985), Málková et al. (1986), Lvov
et al. (1989), Hubálek and Halouzka (1996), Charrel et al.
(2004), Labuda and Nuttall (2004), Gratz (2006), and
Dobler (2010). The virus taxonomy and nomenclature has
been adopted from King et al. (2012).

Family Flaviviridae

Flavivirus of tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV)

There are three recognized TBEV subtypes: (1) Western or
European subtype (TBEV-W), also called Central European
(CEEV—topotype strains are Hypr and Neudoerfl) or some-
times “ricinus” subtype (Clarke 1964; Votyakov et al. 1978;
Rubin and Chumakov 1980; Calisher 1988; Calisher et al.
1989; Gritsun et al. 2003; Lindquist and Vapalahti 2008)—
varieties of this subtype are Spanish sheep encephalitis

(SSE), Turkish sheep encephalitis (TSE) and Greek goat
encephalitis (“Vergina”) viruses; these three varieties are
antigenically more closely related to TBEV-W (CEEV) than
to louping ill virus (Hubálek et al. 1995); (2) (Ural-)Siberian
subtype (TBEV-S: the prototype strains are Aina and Vasil-
chenko), sometimes called “persulcatus” subtype, causing
Russian spring–summer encephalitis (RSSEV:); (3) Far
Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE with prototype strain Sofyin,
isolated from human brain in Khabarovsk, 1937). However,
all three subtypes occur in Europe—the TBEV-S and
TBEV-FE subtypes were recently detected in the Baltic
republics and eastern Finland (Golovljova et al. 2004;
Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). A taxonomic and nomencla-
tural confusion around TBEV has repeatedly been em-
phasized (Clarke 1964; Calisher 1988; Holzmann et al.
1992). In addition, TBEV is very closely related to
louping-ill virus which should be regarded in fact as
the fourth (or, historically, the first) subtype of TBEV
(see below).

History: in Europe, RSSEV subtype of TBEV was first
isolated in the Russian Ural Mts. in 1938 (Chumakov and
Zeitlenok 1939), and CEEV (strain “256”) from Ixodes
ricinus ticks collected near Minsk, Belarus in 1940
(Levkovich and Karpovich 1962; Votyakov et al.
1978). Further isolations of CEEV were reported in
Czechland from human patients and I. ricinus ticks in
1948–1949 (Gallia et al. 1949; Krejčí 1949; Rampas
and Gallia 1949).

Principal arthropod vectors are ticks of the genus Ixodes:
for CEEV I. ricinus (TST, TOT: Benda 1958b; Řeháček
1962; the infection rate may attain 0.5 % to 3 % in valent
natural foci: Grešíková 1972), and Ixodes gibbosus (a vicar-
iant, marginal vector in the Mediterranean). Occasional
vectors are other tick species such as Ixodes hexagonus
(Křivanec et al. 1988), possibly Ixodes arboricola (success-
ful experimental transmission: Lichard and Kožuch 1967),
while only sporadically metastriate tick species Haemaphy-
salis inermis, Haemaphysalis concinna (Riedl et al. 1971;
TOT), Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus,
Dermacentor reticulatus (Georgiev et al. 1971; Kožuch and
Nosek 1971; Naumov et al. 1980; Nosek and Kožuch 1985),
and Hyalomma marginatum (Crimea). Main vector for
RSSEV is Ixodes persulcatus (infection prevalence rates
can reach frequently >2 %; TST, TOT: Chunikhin 1990),
less often Ixodes ovatus, but also Dermacentor silvarum, D.
reticulatus, D. marginatus, H. concinna (TOT), Haemaphy-
salis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis japonica (Naumov
et al. 1980).

Competent vertebrate hosts of TBEV are small forest
mammals, especially rodents and insectivores (Apodemus
flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Myodes glareolus, Myodes

Korvenkontio et al. 1973; Kožuch et al. 1966, 1967a, b;
Kiffner et al. 2011). The role of some forest passerines and
other birds as hosts of TBEV has not yet been fully eluci-
dated; the virus was isolated occasionally from Turdus pila-
ris, Turdus iliacus, other Turdus spp., Corvus monedula,

Troglodytes troglodytes, Accipiter gentilis) in Asian Russia

TBEV causes fatal disease in suckling and adult labora-

(i.c.) but not adult rat (i.c., i.p.), newborn guinea pig (i.c.),
suckling hamster (i.c., i.p.), rhesus monkey (i.c., but not all

1974; Zlotnik et al. 1976; Pogodina et al. 1981, 1986), lamb
and kid (i.c., i.n. but not s.c.). The diffuse meningoenceph-
alitis is characterized by perivascular infiltration, neuronal
degeneration and necrosis, and focal glial proliferation. On
the other hand, no mortality is produced by TBEV in adult
forest rodents Apodemus and Myodes spp. (i.p., s.c.), adult
rabbit (i.c., i.p.). Encephalitis with ataxia, jumping, tremor,
and convulsions can affect lambs, kids or, exceptionally,

dogs (Tipold et al. 1993; Pfeffer and Dobler 2011). CEEV
infection is usually subclinical in adult ruminants and pig;
goats, sheep, and cows excrete virus in the milk (Smoro-
dintsev et al. 1953; van Tongeren 1955; Benda 1958a;
Grešíková 1958a, b). TBEV (especially TBE-S and TBE-
FE virus subtypes) occasionally kills birds of some species,
e.g., C. flammea (long-term viremia and the virus excretion
in droppings up to 11 months was confirmed experimental-
ly), Passer domesticus, and F. atra (van Tongeren 1962;
Hubálek 1994), amphibians Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo
(s.c.).

Natural foci of TBE have been classified (Rosický 1959)
as “theriodic” (situated in deciduous and mixed forest eco-
systems, often game preserves), “boskematic” (pastoral),
mixed “theriodic-boskematic” or “mountain” (Rosický and
Bárdoš 1966; Nosek et al. 1982). Urban foci of CEE have
also been described in Europe (Málková et al. 1983).

There are two basic modes of human infection with
TBEV—by the bite of an infective tick or by consumption
of infected raw (unpasteurized) goat (less often sheep or
cow) milk or dairy products (Smorodintsev et al. 1953;
Grešíková 1972; Grešíková et al. 1975). Whereas the tick-
transmitted cases are sporadic, the milk-borne infections
usually affect whole families or population groups in out-
breaks. For instance, a large milk-borne TBE epidemic
occurred in Rožňava, East Slovakia in 1951, when 660
persons were infected and 274 of them hospitalized (Blaš-
kovič 1954). As much as 76 % of human infections have
been alimentary in Belarus (Ivanova 1984). The virus may
resist in milk at 60°C for more than 10 min and partially
even the pasteurization at 62°C for 20 min, and it is not
inactivated at pH 2.8 within 24 h/4°C. In addition, many
laboratory infections (usually by infectious aerosol) have
been reported in unvaccinated personnel.

Human disease caused by TBEV is meningoencephalitis,
usually with typical biphasic course: the first phase starts
with sudden fever and flu-like symptoms (pronounced head-
ache, general weakness, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia), some-
times conjunctivitis; the second phase appears after an
interval of usually 4–7 days of an apparent recovery, with
affection of the CNS (meningoencephalitis) accompanied
with fever, retrobulbar pain, photophobia, stiff neck, sleep
disorders, excessive sweating, drowsiness, tremors, nystag-
mus, meningeal signs, ataxia, pareses of cranial nerves and
extremities, dizziness, confusion, psychic instability, excit-
ability, anxiety, disorientation, memory loss, and sometimes
personality changes. In the CNS, the virus produces diffuse
degenerative changes of neurons, perivascular lymphocytic
infiltration (“cuffing”) and damage to Purkinje cells. Case
fatality rate in humans ranges from c. 1 % (in TBEV-W), 7–
8 % (in TBEV-S), up to 20–40 % (TBEV-FE); convales-
cence is prolonged, and neurological sequellae (residua)
sometimes including pareses are quite common. Major se-
quelae such as atrophic paralysis of the neck and shoulder
are rare in CEE (Ackermann and Rehse-Küpper 1979; Kunz
1981; Holmgren and Forsgren 1990), whereas they are
relatively frequent and occasionally combined with a chron-
ic and progressive course (e.g., Kozhevnikov's epilepsy,
progressive neuritis of the shoulder plexus, dispersed scle-
rosis, progressive muscle atrophy) in RSSE (TBEV-S:
Zlotnik et al. 1976; Asher 1979; Pogodina et al. 1986;
Gritsun et al. 2003).

Several thousand cases of TBE are recorded in Europe each
year, with considerable inter-annual variation (Korenberg and
Kovalevski 1999; Gritsun et al. 2003; Petri et al. 2010). In
some European countries, TBE is quite frequent: for instance,
on average, 368 cases (140 to 744 in individual years) a year
were reported in Czechland between 1970 and 1999,
corresponding to the incidence of 4.2 (1.4–7.4) per 100,000
inhabitants, and it peaked at 1,029 patients (10.0 per 100,000)

in the year 2006. In the years 2004–2007, only a few countries
have had a higher incidence of TBE than Czech Republic
(5.0–10.0): Slovenia 10.2–18.6, Estonia 10.4–13.5, Lithuania
6.5–13.5, Latvia 6.2–10.8, while the TBE incidence was as
low as 0.6–1.2 in neighboring Austria, due to a much higher
vaccination rate in that country (Mantke et al. 2008).

Diagnosis: serology (ELISA, HIT, CFT, VNT), detection
of IgM in early phase or seroconversion in paired serum
samples; rarely used is the isolation of the virus from the
blood or CSF in cell cultures (e.g., PS pig embryo kidney
cells) or in mice, and detection of the virus RNA by using
RT-PCR.

Therapy: specific immunoglobulins can be applied to
infected persons but they are only effective when inoculated
immediately, i.e., within 1–2 days after infection, otherwise
they could be even detrimental.

Prevention and control include mapping and surveillance
of natural foci of TBE, pasteurization of milk (CEE virus
may persist in some dairy products at +4°C for more than
60 days: Grešíková-Kohútová 1959), protection from tick
exposure (clothing, repellents), vector tick control, and vac-
cination. “FSME-Immun” and “Encepur” vaccines (Loew-
Baselli et al. 2011; Petri et al. 2010) consist of purified
inactivated virus grown in chicken embryo cells produced
by methods largely based on a study of Czech virologists
(Daneš and Benda 1962). A mass vaccination campaign of
Austrian population living in endemic foci led to a signifi-
cant decline of TBE from 612 cases recorded in 1982 to 89
cases diagnosed in 1990 (C. Kunz, pers. comm.), and a
similar 5-to-10 times decrease of TBE incidence has been
reported in other European countries after frequent vaccina-
tion of population.

European distribution: Fig. 1 Outside Europe, TBEV
occurs in the Asian part of Turkey, Asian Russia (Siberia,
Far East), Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
north-eastern China, Japan, and Korean peninsula.

Flavivirus louping ill (LIV)

Synonym: Negishi virus. Prototype strain of LIV is LI-31.
Louping-ill virus is very closely related to TBEV, in fact
indistinguishable from it by conventional serological and
cross-protection tests (Clarke 1962, 1964; Calisher 1988;
Calisher et al. 1989; Kopecký et al. 1991; Shiu et al. 1991;
Holzmann et al. 1992; Venugopal et al. 1992; Hubálek et al.
1995) and with difficulties by nucleotide sequence homology
of the E gene (Gao et al. 1993; Venugopal et al. 1994; Fig. 2 in
Gould et al. 2003, Fig. 3 in Weaver 2006; Grard et al. 2007,
Fig. 1 in Jääskeläinen et al. 2010). LIV is antigenically and
genomically much closer to CEEV than CEEV is related to
RSSEV; LIV should thus not be regarded as a separate virus,
in that RSSEVand CEEVare considered subtypes of one virus
(TBEV). Therefore, Hubálek et al. (1995) and Grard et al.

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 13



(2007) suggested arrangement of LIV as another subtype of
TBEV, and not as a separate virus.

Louping-ill has long been recognized as a disease of sheep
in Scotland. For instance, it was recorded in the 1795 Statis-
tical Account or by Walter Scott in 1891 (Davidson et al.
1991). The virus was first isolated from sheep brain in
Selkirkshire, Scotland in 1929 (prototype strain Moredun
LI-31: Pool et al. 1930) and it is, in fact, the very first
arthropod-borne virus isolated in Europe.

Principal vector of LIV is the tick I. ricinus (MacLeod
and Gordon 1932); LI is also transmissible by the goat and
sheep milk (Reid et al. 1984; Reid and Pow 1985), analog-
ically as the other TBEV subtypes.

Vertebrate hosts are e.g., wood mouse (A. sylvaticus),
common shrew (S. araneus), mountain hare (Lepus
timidus), sheep, and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus:
Reid 1990; Gilbert et al. 2000). LIV infection is fatal to
suckling rat (i.c., i.p.), lamb (i.c., not s.c.), sometimes rhesus

monkey (i.c., i.n.: Zlotnik et al. 1976). No symptoms are
seen in adult M. agrestis (i.c., s.c.), Cervus elaphus (s.c.),
and Capreolus capreolus (s.c.), although meningoencepha-
litis was demonstrated histologically in the deer (Reid et al.
1982), and LIV was isolated from a roe deer (Reid et al.
1976). LIV occasionally affects also cattle, pig (piglets),
goat (kids), horse, dog, hare, and red grouse (with a mortal-
ity rate of 70–80 % especially in juvenile birds: Reid et al.
1978, 1980); interestingly, the grouse chicks die when they
eat infected ticks. Typical course of LI in sheep is biphasic,
with fever and weakness, followed by meningoencephalitis
with cerebellar ataxia, generalized tremor, jumping (to
“loup” means to leap in vernacular Scottish), vigorous kick-
ing, salivation, champing of jaws, progressing to paralysis,
coma and death (lethality 40–60 %). The histopathology
shows (sheep, pig, rhesus monkey, or mouse) a diffuse
meningoencephalitis with perivascular cuffing, neuronal de-
generation, and destruction of Purkinje cells, similar to TBE
(Reid 1990). Concurrent tick-borne fever (Anaplasma phag-
ocytophilum infection) and external stress enhance the dis-
ease course (Reid 1990).

Natural foci of LI are “boskematic” (pastoral: Rosický
1959)—rough, poorly drained hill pastures, heather moor-
lands with bracken and moor-grass; principally a sheep-tick
or sheep-tick-grouse cycle (Reid 1990; Smith and Varma
1981). Unfortunately, spring lambing on hilly pastures coin-
cides with the period of peak seasonal activity of the vector
in endemic foci.

The human illness is usually biphasic; the febrile phase,
after a short period of improvement, is followed by high
fever and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, headache,

weakness, stiff neck, conjunctivitis, retrobulbar pain, pho-
tophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, dysarthria, excessive sweat-
ing, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, drowsiness, confusion,
tremors, nystagmus, and ataxia. Additional symptoms are
similar to that of TBE.

Nineteen naturally acquired human cases and 26 labora-
tory infections with LIV have been described in Great
Britain between 1934 and 1990 (Davidson et al. 1991),
including one fatal encephalitis in a butcher from northern
Scotland (Williams and Thorburn 1962). LIV transmission
to man is obviously infrequent in the U.K. because the
vector ticks only occasionally bite people in endemic areas
(similarly as with Lyme borreliosis). It is primarily an oc-
cupational disease, affecting shepherds, crofters, veterinary
personnel, forestry workers, butchers and laboratory person-
nel. However, human cases of LI with a milder symptom-
atology might remain underreported.

Diagnosis: as for TBE.
TBE vaccine is also protective aginst LIV. Control of

LI is mainly based on vaccination of sheep; the inacti-
vated LI vaccine is commercially available and in gen-
eral use. Tick control by dipping the sheep with residual
acaricides is also practicized. The methods of environ-
mental control of ticks such as pasture rotation, cutting
or burning grass and bush vegetation, and drainage are
effective but economically less feasible (Smith and
Varma 1981).

European distribution: Norway is the only country of the
continental Europe where a typical LIV strain was isolated
(Gao et al. 1993) (Fig. 1). LIV does not occur outside
Europe.

Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV)

Flavivirus Tyuleniy (TYUV) is related to the Australian
Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, VNT and nucleotide sequence
of the envelope gene (Marin et al. 1995), while less similar
to TBEV by CFT and HIT. TYUV is a member of the
Seabird tick-borne virus subgroup of tick-borne flaviviruses.

The virus was first isolated from Ixodes uriae collected in
nesting grounds ofUria aalge on Tyuleniy Island near Sakha-
lin, Sea of Okhotsk (Asian Russia) in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1971),
and simultaneously off the western U.S. coast (Clifford et al.
1971). In Europe, the agent was revealed in fact even earlier—
in 1967 as “Murman” virus under similar conditions on the
Kola Peninsula, northern Russia (Bekleshova et al. 1970).

Principal vector is I. uriae (TST, TOT). Mosquitoes
(Aedes communis, Aedes punctor, Aedes excrucians) may
possibly act as secondary (or mechanical) vectors; success-
ful experimental TYUV transmissions by Aedes aegypti,
Culex pipiens, and Hyalomma asiaticum have been reported
(Lvov and Ilyichev 1979; Lvov et al. 1971, 1973a, b, c, d).

Vertebrate hosts are seabirds U. aalge, Eudyptula minor,
and the suslikCitellus undulatus. Antibodies are often present
in additional seabirds Uria lomvia, Lunda cirrhata, Frater-
cula arctica, Fulmarus glacialis, Phalacrocorax urile, Phala-
crocorax aristotelis, Larus argentatus, Larus fuscus, Larus
marinus, Larus ridibundus, Rissa tridactyla (French coast:
Chastel et al. 1985a, b), and in some mammals (Callorhinus
ursinus, Alopex lagopus, Lutreola lutreola). Antibodies were
detected in 22–33 % of cattle in the N.-European Russian
taiga and tundra zones (Lvov et al. 1989).

Animal disease is unknown, but experimentally inoculat-
ed (i.c. or s.c.) birds show clinical symptoms: encephalitis
with pareses and occasional death in R. tridactyla, L. argen-
tatus, and U. lomvia (Berezina et al. 1974). The virus is not
pathogenic to adult rabbit (i.p.). Febrile illness with adyna-
mia and anorexia was observed in rhesus monkeys infected
aerogenically.

Natural foci of TYUVare seabird colonies on steep rocks.
Three TYUV cases of febrile illness with malaise, laryn-

gitis, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and skin petechiae were
documented in biologists collecting samples in seabird col-
onies in the Murmansk region, 1972–78 (Voinov 1978).

European distribution: Fig. 2 Outside Europe TYUV
occurs in Asian Russia (Far East–Sea of Okhotsk); coastal
West USA (Oregon) and Canada. Migratory seabirds play a
role in the exchange of TYUV complex flaviviruses be-
tween the northern and southern hemispheres (Lvov and
Ilyichev 1979).

Flavivirus Meaban (MEAV)

MEAV is a member of the Seabird tick-borne virus sub-
group of tick-borne flaviviruses, Tyuleniy antigenic

complex (Calisher et al. 1989). Prototype: Brest/Ar/T707
(Ornithodoros maritimus, France, 1981). Closely related to
the Australian Saumarez Reef virus by CFT, HIT and even
VNT (Chastel et al. 1985a, b), while more distantly related
to TYUV (unrelated by VNT), TBEVand other flaviviruses.

First isolated from argasid ticks collected in seagull col-
onies on Méaban and Penfred islands, Brittany (France) in
1981–82 (Chastel et al. 1985a, b).

Principal vector is the soft tick O. maritimus (TST).
Vertebrate hosts are unknown, but antibodies have been

detected in gulls L. argentatus and L. fuscus. Meningoen-
cephalitis in suckling mouse caused by MEAV is character-
ized by perivascular cuffing and diffuse neuronal necrosis
(Chastel et al. 1985a, b).

Natural foci of MEAVoccur in seabird colonies.
Animal and human disease caused by MEAV has not been

reported, and no antibodies toMEAVwere detected by HIT in
562 human sera collected in Brittany (Chastel et al. 1985a, b).

European distribution: Fig. 2 Long-distance migratory
Sterna paradisaea and Sterna hirundo terns could have

viruses or their common progenitor between Australia and
France (Chastel et al. 1985a, b).

Orthobunyavirus Bahig (BAHV)

Tete antigenic group. Prototype: EgB-90 (Oriolus oriolus
blood, Egypt, 1966). European topotype: ISS.U.45 (F. mon-
tifringilla blood, Italy, 1968). Related to Matruh virus by
CFT and HIT (indistinguishable by CFT), less to Tete virus.

Originally isolated from the blood of O. oriolus caught at
Bahig village near Alexandria, Egypt, in 1966 (Watson et al.
1972). In Europe, first reported from migrating birds in N.
Italy (Balducci et al. 1973).

Arthropod vector is H. marginatum (TOT).
Vertebrate hosts are passerine birds of the genera Oriolus,

Muscicapa, Sylvia, Phylloscopus, Phoenicurus, Luscinia,
Chloris, and Fringilla (Balducci et al. 1973; Watson et al.
1972).

Human and animal disease caused by this virus has not
been reported.

European distribution: central and northern Italy. Outside
Europe: Egypt, Cyprus. BAHV was isolated from larval H.
marginatum rufipes collected on a northward migrating
Oenanthe oenanthe in Egypt (Converse et al. 1974) which
indicates a possible means of dispersal.

Orthobunyavirus Matruh (MTRV)

Tete antigenic group. Prototype: EgAn 1047–61 (Sylvia
curruca blood, Egypt, 1961). European topotype: ISS.U.60

16 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36



(F. coelebs blood, Italy, 1968). Related to BAHV by CFT
and HIT.

The virus was first isolated by J.R. Schmidt from migrat-
ing passerines in Burg el Arab, Matruh Governorate, Egypt,
1961 (Theiler and Downs 1973). In Europe, it was recov-
ered from migrating birds in North Italy (Balducci et al.
1973).

Arthropod vector is probably H. marginatum.
Vertebrate hosts are passerine birds of the genera Phyllo-

scopus, Sylvia, Saxicola, Phoenicurus, Luscinia, Lanius,
Serinus, Carduelis and Fringilla (Italy: Balducci et al.
1973), and C. coturnix.

Human and animal disease caused by this virus has not
been reported.

European distribution: northern Italy. Outside Europe:
Egypt, Cyprus.

Phlebovirus Grand Arbaud (GAV), Phlebovirus Ponteves
(PTVV)

Uukuniemi antigenic group. GAV prototype: Argas-2
(Argas reflexus, Camargue, France, 1966). PTVV prototype:
Larves-6 (A. reflexus, France, 1966). Both viruses are relat-
ed, producing one-way reaction in cross-CFT. Also related
to UUKV by CFT.

The viruses were isolated only once from argasid ticks
collected in a pigeon house in South France, 1966 (Hannoun
et al. 1970).

Arthropod vector is A. reflexus (TST, TOT in PTVV).
Vertebrate host is probably pigeon.
Animal and human disease caused by either GAV or

PTVV has not been reported.
European distribution: Fig. 3. Outside Europe: unknown.

Phlebovirus Uukuniemi (UUKV)

Uukuniemi antigenic group. Synonyms: Poteplí virus;
Sumakh virus. Prototype: S-23 (I. ricinus, Finland, 1960).
Topotypes: Poteplí PO-63 (I. ricinus, Bohemia, 1963),
Sumakh (Turdus merula heart and lungs, Azerbaijan,
1968). Hemagglutinin is produced, but not readily in all
strains.

The virus was originally isolated from I. ricinus collected
from cattle at Uukuniemi, southeast Finland in 1959
(Oker-Blom et al. 1964), later (1963) in Central Bohemia
as “Poteplí” virus (Kolman et al. 1966).

Arthropod vectors are the ticks I. ricinus (TST, TOT:
Samoilova and Voinov 1980), less commonly I. persulcatus.
The virus was also isolated occasionally from mosquitoes
Culex modestus, Aedes vexans, A. punctor, A. communis and
Aedes cataphylla (Lvov et al. 1987, 1989; Vinograd et al.
1971)—but mosquitoes are obviously only mechanical
vectors.

Vertebrate hosts are forest rodents (Myodes glareolus,
A. flavicollis: Kožuch et al. 1970a, b; Wróblewska-
Mularczykowa et al. 1970; Vinograd et al. 1981) and birds,
largely ground-feeding passerines (T. merula, Turdus philo-
melos, T. iliacus, T. pilaris, Erithacus rubecula, Prunella
modularis, Sylvia communis, O. oenanthe, S. vulgaris, C.
corone, P. pica, F. coelebs, Coccothraustes coccothraustes,
Emberiza citrinella, Streptopelia turtur, and Phasianus col-
chicus: Gaidamovich et al. 1971; Hubálek 1994; Lvov and
Ilyichev 1979; Saikku 1974; Saikku and Brummer-
Korvenkontio 1973; Vasilenko et al. 1975a, b; Vinograd
et al. 1971, 1975). Viremia and long-term persistence of the
virus was demonstrated in experimentally infected birds of
many species. Antibodies were also detected in cows and
reptiles. Fatal meningoencephalitis with myositis occurs in
suckling mouse but no symptoms are observed in adult mouse
(any route incl. s.c., i.n.) or adult rat (i.c.); also pathogenic to
suckling but not adultM. arvalis, A. flavicollis orM. glareolus
(i.c., usually not i.p.: Kožuch et al. 1970a, b) and suckling rat
(i.c., not i.p.), and non-pathogenic for rhesus monkey inocu-
lated i.p. (but lymphocytic meningitis appeared when UUKV
was given i.c.: Grešíková et al. 1970).

Animal and human disease caused by UUKV has not
been reported. Antibodies were detected infrequently (≤5 %
persons examined) in a few areas (Kolman et al. 1973;
Málková et al. 1980; Molnár et al. 1976; Sekeyová et al.
1970; Vasilenko et al. 1975a, b) while only exceptionally at
a higher frequency (e.g., 13–14 % in western Belarus and
Hungary: Voinov 1978; Molnár et al. 1980), and much more
often these serosurveys for UUKV were negative.

European distribution: Fig. 3. Outside Europe:
Azerbaijan, Asian Russia. Antibodies in Tunisia. Migra-
tory birds play a role in the widespread distribution of
UUKV; e.g., several strains of the virus have been
isolated from immature I. ricinus collected on migratory
passerines (Traavik 1979).

Phlebovirus Zaliv Terpeniya (ZTV)

Uukuniemi antigenic group. Prototype: LEIV-21C. Distantly
related to UUK virus by CFT.

Originally isolated from adult I. uriae collected in rocky
breeding grounds of marine birds (U. aalge etc.) on Tyuleniy
Island (Sakhalin region) and Commodore Islands (Kamchatka
region), Russia in 1969 (Lvov et al. 1973a, b, c, d). In Europe,
first isolated under similar conditions in theMurmansk region,
North Russia in 1970 (Lvov et al. 1973a, b, c, d, 1989).

Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST, TOT), rarely I.
signatus. Occasional isolations from Ae. communis mosqui-
toes in N.-European tundra (Lvov et al. 1987, 1989).

Vertebrate hosts are U. lomvia, R. tridactyla. Antibodies
were also detected in L. marinus and U. aalge. Some

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 17



mortality (acute viral encephalitis) has been observed in
chickens inoculated i.c. or s.c. (Chastel 1988).

Animal and human disease caused by ZTV has not been
reported. Antibodies rarely occur in farmers who have lived
near Cap Sizun (Chastel 1988).

European distribution: Fig. 4. Outside Europe: E. and N.
Asian Russia (Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Taimyr), NW. Canada
and USA.

Phlebovirus St. Abb's Head (SAHV)

Uukuniemi antigenic group. A non-registered virus (isolates
GM710 and M349) that involves a number of closely related
(SAHV-like) strains. Prototype: M-349 (I. uriae, North
Scotland, 1979).

First isolated from adult I. uriae and the blood and organs
of moribund juvenile kittiwakes (R. tridactyla) collected on
breeding grounds off N. Scotland, 1979 (Nuttall et al. 1981)
and NE. England (Eley and Nuttall 1984).

Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST) and I. rothschildi
(Nuttall et al. 1984a).

Main vertebrate host is kittiwake R. tridactyla. An illness in
juvenile kittiwakes has repeatedly been observed. Antibodies
have also been detected in U. aalge, Alca torda, and other
marine birds (Nuttall 1984; Nuttall et al. 1984a). A relatively
low mortality of suckling mice was observed at i.c. inocula-
tion (Nuttall et al. 1984b; Moss and Nuttall 1985).

Human disease caused by SAHV has not been reported.
European distribution: Fig. 4.
Labuda and Nuttall (2004) list a number of additional

uukuvirus-like isolates from I. uriae ticks collected from

European colonial seabird habitats, that may belong either
to SAHVor ZTV, or some of them possibly to a novel virus:
Arbroath ARB2, (Scotland), Ellidaey ELL-1,-2,-4 (Iceland),
Flatholm (Iceland), Foula F89-1 (Shetland Islands), Great
Saltee Island GS80-4,-10,-11 (SE. Ireland), Isle of May
M320/79, M326/79, M34-81, M35-81 (Scotland), Marsden
(England), Rost Islands NorV-697,-707,-820-868 (Norway),
Runde Island Ru E82 (Norway), Soay (Scotland–St. Kilda).

Nairovirus Soldado (SOLV)

Hughes antigenic group. Prototype: TRVL-52214
(Ornithodoros capensis/denmarki, Trinidad, 1963).
European topotypes: EgAr-3608 (O. maritimus, N.
Wales, 1974) and Brest-Ar/T13 (O. maritimus, France,
1977). A remarkable antigenic heterogeneity of SOLV
isolates has been found by CFT; in fact, some European
(French, Irish) isolates differ from the prototype strain more
than eightfold in reciprocal titres (Chastel et al. 1983). SOLV
is distantly related to Zirqa and Punta Salinas viruses of the
Hughes serogroup by CFT, VNT, and IFA (Converse et al.
1976; Yunker et al. 1977). The virus is very stable at pH 3.

SOLV was originally isolated from mixed nymphal O.
capensis and O. denmarki ticks infesting Anous stolidus
colonies on Soldado Rock near Trinidad, 1963 (Jonkers
et al. 1973). In Europe, it was recovered from O. maritimus
infesting L. argentatus nests on Puffin Island (N. Wales:
Converse et al. 1976), Ireland (Keirans et al. 1976), England
(Nuttall et al. 1986), and Cap Fréhel and Cap Sizun
(Brittany, France: Chastel et al. 1979, 1981a, b, 1988a,
b; Quillien et al. 1986).

Zaliv Terpeniya (circles) and St.
Abb's Head (squares) viruses

18 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36



Arthropod vector is O. maritimus (TST; the mean infec-
tion rate of vector ticks can be as high as 20 %: Johnson et
al. 1979) in Europe, while O. capensis elsewhere.

Vertebrate hosts are seabirds Sterna fuscata, L. argenta-
tus, and R. tridactyla (Chastel et al. 1990). Antibodies were
also detected in Larus cachinnans, Larus cirrhocephalus,
Phalacrocorax aristotelis, and other species. Mortality due
to SOLV was observed in young seabirds such as S. fuscata
or L. argentatus (Converse et al. 1975; Chastel et al. 1990).
Infected O. capensis have transmitted the virus to domestic
chicks and caused their death on days 5 to 8 post-feeding
(Converse et al. 1975).

Natural foci are seabird colonies (usually on rocky off-
shore islands).

Ornithologists bitten by O. capensis in the Seychelles
experienced severe pruritus persisting for a few days
(Converse et al. 1975); the etiology has remained unclear
in that a possible cutaneous reaction to tick bites could not
be excluded. A case of febrile illness with persistent rhino-
pharyngitis and pruritus due to SOLV was observed in a
scientist who had been repeatedly bitten by O. maritimus in
Morocco (Chastel et al. 1981a, b). However, antibodies
rarely occur in farmers who live near Cap Sizun (Chastel
1988). The related Zirqa and Punta Salinas viruses may
cause fever with headache, pruritus, and erythema in people
in the Arabian Gulf and Peru, respectively (Converse et al.
1975, 1976).

European distribution: Fig. 5. Outside Europe: Trinidad,
Ethiopia, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Morocco, USA
(Hawaii, Texas). Seabird migrations account for the

widespread distribution of SOLV (Converse et al. 1975). A
number of additional Hughes group SOLV-like isolates from
I. uriae ticks collected from European colonial seabird hab-
itats were reported (Labuda and Nuttall 2004): Ellidaey
ELL81-3b (Iceland), Foule F80-1 (Shetland Islands), Great
Saltee 59972, GS80-3 (Ireland), Grimsey G82-1b (Iceland),
Inner Farne IF80-3,-4 (England), Isle of May (Scotland).

Nairovirus Puffin Island (PIV)

Hughes antigenic group. Prototype: 9617 (O. maritimus,
Wales, 1974); other similar isolates are EgArt 608, 3615,
3616 (Wales), and Petticko Wick (Scotland: Labuda and
Nuttall 2004). A non-registered virus composed of strains
closely related to SOLV but distinguishable by IFA and
VNT (Gould et al. 1983). The virus is very sensitive at
pH 3.

PIV was first isolated from argasid ticks collected in L.
argentatus nests on Puffin Island, N. Wales in 1974 and
originally referred to as SOLV, but re-identified as a new
virus later (Gould et al. 1983).

Arthropod vector is O. maritimus, but several Icelandic
and British isolates have been recovered also from I. uriae.

Vertebrate hosts are L. argentatus and F. arctica. Anti-
bodies were also detected in U. aalge, A. torda, and other
seabirds.

Animal and human disease caused by PIV has not been
reported.

European distribution: Fig. 5 In addition, antigenically
closely related virus strains were isolated in Ireland (GS-80-3:

Nuttall et al. 1984a), Britain (Nuttall et al. 1986) and Iceland
(GRIMS82-1b, ELL-3b: Moss et al. 1986).

Nairovirus Avalon (AVAV)

Sakhalin antigenic group. Synonym: Paramushir virus. Dis-
tantly related to Sakhalin virus (SAKV) by CFT (Main et al.
1976a, b). Prototype: CanAr-173 (I. uriae, Newfoundland,
1972). Topotype: LEIV-2268Ku (“Paramushir”: I. signatus,
Paramushir Island, Far East, 1969).

First isolated from engorged adult and nymphal I. uriae
collected in a L. argentatus nest on Great Island, Newfound-
land, Canada in 1972 (Main et al. 1976a, b). “Paramushir”
virus was isolated from I. uriae and I. signatus collected
from seabird colonies in the Far East in fact earlier, in 1969
(Lvov et al. 1976). In Europe, several strains of AVAV were
isolated from I. uriae collected in Cap Sizun, Brittany,
France in 1979 (Chastel et al. 1981a, b; Quillien et al. 1986).

The virus is stable at pH 3, but some strains might be acid
labile (Quillien et al. 1986); heat sensitive (inactivated at 56°C
within 30 m).

Arthropod vectors are I. uriae (TST) and I. signatus.
The vertebrate host is L. argentatus (Main et al. 1976a, b).

Antibodies were also detected in F. arctica, Oceanodroma
leucorrhoa, Larus marinus. Spontaneous animal disease is
unknown. Although fatal to suckling mouse (i.c.), the survival
is long and the titres in suckling mouse brain are rather low.

Natural foci are seabird colonies on cliffs.
Three human cases of cervical adenopathy were

described in France (Chastel 1985). However, antibodies
in humans occur rarely: only 1 % of farmers who had lived
near Cap Sizun were seropositive (Quillien et al. 1986).

European distribution: Fig. 6. Outside Europe: Asian
Russia (Far East), Canada.

Nairovirus Clo Mor (CMV)

Sakhalin antigenic group. Prototype: ScotAr-7 (I. uriae,
Scotland, 1973). Closely related to SAKV (prototype
LEIV-71c: I. uriae, Far East, 1970–Lvov et al. 1972), the
difference in titres being only three to fourfold in cross-CFT
(Main et al. 1976a, b). CMV may be regarded as a subtype
of SAKV.

First isolated from engorged nymphal I. uriae collected in
a U. aalge colony at Clo Mor, Cape Wrath, Scotland in 1973
(Main et al. 1976a, b).

The virus is very stable at pH 3 (>3 h at 4°C). HA is
occasionally produced in suckling mouse brain.

Arthropod vector is I. uriae (TOT: Lvov et al. 1972).
Vertebrate hosts are unknown (possibly seabirds, but

antibodies have not yet been detected in them). Fatal to
suckling mouse (s.c.) but not to adult mouse (s.c.) or chicks
(i.c.). Suckling mice are relatively insensitive for the

isolation attempts (Nuttall et al. 1984b). Moreover, CMV
is poorly immunogenic in mouse at i.p. or i.c. inoculation.

Human disease caused by CMV has not been reported;
no antibodies have been detected in humans.

European distribution: Fig. 6. Outside Europe: Asian
Russia (northern Far East). Two strains similar to CMV
were reported (Labuda and Nuttall 2004) from I. uriae ticks
in seabird colonies: Old Copper Mine (England–Lundy) and
Shiant Islands M325 isolate (Scotland).

Nairovirus of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV)

Synonyms: Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CHF) virus; Congo
(CON) virus. Prototype: Khodzha (human blood from a fatal
case, Uzbekistan, 1967). African topotype: V-3011 (human
blood, Zaire, 1956–registered in 1969). European topotype:
Drozdov (human blood, southern Russia, 1967).

The disease (hemorrhagic fever) was first mentioned by
Tadjik physician Abu-Ibrahim Djurdjani in the 12th century
(Shapiro and Barkaghan 1960). It has been extensively
studied since the 1944/45 epidemic (more than 200 human
cases, c. 10 % were fatal) in the Crimean peninsula and
called “Crimean hemorrhagic fever”. Mikhail P. Chumakov
and co-workers demonstrated viral etiology of the disease
by experimental infection of a volunteer with an ultrafiltrate
of homogenized nymphal H. marginatum ticks collected
from local hares in 1945 (Chumakov 1974). CHF virus
was first isolated from patients in Astrakhan, Rostov and
Uzbekistan in 1967 (Butenko et al. 1968; Chumakov et al.
1971), and from ticks in Crimea in 1972–73 (Chumakov
1974), while CON virus was recovered earlier by G. Cour-
tois from a patient in Zaire (Congo) in 1956 (Simpson et al.
1967). It was recognized that CONV is identical to CHFV
(Casals 1969), and Harry Hoogstraal proposed the com-
bined name of the virus and disease–CCHF (Hoogstraal
1979).

Arthropod vectors (and also a reservoir of CCHFV) are
metastriate ixodid ticks—H. marginatum (TST, TOT), H.
rufipes (TOT, Africa), H. turanicum (Asia), H. truncatum
(TST, TOT), H. asiaticum, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. exca-
vatum, H. detritum, H. nitidum, H. impeltatum, H. impres-
sum, H. lusitanicum (Spain), H. punctata (Europe),
Rhipicephalus bursa (Europe), R. sanguineus (Europe), R.
rossicus (South Russia, TOT: Kondratenko 1976), R. pum-
ilio, R. pulchellus, R. turanicus, D. marginatus (Europe,
TOT: Kondratenko 1976), D. daghestanicus, Amblyomma
variegatum, Boophilus annulatus (syn. B. calcaratus:
Bulgaria, Russia), B. decoloratus and B. microplus
(Pakistan). Much less frequent vectors are prostriate ticks
(subfamily Ixodinae): I. ricinus (few CCHFV isolations in
Crimea, Moldavia, Bulgaria and Hungary). Occasional vectors
outside Europe can be soft ticks Argas persicus (Uzbekistan)
and Ornithodoros (Alveonasus) lahorensis (Iran).

20 Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36



Vertebrate hosts are leporids, hedgehog, other small
mammals, cattle, horse, goat, sheep. There is inapparent
course of the CCHF infection in mammals, and birds are
refractory to experimental infection. Fatal to suckling rat
(i.c. but not i.p.) and newborn cotton rat (i.c., i.p.). No
mortality in adult rat (i.p., s.c.), rabbit (i.p., s.c.; some
symptoms after i.c.), hare Lepus europaeus (i.v., s.c.), Cit-
ellus pygmaeus (i.c., s.c.), rhesus monkey i.p. (rash only),
sheep (s.c., i.p.), calf (i.v.), donkey and horse (i.v., s.c.).
Plaques (and/or indistinct CPE) produced in primary
Cercopithecus kidney cells. Usually no multiplication
in BSC-1, HEp-2, and primary mouse embryo
(David-West 1971, 1972).

Natural foci of CCHF are typically xerothermic, mostly
open habitats with shrub and dispersed or solitary trees.

CCHF is transmitted mostly by bite of an infective tick,
at removal of feeding ticks, but also during shearing of
sheep with attached infectious ticks, slaughtering of infected
animals (livestock-to-human transmission), or by direct con-
tact with a human patient, e.g., at nursing and care for
patients (human-to-human transmission). CCHF is highly
contagious, and many hospital, household and laboratory
infections (including fatal) have been described. For in-
stance, 6 % of the human CCHF cases recorded in Bulgaria
were nosocomial. A much greater proportion of nosocomial
and family infections occur in the Middle East, Central
Asia, and Pakistan, usually with a high mortality rate
(Hoogstraal 1979). CCHF may be an occupational dis-
ease in cattle breeders, butchers, livestock industry,
health professionals (nosocomial spread), laboratory
workers (aerosol).

Human disease: CCHF is characterized by an abrupt
onset with fever (3–16 days, often biphasic), chills, general
weakness, severe headache, myalgia, neckache, back pains,
generalized arthralgia, hyperemia of the face, neck and
chest, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, abdominal and epigastric
pains, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, stiffness, diarrhea, pho-
tophobia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, dizzi-
ness, psychotic signs (depression, sleepiness, lassitude),
bradycardia, hemorrhagic manifestations (from petechial
rash on the trunk to large hematomas on the mucous mem-
branes and skin, bleeding from mucous membranes—gums,
nose, intestine and lungs or kidney; sometimes bleeding into
brain), liver failure, pulmonary failure, hemorrhagic shock.
Laboratory findings include increased levels of transami-
nases, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
Long convalescence (common problems are asthenia, hair
loss, rapid fatigability, sweating, headache, poor vision and
hearing), but without residua. Fatality rate is 3–30 % (but in
nosocomial infections up to 50 %).

In south-eastern Europe, several outbreaks of CCHF have
been recorded since the 1950s: e.g., 1,568 cases were noti-
fied in Bulgaria from 1953 to 2008, with a mean fatality rate
of 17 %. Since 1999 (but especially in 2006–07), a reacti-
vation of natural foci and re-emergence of CCHF occurred
in Kosovo (119 cases during 1995–2001), southern Russia
(regions Stavropol, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, Kalmy-
kia, Dagestan:—a total of >1,300 patients were diagnosed
with CCHF from 1999 until 2007, the fatality rate being
3–5 %. Albania reported eight CCHF cases in 2001, addi-
tional cases in 2003–2006. A surprising, continuous epi-
demic process started in the Asian part of Turkey in 2002,

Fig. 6 European distribution of
Avalon (circles) and Clo Mor
(asterisks) nairoviruses

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 21



and until 2009, a total of 4,430 human cases were reported
from 680 settlements mainly in the Tokat and Sivas prov-
inces (but as many as 2,615 cases were notified solely in the
last 2 years 2008 and 2009), with a mean overall fatality rate
of 5 %; in addition, 16 % of healthy population have anti-
bodies to CCHF virus in Turkey at present (most often
farmers and village residents). This exceptional epidemio-
logical upsurge of CCHF in Turkey (largely in north-east
Anatolia in the Asian part of the country) has been associ-
ated ecologically with fragmentation and use of agricultural
land and the formation, by this way, of optimal habitats for
H. marginatum vector ticks (Maltezou and Papa 2010).
Some other recent epidemics outside Europe: Iran 248 cases
between 2000 and 2004; Mauretania 38 cases (11 fatal) in
2003. In 2009, human cases of CCHF were also reported
from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Iran, Pakistan, and
Afghanistan.

Diagnosis: RT-PCR, detection of antibodies or antigen
(ELISA, IFA), isolation of the virus (extreme risk).

Treatment: in acute phase (if diagnosed very early) riba-
virin though its efficacy has not been unequivocally con-
firmed in clinical studies. Specific immunoglobulins can be
used prophylactically or therapeutically, but only in the first
days after infection (Vasilev et al. 1991).

Prevention: a vaccine of Bulgarian provenience (inacti-
vated, suckling mouse brains; not commercial, a small scale
production) has been successfully applied to several hun-
dred persons in the Rostov region and Bulgaria (Vasilenko
et al. 1975a, b).

Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Somalia, Senegal,
Guinea, Uganda, Zaire (Congo), Nigeria, Central Africa,
Mauritania, Upper Volta, Kenya, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), S.
Africa, Madagascar. Antibodies have been detected in India,
Egypt, and Tanzania. Livestock movements and migratory
birds play an important role in the transport of infected
vector ticks to other areas. For instance, CCHF virus was
isolated from nymphal H. marginatum removed from Cor-
vus frugilegus, Passer montanus, Galerida cristata, and
Tockus erythrorhynchus in Rostov, Astrakhan, Kirghizia
and Senegal, respectively (Hoogstraal 1979; Wood et al.
1978; Zeller et al. 1994a, b).

Bhanja Bunyavirus (BHAV)

This virus is, together with two other African tick-borne
viruses Kismayo (Butenko et al. 1979) and Forécariah
(Boiro et al. 1986), a member of Bhanja group that has not
yet been assigned to a recognized genus of the family
Bunyaviridae. Synonym or subtype: Palma virus (PoTi-
4.92 strain, isolated from male H. punctata in Portugal,
1992: Filipe et al. 1994); the mean cross-PRNT titre differ-
ences among European, Indian and African strains of BHA
have been found as great as four to tenfold (Hubálek and
Halouzka 1985).

BHAV was isolated first from Haemaphysalis intermedia
(syn. H. parva) ticks that had been collected from a para-
lyzed goat in Bhanjanagar (district Ganjam, Orissa State,
India) in 1954 (prototype strain IG-690), but the record was

published much later (Shah and Work 1969). In Europe, the
first isolation was from adult H. punctata collected in Italy,
1967 (European topotype ISS.IR.205: Verani et al. 1970a, b),
then in Croatia (Vesenjak-Hirjan et al. 1977) and Bulgaria
(Pavlov et al. 1978).

The virus is transmitted by metastriate ixodid ticks of
several species—in Europe H. punctata, Haemaphysalis
sulcata, and D. marginatus; elsewhere H. intermedia, Boo-
philus decoloratus, B. annulatus, B. geigyi, A. variegatum,
H. marginatum, H. detritum, H. dromedarii, H. truncatum,
R. bursa, and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Experimental
transmission including TOT was demonstrated in H. asiat-
icum (Gaidamovich et al. 1976).

Vertebrate hosts for BHAV are sheep, goat (Verani et al.
1971), cattle; in Africa, BHAV was also isolated from the
four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) and striped ground
squirrel (Xerus erythropus). Antibodies were detected in dogs,
C. elaphus, C. capreolus, and Sus scrofa (Punda et al. 1986).
The virus does not usually cause apparent infection in adult
animals but is pathogenic for young ruminants (lamb, kid,
calf), causing fever and CNS affection (meningoencephalitis),
or leucopenia in cattle (Theiler and Downs 1973; Hubálek
1987; Semashko et al. 1976; Camicas et al. 1981; Mádr et al.
1984). Experimental encephalitis was produced in rhesus
monkey (Balducci et al. 1970; Verani et al. 1970b). Fatal to
suckling mouse i.n. and adult mouse (i.c., i.n., but not s.c., i.v.,
p.o., or per conjunctivae). Encephalitis in lamb (i.c., but
not s.c. or i.v.: Semashko et al. 1976; Mádr et al. 1984)
and rhesus monkey (i.c.: Balducci et al. 1970). Not fatal
to adult goat (s.c.), rabbit (i.c., i.n., s.c., i.v., i.m., p.o.;
a low viremia), and several passerine birds. Faint CPE
and plaques produced in BSC-1, RK-13, and primary
mouse embryo (David-West 1971) cells, while multipli-
cation without CPE in HEp-2 cells (David-West 1972).

Natural foci of BHAV are boskematic—pastoral steppe or
forest-steppe ecosystems in xerothermic areas or in karst
habitats at more northern latitudes. Based on a comparison
of several known natural foci of BHAV infection, their com-
mon and typical features were extracted and bio-indicator
species (plants, animals) were selected that can be used for
prediction of potential presence of BHAV in other geographic
areas within Europe (Hubálek 2009).

BHAV causes in human febrile illness with headache,
conjunctivitis, or sometimes meningoencephalitis with pho-
tophobia, vomiting, and pareses. About ten natural and/or
laboratory infections with BHAV have been described in
humans, one of them serious—quadriparesis (Calisher and
Goodpasture 1975; Punda et al. 1980; Vesenjak-Hirjan et al.
1980). There is some occupational risk for shepherds and
veterinary personnel. Probably an underdiagnosed disease
in the Mediterranean and Balkan countries.

European distribution: Fig. 8. Outside Europe: India,
Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Senegal,

Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central Africa, Kenya, Somalia.
Antibodies were detected in Srí Lanka, Pakistan, Iran,
Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Uganda, Tanzania,
Egypt, and Tunisia. Migratory birds might play a role in the
transport of infected immature ticks to distant areas.

Family Reoviridae

Coltivirus Eyach (EYAV)

A member of Colorado tick fever (CTF) group. Serologi-
cally closely related to North-American CTFV by CFT and
VNT; however, CTFV is not neutralized with anti-EYA
serum.

First isolated from I. ricinus ticks collected at Eyach near
Tübbingen, Germany, 1972 (prototype: Eyach-38:
Rehse-Küpper et al. 1976), later (1981) from I. ricinus and
Ixodes ventalloi collected on a wild rabbit in NW. France
(Chastel et al. 1984). There is a hypothesis that this virus, a
descendant of CTF agent, could have been imported from
North America with U.S. Army dogs and their Dermacentor
ticks to a military base situated in Germany after the 2nd
WW, and evolved into Eyach virus under the selective
pressure of European ecosystem (Hubálek and Rudolf
2011). Another hypothesis suggests that CTFV could have
been introduced to Europe with cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus
floridanus (Attoui et al. 1998).

The dsRNA of EYAV consists of 12 segments, in contrast
to the genus Orbivirus with ten segments. Very sensitive to
trypsin, acid, and heat (60°C).

Arthropod vectors are ticks I. ricinus (TST) and I.
ventalloi.

Vertebrate hosts are rodents (they reveal prolonged
experimental viremias) and lagomorphs (Oryctolagus cuni-
culus). Animal infection has an inapparent course, but
meningoencephalitis in suckling mouse (i.c.) has been dem-
onstrated histologically.

Serological data indicate possible association (not yet
reliably demonstrated) of EYAV with human neuropathies
including five patients with meningoencephalitis (Málková
et al. 1980; Fraňková 1981); additional investigation is
necessary. The closely related CTF virus (principal vector
is Dermacentor andersoni) causes acute febrile illness in the
mountainous northwestern parts of North America, with a
number of cases each year.

Diagnosis: serology (IgM ELISA, IFA, VNT; but not
HIT); virus isolation.

European distribution: Fig. 9.

Orbivirus Tribeč (TRBV)

Synonyms (or subtypes): Lipovník (LIP-91, I. ricinus, East
Slovakia, 1963), Koliba, Cvilín (Libíková et al. 1965,

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 23



1977), Brezová (subtype: Hubálek et al. 1987a, b), Mircha
(strain “634”: Vinograd et al. 1977), Kharagysh (Skofertsa et
al. 1972). Member of Kemerovo antigenic group, and the
Kemerovo subgroup (Belhouchet et al. 2010). Contrary to
coltiviruses, orbiviruses of the Kemerovo group have only
10 segments of dsRNAwith a total size of 19 kbp. Prototype
strain: Tribeč (I. ricinus, West Slovakia, 1963). Closely related
to the Siberian Kemerovo virus by CFT but distinguishable by
VNT (Libíková and Buckley 1971; Libíková and Casals

1971) or RNA-RNA hybridization (Brown et al. 1988). Gene
pools of the Kemerovo group and other orbiviruses have a
great reassortment potential (because of the segmented
dsRNA) and resulting biological variability (Gorman et al.
1978, 1983; Gorman 1983; Brown et al. 1988, 1989). Inter-
estingly, rabbit syncytium virus that occurs in S. floridanus
rabbit in the USA is also closely related to TRBV.

First 28 strains of TRBV were isolated from I. ricinus in
three regions of Slovakia in 1963; a few strains had been

marginatus vector ticks

isolated already in 1961 but lost thereafter (Libíková 1964;
Libíková et al. 1964, 1965; Grešíková et al. 1965).

Nearly resistant to diethyl ether and sodium deoxycholate
but very sensitive to acid (even pH 5–6), alkali (pH 10) and
trypsin.

TRBV is transmitted by ticks I. ricinus (TST) and I.
persulcatus, occasionally by H. punctata (Topciu et al.
1968).

Vertebrate hosts of TRBV are rodents, e.g., M. glareolus
and M. subterraneus (Grešíková et al. 1965), hare L. euro-
paeus (Dobler et al. 2006), goat (Grešíková et al. 1965),
European starling S. vulgaris and chaffinch F. coelebs
(Skofertsa et al. 1974, 1976). Antibodies are present very
often in grazed ruminants in endemic areas (up to 45–88 %
reactors: Hubálek et al. 1986). Animal disease is unknown
(inapparent). However, TRBV is fatal to suckling mouse
(also s.c.: meningoencephalitis—progressive neuronal and
glial damage with perivascular infiltration), suckling rat, and
suckling Syrian hamster (i.c., but not s.c.). Meningitis but
survival or no symptoms at all in adult mouse inoculated i.c.
(but local necrotizing encephalitis demonstrated histologi-
cally), while no symptoms in adult mouse given s.c., i.n. or
p.o., adult rat (i.c.), rabbit (i.c.), and peripherally inoculated
calf or foal. Fever and meningitis are present in rhesus
monkey inoculated i.c. (Grešíková et al. 1966).

The virus causes an occasional febrile illness or aseptic
meningitis in humans—e.g., at least 15 patients with the
CNS infection (meningitis) revealed seroconversion against
TRBV in Czechland (Fraňková 1981; Málková et al. 1986;
Hubálek et al. 1987a, b). Antibodies occur in human popu-
lation, interestingly at a higher frequency among patients
with multiple sclerosis (Libíková et al. 1978). There is
potential occupational risk for forestry workers. The disease
caused by TRBV is probably underdiagnosed. Additional
studies are necessary to evaluate the public health impor-
tance of TRBV.

Diagnosis: serology (CFT, VNT; but not HIT because
these viruses do not produce hemagglutinin). Therefore,
HIT (and ELISA) cannot be normally used in diagnostic
serology.

European distribution: Fig. 10 Outside Europe TRBV
was isolated exceptionally in northern Africa. Migratory
birds have been implicated in the dispersal of Kemerovo
serogroup viruses over vast distances. For instance, the
Siberian Kemerovo virus was isolated from a southward
migrating Phoenicurus phoenicurus in Egypt (Schmidt and
Shope 1971; Brown et al. 1988).

Orbivirus Okhotskiy (OKHV)

Kemerovo antigenic group, the Great Island (GI) subgroup.
Prototype: LEIV-70C (I. uriae, Tyuleniy Island—Far East,
1970). Antigenically and genetically closely related to other

Kemerovo group and especially GI subgroup viruses; prob-
ably identical with CWV because it hybridizes to all ten
OKHV genes. The GI complex viruses may represent a
single viral gene pool, i.e., one species (Brown et al. 1989;
Belhouchet et al. 2010).

OKHV was originally isolated from nymphal I. uriae
collected in rocky breeding grounds of seabirds on Tyuleniy
Island, Sea of Okhotsk (Russian Far East) in 1970 (Lvov
et al. 1973a, b, c, d). In Europe, it was isolated under similar
conditions in the Murmansk region, N. Russia, 1970 (Lvov
et al. 1989).

The main arthropod vector is I. uriae (TST, TOT), occa-
sionally I. signatus.

Vertebrate hosts are seabirds: R. tridactyla; antibodies
were also detected in F. glacialis, U. aalge, and Phalacro-
corax pelagicus. Avian disease is unknown.

Human disease has not been reported, although antibod-
ies were detected in 12 % of inhabitants on the Commodore
Islands.

European distribution: Fig. 11 Outside Europe: coastal
Asian Russia (Far East), USA and Canada. Seabirds dis-
perse the GI complex viruses transoceanically and introduce
them to new areas and new hosts; the GI members therefore
occur both in subarctic and subantarctic regions (Lvov and
Ilyichev 1979).

Orbivirus Cape Wrath (CWV)

Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype:
ScotAr-20 (CW-20; I. uriae, Scotland, 1973). Antigenically
and genetically closely related to GI, BAU, MYK, TDM,
OKH, Nugget and Yaquina Head viruses; In fact, probably
identical with (i.e., a synonym of) Okhotskiy virus because it
hybridizes to all ten OKH genes (Brown et al. 1989). Very
similar or identical non-registered viruses are Arbroath (ARB-
1, Scotland: Moss and Nuttall 1985), Broadhaven (FT-363:
Carey and Nuttall 1989; Jacobs et al. 1986; Nuttall et al. 1981,
1990a, b), Wexford (GS-80-9, SE. Ireland: Nuttall et al.
1984a; Carey and Nuttall 1989), Thormodseyjarklettur
(Iceland), Scottish strains Mill Door/79, Above Maiden,
Colony, Foula, Mill Door, North Clett, and Shiant Islands,
Irish Great Saltee Island GS 80-4,-7,-8, Ellidaye ELL-3a and
Grimsey (Iceland), English isolates Lundy, Inner Farne IF79-
1,-2, and North End, Rost Islands NorV-808,-871,-962, and
Vaeroy (Norway—Lofoten), and a number of other strains
(Jacobs et al. 1986; Labuda and Nuttall 2004). Some of these
viruses can be differentiated in PRNT (Carey and Nuttall
1989), but they reassort readily at a high frequency (Moss
et al. 1988; Nuttall et al. 1990a, b; Nuttall and Moss 1989).
Only minor variability has also been found in the induced
protein profiles among different CWVand CWV-like isolates
(Black et al. 1986; Spence et al. 1986). The gene reassortment
potential of the isolates confirms the close taxonomic

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 25



relationship of all the GI subgroup members which may, in
fact, represent a single gene pool (Moss et al. 1988; Brown et
al. 1989; Nuttall et al. 1990a) and therefore one virus species.

First isolated from engorged female I. uriae collected in a
colony of the common murre U. aalge at Clo Mor on Cape
Wrath, Scotland, June 1973 (Main et al. 1976a, b).

The virus is sensitive to trypsin and acid (pH 3) but
resistant at pH 5.

Arthropod vector is I. uriae.
Vertebrate hosts are marine birds. Antibodies were detected

inU. aalge, A. torda, andO. leucorrhoa (Main et al. 1976a, b;
Nuttall et al. 1984a, b). However, avian disease is unknown.
Suckling mouse is a rather insusceptible system for the CWV
isolation attempts (Nuttall et al. 1984a, b).

Human disease has not been reported.

Orbivirus Mykines (MYKV) and Tindholmur (TDMV)

Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype
MYKV is DenAr-12 (I. uriae, Faeroe Islands, 1974), and
TDMV DenAr-2 (I. uriae, Faeroe Islands, 1974). Both
viruses are distinguishable by CFT, and antigenically related
to CWV, GIV, BAUV, Yaquina Head, OKHV and other GI
subgroup viruses (Brown et al. 1989).

First isolates originated from female I. uriae ticks col-
lected in puffin (F. arctica) colonies at Mykines and
Tindholmur, Faeroe Islands in 1974 (Main 1978).

Arthropod vectors: I. uriae.
Vertebrate hosts: probably F. arctica.
Animal and human disease has not been reported.
European distribution: Fig. 11.

Orbivirus Bauline (BAUV)

Kemerovo antigenic group, the GI subgroup. Prototype:
CanAr-14 (I. uriae, Canada, 1971). European topotype: FI-
873 (I. uriae, Norway, 1974). The Norwegian isolates FI-
873 and FI-962 have been found identical with prototype
BAUV by RNA–RNA hybridization (Brown et al. 1989).
Antigenically closely related to other members of the GI or
Kemerovo subgroups (Brown et al. 1989), and indistin-
guishable from GI virus (CanAr-41) by CFT; both viruses
can be differentiated by VNT (Main et al. 1973). Some
BAUVand GIV isolates from Newfoundland have exhibited
a remarkable variation in all ten genome segments (Oprandy
et al. 1988).

Originally isolated from engorged nymphal I. uriae ticks
collected during July 1971 in a F. arctica colony on Great
Island off the SE. coast of Newfoundland, Canada (Main et
al. 1973). In Europe, it was isolated from I. uriae collected
in a seabird colony on Rost Island, Lofoten (Norway) in
1974 (Brown et al. 1989; Saikku et al. 1980).

Vertebrate hosts are unknown; antibodies were detected
in F. arctica and O. leucorrhoa birds.

Animal and human disease has not been reported.
European distribution: Fig. 11. Outside Europe: Canada

(Newfoundland). Documented transoceanic flights of puf-
fins from NW. Europe to Newfoundland and vice versa
contribute to the dissemination of the GI subgroup viruses
over wide geographical areas (Lvov and Ilyichev 1979;
Main et al. 1973).

Family Orthomyxoviridae

Thogotovirus Thogoto (THOV)

Thogoto antigenic group. Prototype: Ken-IIA (mixed metas-
triate tick spp., Kenya, 1960). African topotype: IbAr-2012
(Boophilus spp., Nigeria, 1964); European topotype: SiAr-

126 (R. bursa, Sicily, 1969). THOV shares only 15–20 %
nucleotide homology with influenza orthomyxoviruses.
Virions are spherical, 80–120 nm, enveloped, contain ss(−)
RNA arranged in six segments with a total size of 10 kbp,
and one surface glycoprotein. Some strains form HA in the
liver and blood serum of SM or in Vero cells, whereas not in
suckling mouse brain.

First isolated from a pool of B. decoloratus and Rhipice-
phalus spp. ticks collected on cattle in Thogoto Forest near
Nairobi, Kenya in 1960 (Haig et al. 1965). In Europe, it was
first isolated from ticks collected on ruminants in Sicily,
1969 (Albanese et al. 1971, 1972; Srihongse et al. 1974)
and then in Portugal in 1978 (Filipe and Calisher 1984).

Arthropod vectors are metastriate ticks only—B. decol-
oratus, B. annulatus, A. variegatum, R. appendiculatus,
Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Portugal), R. bursa (Sicily), Rhi-
picephalus evertsi, other Rhipicephalus spp., Hyalomma
truncatum, and H. anatolicum.

Vertebrate hosts are cattle, camel, and man (isolations in
Africa). Antibodies were also detected in sheep and goat.
THOV causes leucopenia in cattle, and fever, and abortion
in sheep (Davies et al. 1984). Fatal to, and highly hepato-
tropic or pantropic in, adult mouse (Filipe et al. 1986) and
adult Syrian hamster (i.p.). No symptoms in suckling ham-
ster and rabbit (i.p.). CPE is produced in primary mouse
embryo and lamb testis cells; faint CPE in HEp-2 cells
(David-West 1971, 1972).

Natural foci are boskematic—pastoral xerothermic
ecosystems.

Human disease: two cases have been described, one with
bilateral optic neuritis and another as a fatal meningoen-
cephalitis with hepatitis although complicated by a sickle-
cell disease (Theiler and Downs 1973; Moore et al. 1975).
THOV is probably contagious from man to man. Antibodies
occur rarely in human sera in Europe: e.g., only 1 % sero-
positive persons were detected in Portugal (Filipe et al.
1985).

European distribution: Fig. 12. Outside Europe THOV
occurs in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Cameroon,
Central Africa, Egypt, Iran. Tick-infested domestic animals
(e.g., camels) and migratory birds could disseminate the
virus over a wide geographic range (Calisher et al. 1987).

Thogotovirus Dhori (DHOV)

Prototype: IG-611313 (Hyalomma dromedarii, India, 1961).
European topotype: PoTi-461 “Vidigueira” (male H. mar-
ginatum, Portugal, 1971). Synonyms: Astra (Butenko and
Chumakov 1971), Batken (LEIV-306 K: H. marginatum,
collected on sheep in Kirghizia, 1970: Lvov et al. 1974).
Nucleotide sequence data suggest that DHOV is distantly
related to influenza viruses but their envelope proteins (HA,
neuraminidase) differ significantly. Virions are spherical,

Parasitol Res (2012) 111:9–36 27



80–120 nm, enveloped, contain ss(−)RNA arranged in 7
segments with a total size of 10 kbp, and one surface
glycoprotein. HA is also produced in Vero cells, and HIT
can use goose, sheep, monkey or human RBC.

DHOV was first isolated from Hyalomma dromedarii
ticks collected on camels in Dhori, Gujarat State, India in
1961 (Anderson and Casals 1973). In Europe, it has been
isolated several times from Hyalomma marginatum and
twice from Hyalomma scupense collected at Astrakhan,
South Russia since 1969 (as “Astra” virus: (Butenko and
Chumakov 1971; Butenko et al. 1987; Bannova et al. 1974;
Smirnova et al. 1988) and in Crimea (one strain
—“Batken”); additional two strains were obtained from H.
scupense near Astrakhan (Smirnova et al. 1988) and another
one in southern Portugal, 1971 (Filipe and Casals 1979).

Arthropod vectors are metastriate ticks H. dromedarii, H.
marginatum (Europe), H. scupense and D. marginatus. Oc-
casional isolations of DHOV were reported from Ornitho-
doros lahorensis and mosquitoes (Anopheles hyrcanus,
Aedes caspius, Culex hortensis).

Vertebrate hosts are camel, horse, bats (Kirghizia), but
animal disease is unknown (asymptomatic). Antibodies
have also been detected in goats, sheep and cattle (Filipe
et al. 1985). DHOV is hepatotropic, and causing diffuse
necrosis of neurons in mouse (Filipe et al. 1990). No symp-
toms were observed in inoculated adult or young rabbit (i.c.,
i.p., s.c.). No CPE or plaques (but multiplication) produced
in BSC-1, L, human embryo kidney cells; CPE formed in
monkey kidney 6619-1 cells (Smirnova et al. 1988).

Natural foci: boskematic (pastoral xerothermic and semi-
desert ecosystems).

Human disease: acute illness with severe fever, headache,
general weakness, retrobulbar pain, with encephalitis in c.
40 % of patients and a long, 2-month convalescence period.
Five cases of severe laboratory infection (due to aerosol)
have been described (Butenko et al. 1987). The virus could
also be contagious from man to man.

European distribution: Fig. 12. Seroprevalence rate
among humans is relatively high in Astrakhan (4–9 %) but
low in Portugal (0.8 %: Filipe et al. 1985). Outside Europe
DHOV occurs in India, Egypt, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, and antibodies were detected in

Family Asfarviridae

Asfivirus of African swine fever (ASFV)

The only DNA arbovirus occurring in Europe. There are
several antigenic types, while no recognized prototype
strain of ASFV. Hemadsorption-inhibiting antibodies are
isolate specific, but HA is not produced. Interestingly,
neutralizing antibodies do not appear in vertebrates. The
virus is sensitive to dodecyl sulphate and heat (60°C)
while less sensitive to putrefaction, formaldehyde and
alkali.

History: originally isolated by R.E. Montgomery from
the blood of a sick pig in Kenya, 1910, and in Europe ASFV
was first isolated in 1957 (Karabatsos 1985).

Arthropod vectors are soft ticks Ornithodoros moubata
porcinus (TST, TOT) in Africa, and O. erraticus in SW.
Europe.

Vertebrate hosts are S. scrofa (domestic and wild
swine), in Africa also common warthog Phacochoerus
africanus (main reservoir), bushpig Potamochoerus por-
cus, giant forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni (Jori
and Bastos 2009). The wild suids are the reservoir of
ASFV with usually inapparent infection (except for S.
scrofa). ASF is a pantropic, highly contagious disease
of pigs with fever, cough, anorexia, skin cyanosis, in-
coordination, diarrhea; destruction of lymphoreticular
elements, vasculitis, widespread hemorrhages, thrombo-
ses, infarction, and abortion (Schlafer and Mebus 1984).
Lethality is 100 % with virulent strains in naive com-
mercial pig populations, while some strains may pro-
duce mild disease and carriership. Cattle, sheep, goat,
dog and rabbit (s.c., i.v.) are insusceptible though the
virus recovery has been sometimes reported in rabbit
and goat. CPE is produced in primary porcine leuco-
cyte, bone marrow and kidney cells.

European epizootics of ASF occurred in Portugal
(1957 and 1960: Filipe 1980), SW. Spain (since 1957:
Oleaga-Perez et al. 1990), Sardinia, Malta, recently in
the Caucasus region (since 2007) including southern
Russia (North Ossetia, Krasnodar territory, 2008–
2011), and temporarily in France (1964), Italy (1967,
1983: Swaney et al . 1987), Belgium, and the
Netherlands.

Natural foci: mainly tropical and subtropical pastoral
ecosystems. Principally a wild hog/pig-Ornithodoros cycle.
Moreover, circulation in pig pens in rural habitats.

Human disease has not been reported.

European distribution: Fig. 13. Occasionally intro-
duced into southern Europe, Belgium, and the Nether-
lands. Outside Europe: many African countries;
temporarily Brazil and some Caribbean islands (Cuba,
Haiti).

Conclusions

Several “European” tiboviruses cause very serious human
(CEEV, RSSEV, CCHFV) or animal (LIV, ASFV) diseases.
Other arboviruses play definite role in human or animal
pathology though the disease is usually either less serious
or infrequently reported (TYUV, BHAV, AVAV, EYAV,
TRBV, DHOV, THOV). In general, three groups of tibovi-
rus diseases can be recognized according to main clinical
symptoms produced: (i) febrile illness—usually with a rapid
onset, fever, sweating, headache, nausea, weakness, myal-
gia, arthralgia, sometimes polyarthritis and rash; (ii) the
CNS affection—meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or en-
cephalomyelitis with pareses, paralysis, and other sequelae;
(iii) hemorrhagic disease. The other European arboviruses
are “orphans” without a proven medical or veterinary sig-
nificance (BAHV, MTRV, MEAV, GAV, PTVV, ZTV,
SAHV, UUKV, SOLV, PIV, AVAV, CMV, OKHV, CWV,
MYKV, TDMV, BAUV). However, certain arbovirus dis-
eases of free-living vertebrates (but also those of domestic
animals and even man) may often pass unnoticed or mis-
diagnosed and eventually, they might potentially appear as
emerging diseases. In addition, active search for new

tiboviruses or for new, pathogenic variants of the known
tiboviruses in Europe should continue.

We isolated 11 Siberian subtype tickborne encephalitis
virus (TBEV) strains from Ixodes persulcatus ticks from a
TBEV-endemic focus in the Kokkola Archipelago, western
Finland. Thus I. persulcatus and the Siberian TBEV are
reported in a focus considerably northwest of their previ-
ously known range in eastern Europe and Siberia.

Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease endemic in azone extending from central and eastern Europe to
Siberia and Japan. Three subtypes of the causative agent
tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are known: the
European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (1,2). The main vec-
tor for the European subtype is Ixodes ricinus, and for the
other 2 subtypes, I. persulcatus (1,3–5). I. ricinus is found
in Europe and Middle East (6), and I. persulcatus ranges
from eastern Europe to China and Japan. The boundary
between their distribution lies at the Russian side of the
Finnish-Russian border (1,7). The distribution areas of
both tick species overlap in eastern Europe (4,5)
(Figure 1). I. persulcatus has not been reported from north-
ern or western Europe except for an engorged nymph on a
willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) in northeastern
Sweden in May 1992 (6).

In Finland, the TBE-endemic areas are mostly in the
coastal regions: two thirds of cases come from the Åland
Islands. Other TBE-endemic regions include the
Archipelago of Turku, a focus in Isosaari (an island outside
Helsinki), the Lappeenranta region in southeastern
Finland, and the Archipelago of Kokkola in western
Finland (9). The virus was found in the same areas (except
for Isosaari) as early as the 1960s by screening antibodies
to TBEV from cattle sera (10).

The TBE focus in the Archipelago of Kokkola
(63°50'N, 23°10'E), ≈300 km south of the Arctic Circle,
has a peculiar location; it is an isolated focus, far from

other TBE-endemic areas, and is the northernmost TBE-
endemic area known. Furthermore, the recent TBE cases
have been severe with sequelae (11,12). A cluster of cases
in 2002 led us to study ticks in the Kokkola Archipelago
for TBEV.

The Study
A total of 1,181 ticks were collected by flagging in the

Archipelago of Kokkola in June 2004 (Table 1). In the
tick-collecting areas 1–7, TBE patients had reported tick
bites, and in areas 8–10, no TBE cases have been found.
All the locations were islands or peninsulas within 20 km
of each other.

The ticks were homogenized in pools of ≈10 with
Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% bovine
serum albumin (D-PBS-BSA) and sand to 122 pools. RNA
was isolated from 100 µL of the pools by TriPure Isolation
Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Espoo, Finland). The RNA
was dissolved in 20 µL diethyl pyrocarbonate–treated
water, and 10 µL was used for nested reverse transcription
(RT)–PCR, amplifying a 252-nt sequence from the TBEV-
NS5 gene to detect TBEV-RNA according to
Puchhammer-Stöckl et al. (13), except that the outer for-
ward primer used was 5′-GGAGGCTGAACAACTG-
CAC-3′. TBEV-RNA was detected in 13 pools (each
consisted of 10 adult ticks) (Table 1). Assuming that only

1 tick in a positive pool was positive for TBEV RNA, the
overall TBEV prevalence was 1.1%.

To isolate TBEV strains from the RT-PCR–positive tick
pools, 20 µL of the supernatant of the pools diluted 1:1 in
D-PBS-BSA was injected intracerebrally into suckling
NMRI mice. One litter of suckling mice was used for each
pool. The mice were followed for 14 days or until symp-
toms of illness appeared, and then they were killed. From
200 µL of the homogenized mouse brains, diluted 1:5 with
D-PBS-BSA, RNA was extracted by TriPure, and RT-PCR
for the partial TBEV-E gene was performed. The cDNA
was produced with the reverse primer 5′-CCYCCAGC-
CARGAGRAAGC-3′ by M-MuLV-RT enzyme
(Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and subsequent PCR was
performed with this and a forward primer 5′-
AACAGGGAYTTTGTCACTGGYACTC-3′ by Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas) (detailed RT-PCR protocol avail-
able from the authors upon request).

A region of 205 nt from the NS5 gene from the RT-
PCR–positive tick pools and 1,225-nt stretch from the E
gene from the brains of the infected suckling mice were
sequenced (GenBank accession nos. in Table 2). Unex-
pectedly, based on the partial NS5 sequences from the RT-
PCR–positive tick pools (data not shown), the TBEV
strains in Kokkola belonged to the Siberian subtype of
TBEV. A phylogenetic tree based on the partial E gene
sequences (1,076 nt) obtained from the TBEV isolates was
prepared by the maximum likelihood method (Figure 2,
scripts and datasets available from the authors upon
request). Within the 1,076-nt stretch of the E gene, the
Kokkola strains were >99.6% identical to each other. The
closest relatives were Latvia-1-96 (97% identical) and the
Estonian strains Est54, Est3535, and EK328 (95%–96%).
Consequently, the Siberian subtype strains isolated from
Finland and nearby Baltic states form a lineage together
within the Siberian subtype. Other Siberian subtype strains
Vasilchenko, Aina, Zausaev, and TBEV228 showed
92%–94% identity, and the European and Far Eastern sub-
types showed 84%–86% identity. However, the vector tick

species for Siberian-type TBEV, I. persulcatus, was not
known to exist in Finland. This knowledge led us to study
the tick species more carefully. DNA was isolated from 20
tick pools by TriPure and resuspended in 100 µL of TE
(Tris-HCl 10 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, pH ≈8). The tick
species was determined as I. persulcatus by amplifying an
average of 339 bp from mitochondrial 16S RNA gene by
PCR and subsequent sequencing according to Caporale et
al. (14). Because the ticks were pooled and homogenized
before species identification, 30 adult ticks from the same
region collected later in the summer were examined micro-
scopically. All these specimens were I. persulcatus by
morphologic criteria.

Conclusions
A TBE focus has existed in the Kokkola Archipelago at

least since the 1960s when TBEV antibodies were detect-
ed in cattle (10), but the local TBE viruses have not been
characterized. A cluster of severe human cases in the
beginning of the 2000s prompted us to carry out the pres-
ent study. In June 2004, we collected 1,181 ticks from the
Archipelago of Kokkola and detected TBEV-RNA in 13
pools. Eleven were also positive in virus isolation. The
sequences showed that the strains belonged to the Siberian
subtype, whereas in the other Finnish TBE-endemic foci,
only European subtype TBEV closely related to the central
European strains has previously been detected (15).
Furthermore, the tick species was I. persulcatus. Our
results show that both I. persulcatus and the Siberian type
TBEV are occurring several hundreds of kilometers further
to northwest than what has been known previously.
Because the 2 tick species are similar to the naked eye and
in their behavior, and published data on distribution of
Ixodes ticks in Finland are sparse and outdated, we cannot
exclude the possibility that I. persulcatus also exists unno-
ticed elsewhere in Finland. More tick surveys and epi-
demiologic studies are needed to map the distribution areas
of the 2 vector species and of the different TBEV subtypes
in Finland. However, in our recent tick collections from

Åland and southern (Isosaari, 60°N, 25°E) and eastern
(Lappeenranta, 61°N, 28°E, and Joensuu, 62°N, 29°E)
Finland, all ticks were I. ricinus.

Some researchers have found indications that the
Siberian TBEV might cause more severe or more persist-

ent forms of TBE than the European subtype (4), and 3 of
5 recent human TBE cases in Kokkola have been severe
(11,12). However, the number of cases studied from
Kokkola is too small for firm conclusions on the severity
of the local disease.

Abstract. Entebbe bat virus (ENTV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), closely related to yellow fever virus, was first isolated
from a little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) in Uganda in 1957, but was not detected after that initial isolation.
In 2011, we isolated ENTV from a little free-tailed bat captured from the attic of a house near where it had originally
been found. Infectious virus was recovered from the spleen and lung, and the viral RNA was sequenced and compared
with that of the original isolate. Across the polypeptide sequence, there were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in
97.8% identity at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates. Further study of this virus would provide
valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and transmission of bat- and mosquito-
borne flaviviruses.

Bat virus investigations in Uganda were initially inspired
in the mid-1950s by the isolations of rabies virus and a
novel flavivirus, later to become known as Rio Bravo virus
(Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), from the salivary glands of insec-
tivorous bats in the United States.1–3 Subsequently, investi-
gators at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)
collected bats from the attic of UVRI, dissected salivary
glands, and isolated viruses by intracerebral inoculation of
triturated salivary gland extracts into neonatal mice.4,5 This
first effort resulted in the isolation of Entebbe bat salivary
gland virus, strain IL-30 (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) from a
little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus) (Cretzchmar).4,5

The taxon was then recognized by one of its synonyms:
Tadarida (Chaerephon) limbata (Peters). Lumsden and others4,5

determined that this isolate was a novel flavivirus through
a series of neutralization tests using immune sera against
20 arboviruses as well as against Rio Bravo virus. By 1964,
bat virus research had expanded at UVRI, and sampling of
1,022 additional bats yielded 14 strains of viruses including
Dakar bat virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) also from little
free-tailed bats, and Bukalasa bat virus (Flaviviridae:
Flavivirus) from Angolan free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus)
(A. Smith).6 Isolation of Mount Elgon bat virus (Rhabdoviridae:
Ledantevirus) followed shortly thereafter from an eloquent
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hildebrandtii eloquens) (K. Anderson)
captured in Kenya, with the virus being isolated and charac-
terized at UVRI.7,8 Additional bat virus discoveries in Uganda
later included Kasokero virus (Bunyaviridae, unassigned) from
an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (E. Geoffroy).9

Entebbe bat virus (ENTV, renamed), Bukalasa bat virus, and
Dakar bat virus were all isolated from insectivorous bats
captured in the attic of UVRI.10 Serological surveys suggested
that the infection prevalence of ENTV in wild populations of
little free-tailed bats was high, but ENTV was never isolated
again after the original discovery.10,11

To follow up on these early studies, arbovirus surveil-
lance of bats was conducted in Uganda from 2011 to 2013.
Bats were captured from attics in several locations around
Entebbe and Kampala as part of a larger, country-wide sam-

pling effort to be reported elsewhere. All bat captures were
conducted under the approval of CDC/DVBD IACUC pro-
tocol 010-015. Bats were captured in attics using mist nets,
taking appropriate biosafety precautions. On capture, bats
were placed individually in cloth holding bags. Bats were
anesthetized with halothane, exsanguinated by cardiac punc-
ture, and euthanized by halothane overdose and cervical dis-
location. Blood from bats was collected directly into serum
separator tubes, centrifuged in the field, and placed immedi-
ately in a nitrogen dry vapor shipper. Liver, spleen, heart,
lung, and kidney were all collected directly into cryovials
and stored immediately on dry ice. In total, 95 little free-
tailed bats and 34 Angolan free-tailed bats were captured in
2011, 15 little free-tailed bats in 2012, and 70 little free-tailed
bats in 2013.
Virus isolation was attempted first from spleens, and on a

positive result, virus isolation was also performed from the
remaining tissues harvested from the infected bat. A single
virus was isolated from 1 of 180 (0.5%) little free-tailed bats.
The infected bat was an adult male, captured in Banga,
Nakiwogo (0°04.884′ N, 32°27.030′ E) on June 23, 2011, near
UVRI. Infectious virus was isolated from the spleen and
lung; no infectious virus was recovered from the heart, liver,
or kidney. No other tissues, oral or fecal swabs were col-
lected from the insectivorous bats captured in 2011. The
isolate was initially identified as ENTV by sequencing of
the flavivirus NS5 amplicon using primers FU2/CFD3,12 fol-
lowed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Virus isola-
tions, nucleic acid preparations, and NGS were performed
as described previously.13 Novel primers were designed from
contigs generated from the NGS data using Primer 3 software
(Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge,
MA)14 (Supplemental Table 1), and the sequence for the
entire genome was confirmed by direct sequencing. End ter-
minal sequences were obtained using 5′/3′ RACE (FirstChoice®

RLM-RACE, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus-specific RACE primers
are provided in Supplemental Table 1. The 5′ outer reaction
used primer 514R in combination with the 5′ RACE outer
primer. The 5′ RACE inner reactions used primer 388R
together with the 5′ RACE inner primer; amplification was also
achieved with primers 15F + 388R. The 3′ outer reaction used
either primer 9882F or 10328F in combination with the 3′
RACE outer primer. The 3′ inner RACE was not successful.

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated in
MEGA version 6.015 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and
Informatics, Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) using 10,493
nucleotides spanning the open reading frame sequence of select
flavivirus genomes available in GenBank (Figure 1). The analy-
sis was performed using a complete deletion substitution model
and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
In total, 10,663 nucleotides of the ENTV genome were

obtained (GenBank Accession number KP233893), of which
the polypeptide is encoded between nucleotides 120 and
10,355. Kuno and Chang16 published the only other existing
ENTV genome (DQ837641) sequenced from the original IL-30
strain. Compared with that original sequence, we report an
additional 153 nucleotides in the 3′ noncoding region, but
also experienced difficulty in obtaining the complete 3′ ter-
minal sequence.16 Across the polypeptide sequence, there
were 76 amino acid substitutions, resulting in 97.8% identity
at the amino acid level between the 1957 and 2011 isolates.
Before sequencing, the 1957 isolate had been passaged in
suckling mouse brain, but the earlier passage history is unclear;
the 2011 isolate was passaged twice in Vero cells. This 2.2%
amino acid divergence is within the range that has been
observed for other flaviviruses with isolations ranging between
1 and 49 years apart,17–19 indicating relatively little change in
the ENTV genome in 54 years since the first isolation.
Every gene had at least one amino acid change except

for PrM and M (Table 1). The highest percent divergence
between the two isolates was in NS4A, 10.3% (Table 1).
NS4A is a small, multifunctional, hydrophobic protein that plays
a role in modulating the host’s type I interferon response.20 It
has also been shown to associate with host cellular vimentin
during dengue virus replication to stabilize the replication
complex.21 The functional significance of this high percentage
of amino acid divergence has yet to be determined, but Hahn

and others22 surmised that a large number of amino acid sub-
stitutions could be accommodated among the small, hydro-
phobic polypeptides NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B so long
as the hydrophobicity profile remained unchanged. In this
case, changes to the NS4A hydrophobicity profile between
these two isolates were inconsequential. Two of the 76 amino
acid changes occurred at the junctions of NS2A/NS2B, and
at NS4A/2K. The lengths of all of the genes were identical to
those previously reported.16

The phylogenetic relationship between ENTV and yellow
fever virus (YFV) is very interesting, as YFV is historically one
of the most medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses.
Although ENTV falls phylogenetically within the mosquito-
borne flaviviruses and historically has been placed in the
YFV group,16,23 it has only been isolated twice from bats
(1957 and 2011) and never from wild-caught mosquitoes or
humans. Figure 1 confirms the phylogenetic placement of

both isolates of ENTV, as published previously,12,16,23 and
also supports the more recent International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses placement of ENTV in the Entebbe
bat virus group, a sister clade to the YFV group.24 Consistent
with this new grouping, ENTV shared the closest sequence
homology with Sokoluk virus, which has been isolated from
insectivorous bats and soft ticks in Kyrgyzstan.25 Pathogenicity
experiments were not conducted as part of this study, but origi-
nally ENTV was shown to be pathogenic to adult mice by the
intracerebral route and for infant mice by both intracerebral
and intraperitoneal routes.4,5 In our experience, it caused cyto-
pathic effects and produced plaques on Vero cells. ENTV also
replicates in mosquito cells.26 Despite remaining an obscure
bat-associated virus for over a half century, ENTV continues
to circulate among little free-tailed bats in Uganda. Further
study of this virus would provide valuable insights into the
ecological and genetic factors governing the evolution and
transmission of bat-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We
present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique
in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents,
another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic
viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological
factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted
by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species
in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence
for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young),
greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a
new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per
species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between
bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among
bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species,
the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in
rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent
species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern
as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease
emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive
framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.
1. Introduction
Emerging infectious diseases threaten global biodiversity and public health
[1–3]. Most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of humans are
zoonoses. Most zoonoses originate in wildlife and are increasing over time
[3–5]; however, the relative importance of different groups of wildlife hosts
in the emergence of zoonoses remains unclear, as do the mechanisms driving
such differences.

Bats (Order Chiroptera) provide considerable ecosystem
services, such as arthropod suppression, seed dispersal and
pollination, across a vast range of regions and habitats. How-
ever, bats are receiving increasing attention as potential
reservoirs for zoonotic diseases following recent identification
of their involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome-
like coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, as well as
Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses [6]. Consequently, there
has been repeated speculation that bats may be unique in
their potential to harbour zoonotic viruses [6–8]. Traits that
may make bats suited to hosting more viruses in general (zoo-
notic and non-zoonotic) include relatively long lifespans for
their body size [9], which may facilitate viral persistence for
chronic infections; the reliance of some on prolonged torpor,
which can decrease both viral replication and immune function
[10,11]; and flight, allowing movement and dispersal over long
distances in some species. Additionally, many bat species are
gregarious, some living in dense aggregations: for example,
some Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana)
colonies can reach densities of 3000 bats per square metre, in
populations of up to a million individuals per roost [12,13].
Roosting sites can house diverse assemblages of multiple bat
species [14,15]. High intra- and interspecific contact rates can
facilitate rapid transmission of pathogens and large population
sizes could sustain acute-immunizing infections. Additionally,
there are some traits that may make bats more likely to host
zoonotic viruses in particular and/or transmit them to
humans. In evolutionary terms, bats are ancient mammals
and it has been hypothesized that viruses which evolved in
bats may use highly conserved cellular receptors, thus enhan-
cing their ability to transmit viruses to other mammals [6].
Many species of bats have peridomestic habits, roosting in
houses and other buildings, as well as trees in dense urban
areas, leading to frequent human contact with bat excreta
[16–18]. Bat–human contact is also increasing in recent dec-
ades owing to habitat encroachment and increased use of
bats as bushmeat [17–21]. However, despite the speculation
that bats are unusual in their potential to host zoonotic viruses,
there are no quantitative comparative analyses to support this
hypothesis.

Identifying reservoir species is key to controlling emerg-
ing infectious diseases, but there is currently no framework
for characterizing the likely role a potential host species
may play. Therefore, a general approach is needed for under-
standing how host–pathogen communities are broadly
structured. A growing area of research in ecology relies on
trait-based approaches to predict community assembly [22].
These approaches concentrate on traits of species in an
attempt to find generalities in species interactions with each
other and with the environment. Characterizing which
traits are associated with pathogens and their reservoir
hosts will contribute to understanding basic disease emer-
gence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help to focus
future research and disease mitigation efforts.

In this study, we make a first attempt to quantitatively
address the hypothesis that bats are unique hosts of zoonotic
viruses, and further, apply a trait-based approach to identify
life-history, physiological and ecological traits that correlate
with a species’ propensity to host zoonotic viruses. Rodents
(Order Rodentia) are a suitable comparison group as they
are important reservoir hosts of a number of zoonotic viral
pathogens with significant impacts on public health [23].
These pathogens include hantaviruses (causing hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome and haemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome; [24]) and arenaviruses (causing, e.g. lymphocytic
choriomeningitis, Lassa fever and Argentine, Bolivian, Vene-
zuelan and Brazilian haemorrhagic fevers [25]). Rodents also
share a number of characteristics with bats that have been
hypothesized to affect reservoir potential; both taxonomic
orders are evolutionarily ancient, diverse and include many
species with peridomestic habits and species that com-
monly express torpor. Rodents are more diverse than bats
in numbers of species and life-history strategies (the repro-
duction-longevity trade-off ), which enables a more general
examination of host correlates for viral richness across taxo-
nomic orders. We also investigate a series of factors that
may be important in pathogen sharing, such as host related-
ness, geographical overlap and conservation status (which
may be important in pathogen sharing, e.g. as in primates
[26,27]). Finally, we examine the possibility of increased zoo-
notic viruses at low latitudes, as Jones et al. proposed a link
between latitude and risk of zoonotic emergence [3].

In addition to host traits, viral traits affect spillover and
emergence of zoonoses: RNA viruses are more likely to
emerge than DNA viruses [28], and replication in the cyto-
plasm was the best predictor of cross-species transmission
from livestock to humans [29]. Therefore, we also explore
some basic characteristics of viruses found in bats and rodents.
2. Material and methods
(a) Viral data
We compiled databases of viruses in bats or rodents and the
species in which each has been detected by searching Thomson
Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science (http://apps.webofknow
ledge.com/) for each rodent and bat genus ‘AND virus’ (under
‘Topic’) through the year 2011. Viruses were grouped at the
species level, based on the International Committee on the Tax-
onomy of Viruses database. Host taxonomy conforms to
Wilson & Reader’s Mammal Species of the World [30]. These data-
bases are included in the electronic supplementary material.
Viruses were classified as zoonotic or non-zoonotic; RNA or
DNA; replicating in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and whether
they consist of a single segment or multiple segments. Viruses
and hosts that were not identified to species were not included
in the analyses. More than double the number of viruses are
known for Mus musculus than for any other rodent species, as
a consequence of its use as a laboratory animal and the donor
of many cell lines. For example, minute virus of mice was discov-
ered as a contaminant in the experimental stock of a different
virus when grown in a mouse cell line [31]. Therefore, this
host species was removed from analyses, because preliminary
analyses identified it as a high leverage point.

(b) Species trait data
For as many host species in our viral database as possible, we
compiled data for the following traits (see the electronic sup-
plementary material, table S14 and figures S4–S8): adult body
mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year, litter
size, torpor use, migration (bats only), International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conservation status, species geo-
graphical distribution area, latitude of the midpoint (centroid) of
the species distribution, number of other species in the same
taxonomic order that are sympatric, number of citations on
Web of Science. Data were obtained from an online database
of mammalian traits (http://www.utheria.com) [32] on body
mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per year and litter

size. Additional values were compiled from the literature (see the
electronic supplementary material, table S14 for values and refer-
ences) and the AnAge database (http://genomics.senescence.
info/species/) [33]. Torpor expression was treated as a categori-
cal variable with three categories: (i) no evidence of torpor
use, (ii) some torpor use, but not true hibernation (minimum
body temperature � 118C), and (iii) true hibernation (body
temperature , 118C) [34].

Species sampling intensity was represented by the logged
number of Web of Science citations for the binomial species
name (and commonly used synonyms) in quotations. IUCN con-
servation status, species distributions and longitude and latitude
coordinates for the centroids of the distributions were obtained
from the IUCN website (http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-
documents/spatial-data) [35]. The IUCN has seven conservation
status categories: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable,
endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct.
The first three categories described all the bats in our analysis, and
‘least concern’ and ‘vulnerable’ described all the rodents in our
analysis. Using the shape files from the IUCN website and the
command ‘over’ from the R packages ‘sp’ and ‘rgeos’ [36,37], for
each species in the analysis, we calculated how many other species
in the same taxonomic order had species ranges that overlapped
with its own, referred to here as sympatry. This included every
species of bat or rodent for which IUCN had distribution shape
files (1150 species of bat and 2216 of rodent).

We follow Fleming & Eby [38, p. 157] in defining migration
in bats as ‘a seasonal, usually two-way movement from one
place or habitat to another to avoid unfavorable climatic con-
ditions and/or to seek more favorable energetic conditions’. In
most cases, these are regular annual movements that vary with
predictable seasonal changes in temperature (for temperate
zone bats) or rainfall (tropical bats). We did not consider records
of one-way movements or dispersal as evidence for migration.
We categorized migratory status of bats as: (i) species that can
be broadly categorized as sedentary or only local (approx. less
than 100 km) migrants, (ii) species that can be generalized as
regional migrants (approx. 100–500 km), and (iii) species that
can be categorized as long-distance migrants (greater than 500
km). This information was compiled from the literature, with
species reported to be present in an area year-round considered
evidence for category 1.
(c) Analysis
We used generalized least squares (GLS) to examine host trait
correlates of zoonotic viral richness per host species, while con-
trolling for phylogeny as described below. To examine whether
bats host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses per
host species than rodents, with and without taking into account
sampling intensity, we used generalized linear models (GLMs)
with negative binomial errors.

Because many life-history traits are correlated, we performed
principal components analyses (PCA) on the life-history traits:
logged body mass, maximum longevity, number of litters per
year and litter size. We performed three PCAs, one for bats
(PCb), one for rodents (PCr) and one for the bats and rodents com-
bined (PCrb). The variables were rescaled to have unit variance
before analysis in R using the ‘prcomp’ function [36], and these
principal components were then used in subsequent analyses.

To determine if the number of zoonotic viruses or total
number of viruses hosted by a species is significantly correlated
to species traits, we performed GLS models for bats and rodents
separately, then on the combined bat and rodent data. Because
closely related species share traits, we tested for phylogenetic
dependence using a GLS framework to allow for correlation
structure in the error term. The ‘APE’ package [39] in R [36]
was used to calculate a phylogenetic correlation matrix in
which each entry was a pairwise correlation between each pair
of species based on their shared branch lengths of a mammalian
phylogenetic supertree [40]. The subsets of the phylogenetic tree
that we used are shown in the electronic supplementary material,
figures S2 and S3. The error term for the GLS was set to this cor-
relation matrix multiplied by an additional parameter, Pagel’s l,
that was estimated (using ‘optim’ in R) to determine the strength
of phylogenetic dependence [41,42]. A l estimate of one indicates
that the error structure of the model was directly proportional
to the species shared branch lengths. A l estimate of zero indi-
cates that the error structure of the model was not related to
the species shared branch lengths (e.g. phylogeny does not
explain any additional variation), and the correlation matrix is
not included in the model. Models were ranked by their
Akaike information criterion with a correction for finite sample
sizes (AICc) values. Correlation coefficients (R) were obtained
by using Pearson’s product moment correlation comparing the
observed number of viruses to model predictions.

Chi-squared (x2) tests were used to examine which viral
traits, such as type of nucleic acid, genomic segmentation and
site of replication were associated with zoonotic infection and
taxonomic order.
3. Results
Bats host, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per
species than rodents (tables 1 and 2). The response variable,
zoonotic viral richness (i.e. number of zoonotic viruses per
host species), was significantly greater for bats than rodents
after controlling for the significant effect of sampling effort
(i.e. order and number of citations were in the best model
by AICc; table 1). However, as there are approximately
twice as many species of rodent as species of bat, the overall
number of zoonotic viruses was fewer in bats (61) than in
rodents (68). Twenty-four viruses were present in both bats
and rodents, of which 21 were zoonotic. Viruses (both zoono-
tic and non-zoonotic) had a broader host range in bats,
averaging 4.51 bat host species per virus, whereas rodent
viruses averaged 2.76, which was significantly different by
t-test (t ¼ 2.17, p ¼ 0.031; table 2).

Species trait data were available for 66 species of bat and
81 species of rodent (out of 413 species totally). This subset of
bat and rodent species had 46 and 53 zoonotic viruses,
respectively, which accounted for more than 75 per cent of
the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in both orders.

(a) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection
in rodents

The first three principal components accounted for 93 per
cent of the variance in rodent life-history strategies. PC1r
separated r-selected species (larger litter size, more litters
per year, shorter lifespan) from K-selected species (lower
reproductive rates and greater mass and longevity; electronic
supplementary material, figure S1a x-axis and table S1). PC2r
separated reproductive strategies for a given number of
offspring per year (litters per year versus litter size;
electronic supplementary material, figure S1a y-axis and
table S1). PC3r separated species with lower or higher values
for all of the life-history traits (bigger, longer lived, higher
reproduction; electronic supplementary material, table S1).

Two models tied for the best model by AICc in GLS
analyses examining correlates of zoonotic viral richness
in rodents (see the electronic supplementary material,
table S2). Both models included the logged number of cita-
tions and rodent sympatry, with one model containing
IUCN conservation status. The number of citations was
positively correlated with viral richness. Rodent sympatry
was also positively correlated to zoonotic viral richness,
i.e. rodent species whose distributions overlapped with a
greater number of other rodent species had more zoonotic
viruses. Rodents with an IUCN status of ‘vulnerable’
hosted fewer zoonotic viruses than those listed as ‘least
concern’. Phylogeny did not explain additional variation: for
every model, l , 1 � 10211. Figure 1a shows the ranking of
variables by their DAICc values on removal or addition
(compared with the best model).

(b) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection in bats
The first three principal components accounted for 88 per
cent of the variance in bat life-history strategies. Negative
values of PC1b indicated species with a greater litter size,
and positive values indicated species with higher mass and
longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1b x-axis and table S3). PC2b
separated species with more litters per year from those with
higher longevity (see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S1b y-axis and table S3). PC3b separated species
with larger litters and mass from those with higher longe-
vity and litters per year (see the electronic supplementary
material, table S3).
The best model examining correlates of viral richness in
bats by AICc included (in order of importance by DAICc)
bat sympatry, the logged number of citations, and PC1b
accounting for 78.7 per cent of the model weight (see
the electronic supplementary material, table S4). The posi-
tive coefficient of PC1b in the top ranked model indicated
that bats with smaller litter size, larger body mass, greater
longevity and more litters per year (see the electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1b, x-axis) are more likely to
have more zoonotic viruses. Similar to our findings for
rodents, sampling effort and sympatry were positively corre-
lated to zoonotic viral richness. In models that did not
include sympatry, phylogeny explained additional variation
(l estimates ranged up to 0.29). For all the models that
included sympatry, l , 0.001, indicating phylogeny did not
explain additional variation once sympatry was taken into
account. The importance of the different variables ranked
by DAICc is shown in figure 1b.
(c) Species trait correlates of zoonotic infection across
both bats and rodents

PC1rb of the combined data largely separated bats from
rodents and accounted for 51.1 per cent of the variance in
life-history traits (see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S9 and table S5). PC2rb, PC3rb and PC4rb largely
described body mass, litters per year and longevity, and
litter size and longevity, respectively (see the electronic
supplementary material, figure S9 and table S5).

All four PCs were used in the GLS models that controlled
for phylogeny to account for relatively small differences in
life-history traits. The best model for the combined data
included, in order of importance, citations, taxonomic
order, taxon sympatry, the interaction between order and
sympatry and torpor use (table 3 and figure 1c). Again, bats
hosted more zoonotic viruses per species and the effect of
sympatry for bats was 3.9 times higher than for rodents.
Torpor use was negatively correlated to zoonotic viral rich-
ness (see the electronic supplementary material, table S7),
and there was some weight for a negative effect of latitude
(table 3). Phylogeny did not explain any additional variation
(l, 0.01).
(d) Species trait correlates of total viral infections
The species trait correlates of total viral infections were
similar to those for zoonotic infections. (see the electronic
supplementary material, tables S8–S10.) The best rodent
model included citations, rodent sympatry and torpor. The
best bat model and the best model for the combined data
were the same as for zoonotic viruses.

(e) Viral traits associated with zoonotic infection
Using x2 tests, we compared zoonotic with non-zoonotic
viruses. The zoonotic viruses in our database were much
more likely to be RNA viruses (x2 ¼ 42.7, p , 0.001), have
multiple segments (x2=12.3, p , 0.001) and replicate in the
cytoplasm (x2 ¼ 41.8, p , 0.001; electronic supplementary
material, table S11), compared with non-zoonotic viruses.
From the host perspective, bats harbored a higher proportion
of unsegmented genome viruses compared with rodents
(x2 ¼ 6.89, p ¼ 0.008; electronic supplementary material, table
S12), but no significant differences were detected in replication
site or nucleic acid, and no significant differences were present
if comparing only zoonotic viruses of bats and rodents.
4. Discussion
It has been suggested that bats may be unique in hosting
many emerging zoonotic viruses [6,7]. We found that bats
indeed host a significantly greater number of zoonotic viruses
per species compared with rodents. Additionally, using a
trait-based approach, we identified important life-history
and ecological predictors of zoonotic viral richness for both
bats and rodents, and identified viral traits that were strongly
associated with zoonotic infection.

Sympatry within taxonomic order appeared to be the
most important host trait associated with zoonotic viral rich-
ness, other than sampling effort as reflected in number of
citations. In previous studies, sympatry was also found to
be an important predictor of sharing of rabies virus variants
among bats [43] and viruses among primates [26]. We show
that the effect of sympatry was 3.9 times stronger for bats
than for rodents. Although there are fewer range overlaps
in bats, perhaps a consequence of there being approximately
half the number of bat species as rodent species, there
appears to be a greater impact on the number of zoonotic
viruses per host when sympatry does occur, suggesting that
viruses may be transmitted more easily between sympatric
bat species than between sympatric rodent species. One poss-
ible contributing factor is the level of interspecific contacts
among bats when compared with rodents because many
bat roosts have a diverse assemblage of bat species [14,15],
whereas rodent species typically do not share communal
nesting sites. However, high contact rates alone are

insufficient for cross-species transmission because host and/or
virus traits also determine the ability of a virus to infect new
host species. For example, the level of physiological similarity
across sympatric bat species could affect the ability of viruses
adapted to any of the sympatric species to spillover into
others (which may be why phylogeny was also an important
factor in viral sharing of rabies virus variants [43]). The general-
ity of viral infection traits are probably also important and
could allow non-specific viruses to take advantage of multiple
host species in close contact. Here, we examined viral richness,
but further examination of which viruses are shared among
which hosts and their characteristics is warranted and may
shed more light on this question.

The importance of PC1b for bats indicated that bat species
with smaller litter size, greater body mass, longevity and
more litters per year, tended to host more zoonotic viruses.
Rodents have a broad range of reproductive strategies, but
in bats, litter size is negatively correlated with the number
of litters per year (Pearson’s product moment correlation,
p ¼ 0.024). No bat species consistently has more than three
offspring per year, but at lower latitudes (less than 208),
there is some variation as to how these offspring are distrib-
uted throughout the year. Our analyses suggest that species
which spread births over the year host more zoonotic viruses.
A potential physiological explanation is the trade-off between
immune function and reproduction. Sex hormones can
modulate immunocompetence and affect disease resistance
genes and behaviour that may make individuals more sus-
ceptible to infection [44]. A potential ecological explanation
is the replenishment of the susceptible pool from births.
Immunizing, horizontally transmitted infections with a high
R0 (basic reproductive number) are vulnerable to ‘burn-out’
after an epidemic when the number of susceptible hosts
drops below the level needed to sustain an epidemic. More
litters per year could mean a more continual replenishment
of susceptible individuals.

Increased zoonotic viral richness with host longevity is at
odds with the ‘pace of life’ hypothesis, which proposes that
short-lived animals put less energy into adaptive immunity
in favour of more general immune responses (like broad bac-
terial recognition), which may make them more competent
reservoir hosts [45]. The competency of Lyme disease hosts,
for example, seems to follow this pattern [46], but there
appears to be mixed evidence for this more generally [47].
This hypothesis also does not consider pathogen traits.
Viruses that cause chronic or persistent infections would
have higher fitness in a longer-lived host because of the
increased infectious period. Therefore, how the pace of a
host’s life affects reservoir potential may be a function of
traits of the virus, host and/or the virus–host interaction.

We hypothesized that torpor use would be positively cor-
related to viral richness since torpor expression was identified
as a key factor in rabies perpetuation in big brown bats
(Eptesicus fuscus) in Colorado [48], and viral titers can peak
upon arousal from hibernation [10]. However, we found
torpor was negatively correlated to viral richness. One poten-
tial explanation is reduced exposure to viruses owing to
lower contact rates during torpor. More research is needed
to determine the relationship between torpor, host compe-
tence as related to within-host viral persistence and
population viral perpetuation processes.

For both bats and rodents, the number of citations was a
positive indicator for viruses identified. It is commonly found
that the number of pathogens recorded per species is positively
correlated with sampling effort, even for well-studied species
[26,49,50], indicating that the current estimates of viral richness
are probably substantial underestimates. Hence, there may be
many more viruses in both bats and rodents with the potential
to spillover into humans. Although distribution area was not in
the best models, this could be confounded by the finding that
area was positively correlated to the number of citations (see
the electronic supplementary material, figure S8)—widespread
species are more often studied. Widespread species could
also have more contact with humans, perhaps facilitating
more frequent spillover of pathogens.

We did not see a significant effect of phylogeny in most
models (l was near zero). However, l indicates only the
amount of residual variation that can be explained by phylo-
geny after the variables are taken into account. Even though
we found little effect of phylogeny in our overall models,
when considered individually, all variables examined were
correlated to phylogeny to some extent, in at least one of
the two groups (see the electronic supplementary material,
table S13), suggesting phylogenetic relationships are
probably more important than indicated by the models.

Overall, our analyses have explained approximately 43
per cent of the variation seen in zoonotic viral richness
among hosts. Although we show that zoonotic viral richness
of bats and rodents is significantly different, a majority of the
variance in the number of zoonotic viruses per host species is
still unexplained, leaving room for multiple alternative expla-
nations. Although sympatry is a good predictor of zoonotic
viral richness, our findings suggest high species diversity
alone [6] is not the reason for bats hosting a high number
of zoonotic viruses. Rodents, the mammalian order with
the greatest number of species (twice the number of bat
species), were found to host only seven more zoonotic viruses
than bats, and rodents host fewer zoonotic viruses per species
than bats. It has been hypothesized that because bats are evo-
lutionarily ancient mammals, viruses that evolved with bats
may use cellular receptors that have been conserved in mam-
mals, enhancing the ability to transmit to other mammals,
including humans [6,51]. However, rodents are evolutionarily
older than bats and more closely related to humans [52–54]. If
cell receptor evolutionary patterns follow whole genome evol-
utionary patterns, cell receptors between humans and rodents
should be more similar than between humans and bats. While
it was beyond the scope of this paper to examine qualitative
or quantitative differences in immunity between bats and
rodents, such differences may play a role in viral establish-
ment and perpetuation within host populations. We were
also unable to address directly the hypothesis that flight
helps disperse viruses [6]. However, we found that migration
in bats did not predict a higher number of zoonotic viruses.
One factor that we were not able to quantify but which is
probably important for the ecology and evolution of viruses
and other pathogens is the degree of sociality or coloniality
of the host. Although many bat species are known to be colo-
nial, a number of species are solitary or nearly so for at least
part of the annual cycle. Moreover, the roosting behaviour
and social structure of many other species is virtually
unknown. Thus, we were not able to quantify coloniality
reliably for the species in our analysis at this time, and we
recommend future studies incorporate this variable.

The viral traits we found to be associated with zoonotic
infection were consistent with those identified by studies

of other taxa. Zoonotic viruses in bats and rodents were over-
whelmingly RNA viruses that have multiple segments and
replicate in the cytoplasm. These results are similar to those
previously published for domestic livestock: for example, the
ability to complete replication within the cytoplasm was the
single best predictor of whether livestock viruses can infect
humans, with a multiple-segmented genome also being a
good predictor [29]. Other studies have shown that RNA
viruses are more likely to cause emerging infectious diseases
than DNA viruses, whether from livestock or from other
mammals, such as carnivores [28]. These viral traits shed
light on mechanisms of pathogen emergence and spillover.
Viruses with RNA and/or multiple-segmented genomes may
be more likely to generate genetic diversity with replication,
through mutation and reassortment, increasing the chance of
zoonotic viral emergence. Additionally, the ability to replicate
in the cytoplasm may allow greater chance of spillover to new
hosts (including humans) through bypassing the need to inter-
act with the complex cell machinery (which is probably highly
host-specific) needed to enter the nucleus for replication.

As this study is based on a large literature search, there are
necessarily constraints on inference, given different motiv-
ations for, and methods used during studies of both rodent
and bat viruses through time. However, our analysis of cita-
tions and the interactions between order and citations
suggest that the interaction only has 12 per cent weight (see
electronic supplementary material, 4th model, table S6), thus
suggesting that the effect of sampling effort was not substan-
tially different between the two orders (with the exception of
Mus musculus, removed from the analyses; see §2). Another
potential source of bias may be reports of incidental or spil-
lover hosts that are not important reservoirs but are treated
with equal weight in these analyses. Furthermore, although
we show that bats have more viruses per species, we cannot
say with these analyses which species or orders are likely to
be more important in spreading these viruses to humans. Dis-
entangling these factors is difficult at present. Therefore, our
results should be viewed with some caution. Recent advances
in metagenomic and molecular studies may shed light on
some of these issues and alter our understanding of human–
rodent and human–bat cross-species transmission [55–57].
Since we did not examine other host groups that are important
reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, e.g. primates, ungulates, carni-
vores and birds, the importance of bats in comparison with
other groups remains an open question. We chose rodents as
a suitable first comparison because bats and rodents are
more similar in life-history traits than other host groups. For
example, non-human primates are indeed important reservoir
hosts, however, their close phylogenetic relationship with
humans, less overlap of life-history traits with bats, and the
multiple examples of humans transmitting viruses to primates,
such as measles and mumps [58,59] add additional confound-
ing variables. However, further comparative analyses
examining a broader range of host groups are warranted.
This study provides evidence that bats are indeed special
in at least one regard—they host more zoonotic viruses and
more total viruses per species than rodents. However,
because there is approximately twice the number of rodent
species as bat species, the overall number of zoonotic viruses
identified in bats was lower than in rodents. Therefore,
rodents should remain a serious concern as reservoirs for
future zoonotic disease emergence. This study additionally
identifies several specific traits that appear to promote viral
richness across taxonomic orders. Given the importance of
sympatry in our analysis, future analyses should aim to
determine the relative effects of phylogeny and sympatry
more broadly in animal reservoirs of emerging zoonoses. Fur-
thermore, our analyses support the theory that traits of
zoonotic viruses are also important in determining prob-
ability of spillover. Both sympatry and viral traits may act
together, with the ability to replicate in the cytoplasm and
bypass additional host-specific cell machinery potentially
allowing viruses to more easily pass between sympatric
species in the same taxonomic order, which could be com-
pounded by increased rates of interspecific contact. Our
results, therefore, point to this as a newly hypothesized
mechanism to explain, at least in part, how bats host more
zoonotic viruses per species. Interspecific transmission may
be more prevalent in bats than in rodents (or other orders).
This is supported by the most recent molecular studies that
indicate there has been a greater number of host switches
of paramyxoviruses from bats to other mammals than from
rodents, birds, primates, carnivores and cetartiodactyls [55].
Interspecific transmission and spillover is one of the least
studied aspects of disease ecology and should therefore be
a focus of further studies. Mechanisms of transmission of
viruses among bat species may be different than transmission
from bats to humans. The mechanisms of interspecific trans-
fer of pathogens, particularly to humans, remain poorly
understood, but in some cases are complex and involve inter-
mediate hosts. Gaining understanding of actual mechanisms
of such pathogen transfer should be an active area of research
in order to develop evidence-based policies to minimize
risks, while conserving bats and the irreplaceable ecosystem
services they provide.

ABSTRACT: We captured 140 bats of seven
species in Merida City in the Yucatan Peninsula
of Mexico in 2010. Serum was collected from
each bat and assayed by plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) using six flavivirus-
es: West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus,
and dengue viruses 1–4. Flavivirus-specific
antibodies were detected in 26 bats (19%).
The antibody-positive bats belonged to three
species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat (Glosso-
phaga soricina), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus
jamaicensis), and great fruit-eating bat (Arti-
beus lituratus), and their flavivirus antibody
prevalences were 33%, 24%, and 9%, respec-
tively. The PRNT titers were usually highest for
dengue virus 2 or dengue virus 4, but none
of the titers exceeded 80. These data could
indicate that most of the antibody-positive bats
had been infected with dengue virus. However,
because all titers were low, it is possible that the
bats had been infected with another (perhaps
unrecognized) flavivirus not included in the
PRNT analysis, possibly a virus more closely
related to dengue virus than to other flavivirus-
es. Each serum sample was assayed for
flavivirus RNA by reverse transcription PCR,
but all were negative.

Key words: Bats, Chiroptera, dengue vi-
rus, flavivirus, Mexico, surveillance.

Bats are one of the most abundant and
geographically widespread groups of ver-
tebrates. There are 1,116 recognized
species of bats and they inhabit every
continent (except Antarctica) and almost
every ecosystem (Wilson and Reeder,
2005; Calisher et al., 2006). Bats are often
found in areas inhabited by humans and
harbor a diverse range of viruses of
medical importance, including filoviruses,
SARS-like and other coronaviruses, heni-
paviruses, and lyssaviruses.

Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus
(WNV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus
(SLEV) are recognized human pathogens
in the genus Flavivirus, family Flavivir-
idae. The role of bats in the transmission
and ecology of DENV, WNV, and SLEV is
not well understood, but several studies
have demonstrated that bats of some
species are susceptible to infection by
these viruses (Sulkin et al., 1966; Paul et
al., 1970; de Thoisy et al., 2009). Dengue
virus exists as four serotypes (DENV-1 to
DENV-4), and all are present in the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (Lorono-
Pino et al., 2004). Serologic data indicate
that WNV and SLEV also occur in this
region (Farfan-Ale et al., 2006). Never-
theless, there is no information on the
infection or prevalence of antibody to
these viruses or any other flaviviruses in
bats in the Yucatan Peninsula. Dengue
virus–specific nucleic acid and antibodies
were detected in bats in the nearby states
of Veracruz, and DENV-specific antibod-
ies were detected in bats in the states of
Colima and Jalisco in southwest Mexico
(Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). No other
investigators have examined whether fla-
viviruses infect bats in Mexico. Our goal
was to determine the occurrence of
selected flaviviruses in bats in Merida,
the largest city in the Yucatan Peninsula.

We collected whole blood from 140
free-ranging bats captured using mist nets
at five study sites, July–October 2010. One
site was within the central business district
(CBD); the other four were directly to the
north, south, east, or west of the CBD.
The site within the CBD was in the

Parque Zoologico El Centenario (Merida
zoo; 20u5897.60N, 89u38926.00W). The
northern site (Santa Gertrudis Copo;
21u02934.90N, 89u35930.10W) was on a
private property containing a sheep pen,
an enclosure of chickens, low scrub, and
sparse trees. The southern site (Parque
Metropolitano; 20u53950.80N, 89u39931.10W)
was established in a public park with
abundant trees and other vegetation and
three small caves. The eastern site (Acua-
parque; 20u56950.80N, 89u34940.40W) was
in a public park containing a manmade
lake, recreational facilities, low scrub, and
native grasses. The western site (Parque
Hundido; 20u58936.80N, 89u39928.50W)
was a public park with numerous trees,
native grasses, and several ponds.

We trapped four nights a week (one site
per night) using three mist nets (632 m
with 16-mm mesh openings) at each site.
Nets were placed over water, along
fruiting trees, and at the entrances of
caves whenever possible. Nets were set
from dusk (,7:00 PM) until 11:00 PM.
Captured bats were placed in cloth bags
until processed. Bats were identified to
species, age class (juvenile or adult), and
sex (Medellı́n et al., 1997). Taxonomy
followed Wilson and Reeder (2005). Ap-
proximately 100 mL of blood was collected
from each bat by nonlethal cardiac punc-
ture or from the ulnar vein. Blood samples
were diluted 10-fold using phosphate-
buffered saline containing 0.75% bovine
albumin fraction V, 500 units/mL penicil-
lin, 500 mg/mL streptomycin, and 12.5 mg/
mL amphotericin, and placed on ice.
Samples were transported to the labora-
tory, centrifuged, and stored at 270 C.

Sera were assayed by plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) following stan-
dard methods (Beaty et al., 1995). The
PRNTs were done using WNV (strain
NY99-35261-11), SLEV (strain TBH-28),
DENV-1 (strain Hawaii), DENV-2 (strain
New Guinea C), DENV-3 (strain H-87),
and DENV-4 (strain H-241). The PRNTs
were performed in six-well plates contain-
ing confluent monolayers of African green

monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Sera were
initially tested at a dilution of 1:20, and
those that reduced the number of plaques
by $70% were titrated. Titers were
expressed as the reciprocal of serum
dilutions yielding $90% reduction in the
number of plaques (PRNT90). Mouse
hyperimmune ascitic fluids containing
antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and DENV1–
4 were used as positive controls and sera
from uninfected mice served as negative
controls.

Sera were also assayed by reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for flavivirus
RNA. Briefly, 100 mL of each serum
sample was added to 0.9 mL of Trizol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA)
and total RNA was extracted in accor-
dance with the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Complementary DNAs were gener-
ated using Superscript III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random
hexamer primers (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The
PCRs were performed using Taq poly-
merase (Invitrogen) and flavivirus-specific
primers that target an ,800-nucleotide
region of NS5 gene (Maher-Sturgess et al.,
2008). The RT-PCR products were exam-
ined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis
and visualized with ethidium bromide.

We captured 140 bats belonging to two
families, five subfamilies, and seven species
(Table 1). The most highly represented
species were the Jamaican fruit bat (Arti-
beus jamaicensis) and great fruit-eating bat
(Artibeus lituratus), which comprised 56%
and 23% of captures, respectively. Eighty-
nine (64%) bats were adults and 51 (36%)
were juveniles. Fifty-nine bats were
trapped in Parque Hundido, 42 in Parque
Metropolitano, 21 in Acuaparque, 14 in the
Merida zoo, and four in Santa Gertrudis
Copo. All bats were nonmigratory and
appeared healthy.

Twenty-six bats (19%) had evidence of
flavivirus infection (Tables 1 and 2). The
bats with antibodies belonged to three
species: the Pallas’s long-tongued bat
(Glossophaga soricina), Jamaican fruit

bat, and great fruit-eating bat. The species
with the highest flavivirus antibody prev-
alence was the Pallas’s long-tongued bat
(33%). Antibody prevalences for the
Jamaican fruit bat and great fruit-eating
bat were 24% and 9%, respectively.
Fifteen (58%) of the bats with flavivirus-
specific antibodies were adults; 11 (42%)
were juveniles.

The PRNT90 titers were usually highest
for DENV-2 or DENV-4, although all of
the titers could be considered low because
none exceeded 80 (Table 2). Low anti-
body titers were also observed in bats from
Costa Rica and Ecuador; these bats were
assayed by PRNT using all serotypes of
DENV and none had titers (when ex-
pressed as PRNT80) above 80 (Platt et al.,
2000). Likewise, low antibody titers were
detected in bats from China that were
assayed by microseroneutralization test
using Japanese encephalitis virus (Cui et
al., 2008).

Our PRNT data could indicate that
most of the flavivirus-antibody–positive
bats had been exposed to DENV but high
levels of neutralizing antibodies were not
generated because DENV replicates inef-
ficiently in chiropterans. Another potential
explanation is that efficient DENV repli-
cation does occur in bats but the titers
were low because bats do not produce
high levels of neutralizing antibodies in
response to DENV infection. In this
regard, neutralizing antibodies to WNV

were not detected in any bats following
WNV inoculation, even though some were
viremic (Davis et al., 2005). Experimental
infection studies should be performed to
assess the viremia profiles and antibody
responses in bats after DENV inoculation.
Flavivirus-specific neutralizing antibodies
have been shown to persist at low titers in
some vertebrate species long after the
initial exposure (Gibbs et al., 2005), and
therefore another explanation is that some
of the infections were not recent. How-
ever, this is probably not a major reason
because 42% of the flavivirus-antibody–
positive bats were juveniles. A more likely
reason is that the majority (if not all) of the
antibody-positive bats were infected with
another, perhaps unrecognized, flavivirus
not included in the PRNTs and that the
low titers are due to serologic cross-
reactivity. Flaviviruses have a close anti-
genic relationship and therefore neutraliz-
ing antibodies to one flavivirus often cross-
react with heterologous flaviviruses (Cal-
isher et al., 1989). Other flaviviruses known
to infect bats include Rio Bravo virus
(RBV) and Tamana bat virus (Allen et al.,
1970; Price, 1978). Additional flaviviruses
were not included in the PRNTs because
many of the bats were small and the volume
of sera available was limited.

As stated earlier, 19% of bats had
flavivirus-neutralizing antibody. Similar
flavivirus antibody prevalences have been
reported for bats elsewhere in Latin

America. In a serosurvey performed in
Guatemala, 19% of bats had antibodies
that neutralized RBV (Ubico and McLean,
1995). Evidence of flavivirus infection was
detected in 23% of bats in Costa Rica that
were assayed by PRNT using all DENV
serotypes (Platt et al., 2000). Higher
antibody prevalence (30%) was observed
in bats in Ecuador. However, in the
studies described above, titers were ex-
pressed as PRNT80, and therefore the
reported antibody prevalences would have
presumably been slightly lower if the more
stringent PRNT90 had been used. In
another study, 12% of bats in Colima,
Jalisco, and Veracruz, Mexico, had anti-
bodies that reacted with DENV antigen by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008).

We did not detect flavivirus RNA by RT-
PCR in any of the sera. Evidence of
flavivirus infection has been demonstrated
in bats assayed by RT-PCR in other studies
(Zhang et al., 1998; Aguilar-Setien et al.,
2008; de Thoisy et al., 2009). For example,
DENV-2 RNA was detected in heart tissues
from three species of bats in Veracruz
(Aguilar-Setien et al., 2008). A notable
difference between our study and the
others cited here is that our RT-PCRs were
performed using sera rather than tissues.
Approval to perform terminal bleeds and
harvest was not granted for our study.

We have provided serologic evidence
that flaviviruses infect bats of some species
in the Yucatan Peninsula. Our PRNT
titers were often highest for DENV, but,
because all of the titers were low, many (if
not all) of these bats could have been
infected with a flavivirus not included in
the PRNTs. Experimental infection stud-
ies are needed to assess the potential of
bats to serve as amplifying hosts of DENV.
These experiments would also provide
valuable information on the viremia pro-
files and antibody responses in bats after
DENV inoculation. Such data would
facilitate the interpretation of PRNT data
obtained in flavivirus serosurveys among
free-ranging bats.

Impacts

• Flaviviruses of southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia
comprise at least 30 viruses, ranging from major pathogens such as

Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis

(MVE), and the four dengue viruses, to other viruses which either cause

minor human febrile diseases or have not been associated with human

disease.

• Flaviviruses have been shown to have a propensity to spread, emerge and
establish in new geographic areas, and thus any member may have the

potential to emerge unexpectedly anywhere if suitable vectors and

vertebrate hosts occur.

• Most members of the genus have little or no known association with
human or animal diseases, but they may all have an inherent potential to

be more pathogenic in the future – indeed, with flaviviruses, one should

expect the unexpected, they are unpredictable with respect to disease

severity, unusual clinical manifestations, and unexpected methods of

transmission.

• Phylogenetic studies suggest JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses may have derived
from an ancestral African flavivirus and evolved in the Indo-Malay area

to subsequently disperse throughout their geographic ranges, whereas WN

virus probably evolved in Africa, and different genetic lineages spread to

Australasia (lineage 1b), India (lineages 1a and 5), Malaysia (a newly

identified lineage 6). In addition, a separate lineage evolved in Africa to

become the closely related Koutango virus (lineage 7).

• Novel flaviviruses have emerged in the region, including New Mapoon
virus in northern Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus

from Thailand, which demonstrates that new flaviviruses might be found

in different ecosystems.

Summary

The genus Flaviviridae comprises about 70 members, of which about 30 are

found in southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia. These

include major pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN),

Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), tick-borne encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest

disease virus, and the dengue viruses. Other members are known to be associ-

ated with mild febrile disease in humans, or with no known disease. In addi-

tion, novel flaviviruses continue to be discovered, as demonstrated recently by

New Mapoon virus in Australia, Sitiawan virus in Malaysia, and ThCAr virus

in Thailand. About 19 of these viruses are mosquito-borne, six are tick-borne,

and four have no known vector and represent isolates from rodents or bats.

Introduction

The family Flaviviridae comprises three genera; the Flavi-

virus genus, the Pestivirus genus, and the Hepacivirus

genus. The viruses are 40–60 nm in diameter, spherical in

shape, and contain a lipid envelope. All members of the

family have a genome composed of a single molecule of

linear positive-sense RNA, ranging in size from about

9.6 kb for Hepaciviruses, to 11 kb for Flaviviruses, and

12.3 kb for Pestiviruses. Members of each genus are sero-

logically related to each other, but not to members of the

other genera (Thiel et al., 2005). The Pestiviruses infect

pigs and ruminants, but are not zoonotic. The major

members of the genus include Bovine diarrhoeal disease

virus and Classical swine fever virus. Hepaciviruses com-

prise the hepatitis C viruses and only infect humans.

Thus, these two genera will not be discussed further.

The Flavivirus Genus

The Flavivirus genus comprises over 70 members (Thiel

et al., 2005). The type species is yellow fever virus from

which the genus (and family) name is derived (flavus,

Latin for ‘yellow’). Members of the genus Flaviviruses are

found widely dispersed throughout the world on all con-

tinents except Antarctica. Most are transmitted by an

arthropod vector, either mosquitoes or ticks, but a few

viruses have no known vector species. The most impor-

tant mosquito-borne viruses are yellow fever virus, which

is found in west, central and east Africa and tropical

South America; Japanese encephalitis (JE) which is found

in east, south-east and southern Asia, and in northern

Australasia (Mackenzie et al., 2007); West Nile (WN)

virus which is found in Africa, the Middle East, Europe,

southern Asia, Australasia, and most recently, in North

America and now spreading into Central and South

America (Kramer et al., 2007; Blitvich, 2008); and dengue

viruses which are found throughout much of tropical and

subtropical regions of the world. In addition, Murray

Valley encephalitis (MVE) and St Louis encephalitis (SLE)

are the major encephalitic viruses in their respective geo-

graphic regions, Australasia and the Americas respectively.

The most important tick-borne virus is Tick-borne

encephalitis (TBE) virus which is found in central Europe

and across the central and northern Asian continent.

Others are important regionally, such as Kyasanur Forest

disease (KFD) virus in India. There are approximately 39

mosquito-borne members of the genus, 15 tick-borne

members, and 17 with no known vector. The major crite-

ria for determining the groupings of species and members

within the genus are nucleotide and deduced amino acid

sequence data, antigenic relationships, vector association

and geographic incidence (Calisher and Gould, 2003;

Thiel et al., 2005).

The mosquito-borne viruses have been grouped into

seven groups: the Aroa virus group with four members,

the JE virus group with 10 members, the Ntaya virus

group with six members, the Kokobera virus group with

two members, the Dengue virus group with five members,

the Spondweni virus group with two members, and the

Yellow fever virus group with 10 members (Thiel et al.,

2005). Some members are defined as subspecies (e.g.

Kunjin virus as a subspecies of WN virus, and Alfuy virus

as a subspecies of MVE virus), however, the interpreta-

tion of the criteria for assigning a species level, and the

definition of what constitutes a subspecies may be contro-

versial. Thus, Kunjin virus is clearly a WN virus and a

member of WN lineage 1, although forming a distinct

clade, lineage 1b (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002), and Alfuy

virus has recently been fully sequenced and is also clearly

a separate species (May et al., 2006).

The tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprise 12 spe-

cies divided into two groups, the mammalian and seabird

groups, with two of the mammalian species comprising

an additional seven subtypes (Thiel et al., 2005). In the

mammalian tick-borne group, six species are capable of

Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggest that JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses

probably emerged in the Malaya-Indonesian region from an African progenitor

virus, possibly a virus related to Usutu virus. WN virus, however, is believed to

have emerged in Africa, and then dispersed through avian migration. Evidence

suggests that there are at least seven genetic lineages of WN virus, of which

lineage 1b spread to Australasia as Kunjin virus, lineages 1a and 5 spread to

India, and lineage 6 spread to Malaysia. Indeed, flaviviruses have a propensity

to spread and emerge in new geographic areas, and they represent a potential

source for new disease emergence. Many of the factors associated with disease

emergence are present in the region, such as changes in land use and deforesta-

tion, increasing population movement, urbanization, and increasing trade. Fur-

thermore, because of their ecology and dependence on climate, there is a

strong likelihood that global warming may significantly increase the potential

for disease emergence and/or spread.

causing disease in humans and animals, and include KFD

virus, Langat (LGT) virus, Louping Ill virus, Omsk haem-

orrhagic fever virus, Powassan virus, and TBE virus. Of

these, KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever viruses cause

haemorrhagic fever in humans, while the remaining spe-

cies are encephalitogenic. Gadget’s Gully (GGY) virus and

Royal Farm virus make up the remaining species of the

mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. The seabird tick-

borne virus group contains the species Meaban, Saumerez

Reef (SRE), Tyuleniy and Kadam viruses. However, a

recent expanded phylogenetic analysis of these viruses

identified Kadam virus as a distinct third group within

the tick-borne flaviviruses (Grard et al., 2007). Transmis-

sion of tick-borne viruses to mammalian or avian hosts

occurs through the bite of infected ticks; virus can be

transmitted by infected larvae, nymphs or adult ticks.

TBE virus infections of humans can also occur via

untreated milk of goats, sheep and cows (Kohl et al.,

1996). A major factor in virus transmission between ticks

is transfer from infected to uninfected ticks during

co-feeding (Jones et al., 1987). Virus is also maintained

by transovarial and transstadial transmission (Danielová

and Holubová, 1991; Nuttall and Labuda, 2003). Once a

tick is infected, it carries the virus for the duration of its

lifetime.

There are no major human or animal pathogens

amongst the flaviviruses with no known vector. These

viruses have been isolated from bats or rodents (Varelas-

Wesley and Calisher, 1982).

Two additional viruses are listed as tentative species in

the genus; Tamana bat virus and Cell fusing agent virus.

The latter, a virus associated with Aedes mosquitoes, has

often been used as an out-group in phylogenetic studies,

but recent data on Tamana bat virus suggest that it may be

more distant (de Lamballerie et al., 2002), and thus a more

appropriate choice as an outgroup for phylogenetic analy-

ses. In addition, a novel insect flavivirus, Culex flavivirus

(CxFV), has recently been reported from Japan which was

found to be widespread in Culex pipiens and other Culex

mosquitoes (Hoshino et al., 2007). It was able to replicate

in cultured mosquito cells but not mammalian cells.

Genetic sequencing revealed that CxFV is closely related to

Cell fusing agent virus and Kamiti River virus, the other

two members of the genus associated with mosquitoes.

Perhaps the more useful indication of relationships

between flaviviruses can be obtained from phylogenetic

studies which tend to agree with antigenic and vector/

host relationships (e.g. Kuno et al., 1998; Poidinger et al.,

1996; de Zanotto et al., 1996; Mackenzie et al., 2002a).

A phylogenetic tree of the major members of the genus is

shown in Fig. 1.

Flaviviruses have shown a significant propensity to

emerge and establish in new geographic areas. This was

first observed some 400 years ago when yellow fever virus

spread from West Africa to the New World through the

slave trade, but more recently has been seen with a num-

ber of other members of the family. Thus WN virus

jumped from the Middle East to North America in 1999

(Jia et al., 1999; Lanciotti et al., 1999); Usutu virus spread

from Africa to emerge in Austria as a disease of black-

birds (Weissenböck et al., 2002); and JE virus has spread

from south-east Asia into Australasia, first into Papua

New Guinea (Johansen et al., 2000) and then into the

Torres Strait of Northern Australia (Hanna et al., 1996).

Flaviviruses of Southern, South-Eastern, and
Eastern Asia and Australasia

There are at least 30 flaviviruses found in Southern,

south-eastern and eastern Asia and Australasia which have

been recognized and classified into 11 of the 12 recog-

nized groups; 19 of the viruses are transmitted principally

by mosquitoes, seven by ticks, and four have no known

vector (Mackenzie, 2000). These viruses and their serolog-

ical group are shown in Table 1, and the phylogenetic

relationships of the Asian and Australasian viruses com-

pared with other members of the genus are shown in

Fig. 1, with the Asian and Australasian viruses depicted

within boxes. In addition, a map showing the location of

their initial isolation or detection is shown in Fig. 2. They

include some major pathogens, such as JE, WN, MVE

and the dengue viruses, whereas some of the other mem-

bers have not been associated with disease in humans or

animals. With the exception of the dengue viruses, all of

the flaviviruses have an animal reservoir, and thus either

are, or have the potential to be, zoonotic. While the den-

gue viruses may also be epizootic in their sylvan habitats

in south-east and southern Asia, or West Africa, with

non-human primates as their vertebrate hosts leading to

occasional human infections (Rudnick, 1965; De Silva

et al., 1999; Wolfe et al., 2001), dengue is now primarily

an urban and peri-urban disease with humans as the

reservoir hosts and transmission effected most often by

Aedes sp. mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. Because

the incidence of zoonotic transmission of dengue is

probably relatively infrequent in most of the region,

the dengue viruses will not be further discussed in this

presentation.

Mosquito-borne Flaviviruses

The most important mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviruses

in South-East Asia and the Western pacific are members

of the JE serological group (Mackenzie et al., 2002a), and

especially JE, MVE, and WN (including Kunjin viruses)

viruses. The importance of the other mosquito-borne

flaviviruses found in Asia and Australasia as causes of

human or animal disease are less well defined, although

at least one, Wesselsbron virus, is a major animal and

human pathogen in Africa. Details of the viruses are sum-

marized in Table 1, with the year and region of isolation,

the major vector species and vertebrate hosts, and associa-

tion with disease shown for each virus species.

JE virus

JE virus is the major mosquito-borne encephalitic flavivi-

rus in Asia (Table 1). It is believed to be responsible for

more than 40 000 cases of encephalitis annually, with

at least 10 000 deaths, although these figures are generally

regarded as a significant underestimate, and the true dis-

ease burden might be closer to 175 000 cases annually

(Tsai, 2000). With the near eradication of poliomyelitis,

JE virus is now the leading cause of childhood viral neu-

rological infection and disability in Asia (Halstead and

Jacobson, 2003). Its geographic range extends from Japan,

Korea and Maritime Siberia in the north, through China

to the Philippines in the east, and through south-eastern

and southern Asia to Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka

(Umenai et al., 1985; Burke and Leake, 1988; Vaughn and

Hoke, 1992; Endy and Nisalak, 2002; Mackenzie et al.,

2007). In recent years, JE has spread westwards into

Pakistan in 1994 (Igarashi et al., 1994), into Kerala State

in southwestern India in 1996 (Dhanda et al., 1997), and

eastwards into the Australasian region in 1995 and 1998

(Hanna et al., 1996, 1999; Ritchie et al., 1997; Johansen

et al., 2000; Mackenzie et al., 2002b). Until the 1995 JE

virus outbreak in the Torres Strait of northern Australia,

and without good scientific reasons, the south-eastern

limit of JE virus was believed to be restricted to the north

and west of the Wallace Line, an imaginary line running

between Bali and Lombok and separating the Oriental

and Australasian zoogeographic regions, whereas MVE

virus was believed to be restricted to the south and east

of the line (Marshall, 1988; Mackenzie et al., 2002b).

Much of the spread in Asia is believed to be due to defor-

estation for increased agriculture, and changes in land use

with the large increase in rice fields and irrigated agricul-

ture. JE is a zoonotic disease; the major vertebrate hosts

for JE virus are pigs and ardeid birds, with pigs playing a

central role in virus amplification. Indeed, pigs are often

the drivers of epidemic activity, although epidemics can

sometimes occur in their absence (Soman et al., 1977).

The disease in pigs is relatively minor; transplacental

transmission of JE virus is well established, leading to foe-

tal encephalitis, abortion and stillbirth, and it also causes

hypospermia and aspermia in boars (e.g. Takashima et al.,

1988; Daniels et al., 2002). Ardeid birds are the mainte-

nance hosts of JE virus, particularly Black-crowned night

herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), Little egrets (Egretta garz-

etta), and Plumed egrets (E. intermedia), but the virus

does not cause disease in birds. Pigs can also act as main-

tenance hosts in endemic areas. JE virus also causes

encephalitis in horses, but as with humans, horses are

‘dead-end’ hosts and not involved in onward transmission

(Ellis et al., 2000). Orangutans have also been implicated

as possible vertebrate hosts in sylvatic cycles of JE trans-

mission in Borneo (Wolfe et al., 2001). A number of

mosquito species have been shown to be competent for

transmitting JE, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus,

Cx. vishnui, and Cx. annulirostris being the most impor-

tant species in various geographic locations.

Phylogenetic studies have suggested that at least four

distinct genotypes of JE virus are circulating in Asia and

northern Australasia (Fig. 3) (Chen et al., 1990, 1992; Ali

and Igarashi, 1997), and there is limited evidence of a

fifth genetic lineage isolated in Singapore (Uchil and

Satchidanandam, 2001). Only one of these genotypes

(G3) has been found in all regions encompassing the geo-

graphic range of JE virus, while G1 and G2 have been

found in eastern and south-eastern Asia and northern

Australasia. The circulation of the fourth genotype

appears to have been restricted to Indonesia (Solomon

et al., 2003).

MVE and Alfuy viruses

MVE and Alfuy viruses are Australasian members of the

JE serological complex (Mackenzie et al., 1994). MVE

virus is the cause of Australian encephalitis and is the

most important Australasian member of the complex. It

is found in mainland Australia, New Guinea, and proba-

bly in the eastern Indonesian archipelago (Mackenzie

et al., 1994; Spencer et al., 2001). It is endemic in north-

ern Australia, especially in the Kimberley region of Wes-

tern Australia and the north of the Northern Territory,

and possibly endemic in parts of northern Queensland. It

is epidemic in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,

and very occasionally it spreads into south-eastern Aus-

tralia where it causes major epidemics and from where

the virus obtained its name. The two most recent epidem-

ics in south-eastern Australia were in 1951 and 1974, but

the virus also occurred in south-eastern Australia in 1956,

and most recently, in 2008 although at the time of writ-

ing, no clinical cases have been reported. Since 1978,

about 90% of human cases have occurred in the north-

west of Australia, particularly the Kimberley and Pilbara

regions, and in the Northern Territory, possibly due

to the damming of the Ord River and the establishment

of large areas of irrigated agriculture (Mackenzie and

Broom, 1998). Indeed, the virus has been gradually

moving further south in Western Australia, and is now

within about 400 km of Perth in the south-west corner of

the State (Broom et al., 2002). The major mosquito vec-

tor of MVE virus is Cx. annulirostris, although the virus

has been isolated from a number of other mosquito

species (Russell, 1995), some of which undoubtedly are

involved in transmission cycles. The major vertebrate

hosts are believed to be ardeid birds, of which the most

important is the Nankeen night heron (N. caledonicus).

Limited sequence and antigenic analyses using mono-

clonal antibodies have suggested that at least four genetic

lineages of MVE virus occur in Australasia (Fig. 3), two

of which are found on the Australian mainland, lineages

1 and 2, and two in Papua New Guinea, lineages 3 and

4 (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988; Poidinger et al., 1996;

Johansen et al., 2007).

Alfuy virus has not been associated with human disease

(Mackenzie et al., 1994), and is generally less neuroinva-

sive in murine experiments (May et al., 2006). Alfuy virus

is also believed to utilize ardeid birds as its major reser-

voir host, and Cx. annulirostris as its major vector species.

Recent antigenic, genetic and virulence studies have

shown that it is closely related to MVE virus (Fig. 3), but

is genetically, antigenically and phenotypically distinct

(May et al., 2006). Indeed, these differences have led to

the proposal that Alfuy virus be re-classified as a distinct

virus within the JE virus group (May et al., 2006).

WN virus

WN virus is found in southern Asia, especially in India

(Banerjee, 1996; Bondre et al., 2007; Mackenzie et al.,

2007), and sporadically in South-East Asia, two examples

being from Cambodia and Sarawak (Karabatsos, 1985;

H.S. Hurlbut, unpublished data, cited by Simpson et al.,

1970). Cases of WN encephalitis and febrile disease have

been reported sporadically in India (Banerjee, 1996; Thak-

are et al., 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2007), which is a very

different pattern to the epidemic activity displayed by JE

virus. In Australasia, WN is found as Kunjin virus (Scherret

et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2002), a genetically distinct sub-

lineage of WN virus lineage 1. Kunjin virus can also cause

encephalitis, Kunjin encephalitis, but the disease is gener-

ally milder than that caused by MVE virus. It can also cause

a febrile illness, sometimes with polyarthralgia and polyar-

thritis (Hall et al., 2002). As described for MVE, the geo-

graphic range of Kunjin virus probably extends through

New Guinea to parts of the eastern Indonesian archipelago,

although this has only been indicated from serological data.

Kunjin virus has also been reported from Sarawak, Borneo

(Bowen et al., 1970), and Cambodia (J. Casals, personal

communication to Bowen et al., 1970). Thus, the separate

reports of WN virus and Kunjin virus in south-east Asia

may be due to slight differences in the serological identifi-

cation. However, sequence data have shown that a Sarawak

strain of Kunjin virus is significantly different to other WN

viruses (Scherret et al., 2001, 2002).

WN virus exists in a number of distinct genetic lin-

eages and sub-lineages (Fig. 3). The strain of WN virus

that recently emerged in New York, and the virus strains

responsible for most of the major disease outbreaks, are

members of WN lineage 1a, whereas the original isolate

of WN virus from Uganda belongs to lineage 2 (Berthet

et al., 1997; Lanciotti et al., 1999; Scherret et al., 2002).

Within lineage 1, two additional sub-lineages has been

recognized – lineage 1b which contained all the Austral-

asian Kunjin viruses, and lineage 1c which comprised

four Indian WN virus isolates (Lanciotti et al., 1999;

Scherret et al., 2001). However, in a more recent detailed

phylogenetic study, Bondre et al. (2007) have described

five genetic lineages; lineages 1a, 1b and 2 remain as

described but the Indian isolates previously comprising

lineage 1c have been placed in a new lineage, lineage 5. In

addition, two newly described flaviviruses from the Czech

Republic and the Caucasus, Rabensburg (Bakonyi et al.,

2005) and LEIV-Krns88-190 (Lvov et al., 2004) respec-

tively, have been placed into lineages 3 and 4. The Sara-

wak Kunjin virus strain, however, is significantly different

to the other Kunjin viruses, and it is suggested that this

virus should be re-classified as lineage 6. Furthermore,

the African virus, Koutango, is closely related to the WN

virus lineages, and should perhaps be considered as a sev-

enth lineage (Fig. 3).

The vertebrate hosts of WN virus are birds, and in the

old world, especially ardeid birds. In Australasia, Kunjin

virus shares vertebrate hosts and vectors with MVE virus;

thus the vertebrate hosts and vectors are ardeid birds,

especially the Nankeen night heron, and vectors, such as

Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes, respectively. However, there

appears to be ecological differences between Kunjin and

MVE, with Kunjin spreading into southern Australia

more frequently than MVE virus.

Tembusu, Sitiawan and ThCAr viruses

Tembusu virus was first described in 1957 from Kuala

Lumpur, Malaysia (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2), where it had

been isolated from Cx. triteaniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus,

Aedes linneatopennis, and Anopheles philippinensis (cited

in Karabatsos, 1985). It was subsequently isolated in Thai-

land from Cx. gelidus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui,

and Cx. sitiens (P.K. Russell, personal communication in

Karabatsos, 1985; Leake et al., 1986) and in Sarawak from

Cx. gelidus, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus

(Simpson et al., 1970; Platt et al., 1975). The reservoir

hosts of Tembusu remain unknown, but there has been

serological evidence to suggest that birds and domestic

chickens may act as reservoirs (Platt et al., 1975; Wallace

et al., 1977). Tembusu virus has not been associated with

human disease, but neutralizing antibody to the virus has

been reported in human sera from Kuala Lumpur and

Sabah indicating the occurrence of asymptomatic infec-

tions (Wallace et al., 1977; Karabatsos, 1985; Wolfe et al.,

2001) and in Lombok, Indonesia (Olson et al., 1983), and

Tembusu virus was shown to cause encephalitis in experi-

mentally infected monkeys (C.E.G. Smith, unpublished

results cited by Simpson et al., 1970).

Two other related viruses have been described, ThCAr

virus (Pandey et al., 1999) and Sitiawan virus (Kono

et al., 2000) (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2). Both viruses are

genetically related to Tembusu (Kono et al., 2000), but

serological tests demonstrated that they were distinct sub-

types of Tembusu. ThCAr virus was isolated from from

Cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes trapped in Chiang Mai,

Thailand, in 1992, but no disease associations have been

observed (Pandey et al., 1999). Sitiawan virus was first

described as a cause of encephalitis and retarded growth

in broiler chickens in Perak State, Malaysia, in 2000

(Kono et al., 2000), but there has been no evidence of

human infections.

Zika virus

Zika virus is a relatively common virus throughout most

of Africa, and has been associated with occasional human

disease consisting of fever with headache and rash (Kar-

abatsos, 1985). In Asia, serological evidence of Zika virus

infections had been reported from India, Thailand,

Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines, but the virus was not

isolated until 1966 when it was obtained from Ae. aegypti

mosquitoes in Malaysia (Marchette et al., 1969) (Table 1,

Figs 1 and 2). It was subsequently implicated as a cause

of fever in patients in Central Java (Olson et al., 1981),

and neutralizing antibodies were found in human sera

collected from Lombok (Olson et al., 1983). The complete

genome sequence of Zika virus was reported recently

(Kuno and Chang, 2007). Zika virus emerged unexpect-

edly in 2007 on the island of Yap and adjoining islands

of Ulithi, Fais, Earpik, Woleai and Ifalik in the Federated

States of Micronesia with over 150 cases (Press release

from the Yap State EpiNet team, Yap State Department

of Health Services, Colonia 96943, Yap State, FSM; Lanc-

iotti et al., 2008). How and from where the virus moved

to Yap State, remains unknown. Little is known about the

reservoir hosts of Zika virus, although non-human pri-

mates have been implicated in Africa (McCrae and Kirya,

1982). Recent studies have suggested that non-human

primates may also be reservoir hosts in Asia, especially

orangutans (Wolfe et al., 2001; Kilbourn et al., 2003).

Wesselsbron and Jugra viruses

Wesselsbron virus, an important cause of disease in

humans and livestock in Africa, causing abortion in sheep

and cattle, was isolated in Thailand (T. Yuill and

P.K. Russell, personal communication to Karabatsos,

1985) (Table 1, Fig. 2). A total of four isolates were

obtained from Aedes mediolineatus and Ae. lineatopeninis,

but these isolates appear to have been lost when stocks

held at the Armed Forces Research Institute for Medical

Science in Bangkok could not be revived. There have been

no further reports of Wesselsbron virus in Asia, but it

would have been interesting to determine whether these

isolates were genetically closer to Sepik virus, a related

virus found in Papua New Guinea. The Asian isolates of

Wesselsbron were not sequenced, and there was insuffi-

cient sequence available in Genbank from the African iso-

lates for inclusion in Fig. 1. Jugra virus (Table 1, Figs 1

and 2) was isolated in Malaysia from Aedes spp. and

Uranotaenaia spp. of mosquitoes, and from the blood of

the fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis (Karabatsos, 1985),

but little is known about this virus.

Edge Hill virus

Edge Hill virus was first isolated in Cairns in 1961

(Table 1, Figs 1 and 2) (Doherty et al., 1963). It has

subsequently been isolated from a range of mosquitoes

trapped in north Queensland, New South Wales, the

Northern Territory, and Western Australia, including Cx.

annulirostris, Ae. vigilax, Ae. normanensis, Ae. bancrofti-

anus, An. amictus, and Coquillettidia linealis (reviewed in

Mackenzie et al., 1994; Russell, 1995; Macdonald et al.,

2001). The major vertebrate hosts are believed to be

marsupials (Doherty et al., 1964; Hawkes et al., 1985). A

sero-epidemiological study in New South Wales has sug-

gested that occasional human infections occur (Hawkes

et al., 1985), and there has been one unconfirmed report

implicating Edge Hill virus as the possible aetiological

agent in a patient presenting with arthralgia, myalgia, and

fatigue (Aaskov et al., 1993). Antigenic and genetic analy-

ses have shown that distinct subtypes of Edge Hill virus

exist in Western Australia and the Northern Territory

(Macdonald et al., 2001).

Sepik virus

Sepik virus has only been isolated from Papua New Guinea

(Table 1, Figs 1 and 2), although serological studies have

suggested it might also occur elsewhere in the Indonesian

archipelago. It was first isolated from Mansonia septem-

punctata, Ficalbia flavens, Ficalbia spp., and Armigeres spp.

trapped in the Sepik district of Papua New Guinea (Wood-

roofe and Marshall, 1971; Karabatsos, 1985), and more

recently, from Cx. sitiens subgroup mosquitoes trapped in

Western Province of Papua New Guinea (Johansen et al.,

2000; Nisbet et al., 2001). High neutralizing antibody titres

in the convalescent serum of a New Guinea patient hospi-

talized with a febrile disease makes it a suspected human

pathogen (Woodroofe and Marshall, 1971). In addition,

from its close antigenic relationship to Wesselsbron virus

and from seroepidemiological studies on Lombok (Olson

et al., 1983), there is a suggestion that it might infect live-

stock. Sepik virus is the closest virus phylogenetically to

yellow fever virus (Kuno and Chang, 2006), and is therefore

particularly interesting on evolutionary grounds.

Kokobera, Stratford and New Mapoon viruses

Kokobera and Stratford viruses are the only two members

of the Kokobera serological group of Flaviviruses (Thiel

et al., 2005), and New Mapoon virus is a recently isolated

member of the group (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2) (Nisbet

et al., 2005). Both viruses had originally been classified as

members of the JE serological group, but antigenic (Hall

et al., 1991) and genomic sequence analysis (Poidinger

et al., 1996) suggested that they should be reclassified into

their own group. Further genomic studies demonstrated

that Kokobera virus exists in several different genetic

subtypes in different parts of Australia and Papua New

Guinea (Poidinger et al., 2000). Kokobera virus is enzo-

otic to Australia and Papua New Guinea. The virus was

first isolated from Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes trapped

at Kowanyama (Mitchell River Mission) in northern

Queensland in 1960 (Doherty et al.,1963). Since that

time, the virus has been isolated from various species of

mosquitoes in Western Australia, Northern Territory,

Queensland, New South Wales and Papua New Guinea

(Mackenzie et al., 1994; Russell, 1995). Most recently, it

has spread into the south-west of Western Australia (Poi-

dinger et al., 2000). Serological evidence suggests that

kangaroos and other macropods are the major wildlife

reservoirs, although horses may also act as reservoir hosts

(Doherty et al., 1964, 1971). Seroepidemiological studies

in New South Wales, Queensland and Papua New Guinea

have indicated that occasional human infections occur

with Kokobera virus, and indeed, it was subsequently

shown to be the cause of rare cases of acute polyarticular

disease in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales

(Doherty et al., 1964; Hawkes et al., 1985, 1993; Bough-

ton et al., 1986).

Stratford virus is enzootic in Australia and possibly in

Papua New Guinea. It was first isolated from Ae. vigilax

mosquitoes trapped in Cairns in north Queensland in

1961 (Doherty et al., 1963). Stratford virus has been iso-

lated from several mosquito species, including Ae. vigilax

in Queensland and New South Wales, and Cx. annuliros-

tris, Ae. procax and Ae. notoscriptus in New South Wales.

However, the role of each of these in transmission is

unknown. Seroepidemiological studies carried out in New

South Wales suggested that occasional human infections

had occurred (Hawkes et al., 1985), but there has been

no reported association with human disease.

Two other related viruses have been reported from

Cape York, northern Australia. After monoclonal anti-

body analysis and sequencing studies, one of these viruses

was deemed to be a distant subtype of Kokobera virus,

but the other was shown to be a distinct yet related virus,

and the name New Mapoon virus has been suggested

(Nisbet et al., 2005).

Tick-borne Flaviviruses

Six tick-borne flaviviruses have been described from

southern, south-eastern, and eastern Asia, and from

Australasia (Table 2, Figs 1 and 2).

Two of the viruses were reported from Australasia,

GGY virus and SRE virus. GGY virus was isolated from

Ixodes (Ceratixodes) uriae ticks collected from 1975 to

1979 on Macquarie Island, in the southern Pacific Ocean,

south of Tasmania (St George et al., 1985). Ticks were

collected from areas inhabited by Royal penguins (Eudy-

ptes chrysolophus schlegeli), however, disease association

with seabirds has not been established and a limited

serological survey of flavivirus antibodies in birds trapped

on Macquarie Island was inconclusive (St George et al.,

1985). Although GGY virus belongs to the mammalian

tick-borne flavivirus group, it is associated with seabird

transmission cycles. Further, GGY virus does not display

the clinal geographic distribution reported for other

mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses. It has therefore been

suggested that it may constitute an evolutionary link

between seabird-associated viruses and the more recently

emerged mammalian-associated viruses (Grard et al.,

2007). SRE virus was isolated in 1974 from soft ticks

(Ornithodoros capensis) collected from the nests of

seabirds, Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata), on Saumarez Reef

and Frederick Reef off the east coast of Queensland, and

from hard ticks (I. eudpyptidis) collected from Silver Gulls

(Larus novaehollandiae) in Tasmania (St George et al.,

1977). This investigation was initiated following reports

of febrile illness in meteorological workers operating on

Saumerez Reef, who had been bitten by ticks. However,

infection with SRE virus was not confirmed in these cases

and association of SRE virus with human disease has not

since been reported. A large sero-epidemiological survey

of �17 000 human sera collected from New South Wales
also failed to find any evidence of human infection with

either SRE virus, or GGY virus (Hawkes et al., 1985).

Similarly, in a subsequent sero-survey of human and

avian residents of the Coral Sea and the Great Barrier

Reef, off the east coast of Queensland, no evidence for

human infections with SRE virus was found, despite the

presence of neutralizing (NT) antibodies in seabirds

(Humphery-Smith et al., 1991). Interestingly, this study

also revealed the presence of NT antibodies to GGY virus

in equal proportions (4%) in the human and avian popu-

lations tested. The potential pathogenicity of SRE virus

for seabirds was indicated by small scale experimental

infections of little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor),

which led to disease and mortality 9–13 days post-inocu-

lation (Morgan et al., 1985). Further experimental and

field investigations of SRE virus and GGY virus will be

required to fully delineate the pathogenic potential of

these viruses in avian and human populations.

Four tick-borne flaviviruses have been described from

eastern, south-eastern and southern Asia. LGT virus was

first isolated in Malaysia from I. granulatus hard ticks

collected from two species of forest rats (Rattus mulleri

and R. sabanus) (Smith, 1956). Subsequently, LGT virus

was isolated in Thailand from Haemaphysalis papuana

soft ticks associated with several species of forest rats

(R. rattus, R. fulvescens, R. niviventor, R. surifer), implying

that this virus may be widely distributed in forests

throughout South-East Asia (Bancroft et al., 1976). No

apparent human disease association has been found for

endemic south-east Asian strains of LGT virus – a prop-

erty that has led to the evaluation of the Malaysian TP21

strain as a vaccine candidate for TBE virus (Gritsun et al.,

2003). However, in Russia during the 1970s, a small

number of human cases of meningoencephalitis were

observed in recipients of a live-attenuated LGT-based vac-

cine for TBE (reviewed in Gritsun et al., 2003). In Japan,

Negishi virus – a mammalian tick-borne flavivirus – was

first isolated in Tokyo from an encephalitis patient in

1948 (Ando et al., 1952). There was a second fatal case

from Tokyo shortly after and human cases have been rec-

ognized in China. More recently, genetic characterization

of Negishi virus indicated it is a strain of Louping ill

virus (Venugopal et al., 1992). No further cases of Negishi

virus infection have been reported and no endemic foci

or tick vectors have been identified, and there has been

speculation about its possible origin. The first human case

of TBE caused by a subtype, Russian Spring Summer

encephalitis virus, was reported in 1993 on the northern

Japanese island of Hokkaido (Takashima et al., 1997),

located in close proximity to Maritime Siberia where TBE

virus is known to be prevalent. Further investigations on

Hokkaido led to virus isolations from sentinel dogs, from

I. granulatus ticks, and from small mammals (Apodemus

speciosus and Clethrionomys rufocanus) (Takashima et al.,

1997; Takeda et al., 1998, 1999), demonstrating endemic

foci throughout the island. The Japanese strains of TBE

virus are divided into three groups within the Far-eastern

subtype and recent phylogenetic evidence indicated that

transmission of the virus between Russia and Japan has

occurred at least three times in the past 700 years – prob-

ably via the East Asian-Australian flyway of migratory

birds (Suzuki, 2007). KFD virus is the major tick-borne

virus from southern Asia. It emerged in 1957 in Karna-

taka State of southern India, and continues to be

restricted to that State (Rodrigues, 1988; Pattnaik, 2006),

although there is some suggestive evidence that silent

transmission may also occur elsewhere in India and the

Andaman and Nicobar islands (Pattnaik, 2006). It causes

a prostrating human febrile disease with haemorrhagic

and encephalitic manifestations and a case fatality rate of

between 5% and 10% (Rodrigues, 1988; Pattnaik, 2006).

Interestingly, a novel but closely related virus emerged in

1992 in Saudi Arabia, Alkhurma virus; over 60 human

cases of Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever disease have been

reported, mainly from Mecca and Jeddah, with several

deaths (Zaki, 1997; Charrel et al., 2001; Pattnaik, 2006),

demonstrating once again that novel pathogenic flavivi-

ruses may emerge at any time.

Flaviviruses With no Known Vector

There are at least four flaviviruses reported from Eastern

and South-Eastern Asia with no known vector (Thiel

et al., 2005; Table 3, Figs 1 and 2). These include Apoi

and Yokose viruses from Japan, Carey Island virus from

Malaysia, Phnom Penh bat virus from Malaysia and Cam-

bodia (Salaun et al., 1974; Karabatsos, 1985). An addi-

tional virus, Batu Cave virus, is believed to be a subtype

of Phnom Penh virus.

Apoi virus was first isolated from rodents in 1954 in

Japan. Isolates have been reported from Apodemus specio-

sus and Ap. argentosus hokkaidi, and from Clethrionomys

species. Apoi virus has been classified as a member of the

Modoc virus group, and has only been found on the

island of Hokkaido, Japan. Antibodies to Apoi virus have

been found in humans and horses in Hokkaido, and the

virus has been associated with human disease causing

CNS symptoms and leg paralysis. The other three viruses

have all been isolated from bats, and none have been

associated with disease in either bats or humans (Karabat-

sos, 1985). Carey Island virus has been isolated from two

species of fruit bat, Macroglossus lagochilus and Cynopterus

brachyotis, in Peninsula Malaysia; Phnom Penh bat virus

was first isolated from the salivary glands and brown fat

of the Cy. brachiotus angulatus bats collected at the

Chrui-Chang-War peninsula, Phnom Penh, Cambodia in

June 1969, and from Cy. brachyotis and Eonycteris spelaea

bats in Malaysia; and Yokose virus was isolated from an

insectivorous bat, Miniopterus fuliginosus (Japanese long-

fingered bat), caught on Kyushu Island, Japan, in 1971

(Karabatsos, 1985; Tajima et al., 2005). Carey Island and

Phnom Penh bat viruses are species in the Rio Bravo

virus group (Thiel et al., 2005), whereas Yokose virus is a

member of the Entebbe bat virus group (Karabatsos,

1985; Kuno et al., 1998; Tajima et al., 2005). Interestingly,

the Entebbe bat virus group members are not closely

related phylogenetically to the other flaviviruses with no

known vector, but are closely related to yellow fever virus

and other related mosquito-borne viruses (Fig. 1). They

can replicate in mosquito and mammalian cells (Kuno

and Chang, 2006), so whether they can also be vectored

by mosquitoes must remain a possibility.

Evolution and Phylogeny of Flaviviruses

The increasing availability of partial and full-length geno-

mic sequence information for members of the Flavivirus

genus have enabled the resolution of the phylogenetic

relationships of these viruses. This work underlies current

hypotheses on their origins, evolution and dispersal.

Phylogenetic reconstructions have identified three distinct

clades belonging to the mosquito-, tick-borne, and no

known vector viruses (Zanotto et al., 1996; Kuno et al.,

1998; Billoir et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001; Fig. 1).

Depending on the region of the genome analysed, the

evolution of these groups can be explained by two

conflicting theories: (i) the no known vector group

diverged from an ancestor virus before the vector-borne

viruses (NS5 gene), and (ii) the no known vector and

tick-borne viruses evolved as a sister group from a com-

mon ancestor, with the mosquito-borne viruses arising

independently (NS3 gene, complete open reading frame).

The latter hypothesis has gained recent support from a

comprehensive phylogenetic study by Cook and Holmes

(2006), demonstrating that the NS3-based phylogeny pro-

vided statistically significant evidence of mosquito-borne

viruses evolving as an outgroup to the remaining flavi-

viruses. In contrast, the NS5 data set did not contain suf-

ficient phylogenetic signal to support either theory.

Regardless, it is accepted that the acquisition of tick-

borne transmission is a derived trait since all phylogenetic

analyses show the tick-borne group to diverge from one

of the other two flavivirus groups (Kuno et al., 1998;

Billoir et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001; Cook and Holmes,

2006).

Within the mosquito-borne group, viruses are

sub-divided into Aedes and Culex clades, reflecting the

predominant vector of the viruses in each group (Billoir

et al., 2000; Gaunt et al., 2001). These groupings correlate

with vertebrate host and disease syndrome. Thus, the

Culex clade contains neurotropic viruses, such as JE and

WN, associated with bird reservoir hosts, while viruses

belonging to the Aedes clade, such yellow fever and den-

gue, associate with haemorrhagic disease and primate

hosts (Gaunt et al., 2001). Two main clades have been

identified for the tick-borne viruses, one associated with

sea-birds and one associated with rodent hosts, the latter

containing the TBE viruses. The no known vector viruses

form three groups, of which one is associated with bats

and two with rodent hosts (Kuno et al., 1998; Gaunt

et al., 2001). Interestingly, the Entebbe Bat group of no

known vector viruses clusters within the mosquito-borne

group (Kuno et al., 1998) and is thought to indicate sec-

ondary loss of vector-borne transmission (Cook and

Holmes, 2006), but may also reflect the failure to isolate

mosquito vectors of these viruses.

There is compelling evidence to suggest that the flavivi-

ruses have their origins in the Old World (Gaunt et al.,

2001; Gould et al., 2003). Thus, the earliest lineage of the

mosquito-borne group is the Aedes-associated virus clade,

from which the Culex-borne clade is descendent. Viruses

from the Aedes group are thought to have African

ancestry since the majority are found on this continent.

Only yellow fever and the dengue viruses of the Aedes

clade are found in the New World; their emergence there

has been proposed to have occurred during the slave

trade from the Old World to the Americas (Gaunt et al.,

2001; Gould et al., 2003). Phylogenetic trees of the mos-

quito-borne viruses reveal a two-phase pattern in which a

slow branching process is followed by rapid growth, with

poor geographic structure and frequent lineage extinction

(Zanotto et al., 1996). This was explained by the existence

of mosquito-borne flaviviruses in low-prevalence endemic

cycles up until recently (�200 years ago) when the avail-
ability of new and susceptible hosts, coupled with increas-

ing worldwide movement and mixing of vectors, viruses

and hosts led to a massive virus population expansion

(Zanotto et al., 1996). Thus, in South-East Asia, some of

the viruses of the JE group have been hypothesized to

arise in the Indo-Malaysian region from an ancestral virus

of African origin (Solomon et al., 2003; Gould et al.,

2004). From this region, and aided by human activities

promoting vector-bird transmission such as rice cultiva-

tion, dispersal and subsequent speciation has led to their

current biogeography. Evidence of African ancestry of the

JE group is observed by the close phylogenetic relation-

ship of JE, MVE and Alfuy viruses of South East Asia and

Australasia with the African virus Usutu (Fig. 3). Unlike

other members of the JE group, WN virus is thought to

have first emerged from Africa before spreading north-

ward and eastward via migratory birds (Gould et al.,

2003). How the South-East Asian types of West Nile

became established is not fully understood, however, it

has been hypothesised that Malaysian and Australian sub-

types evolved from a common ancestor (Scherret et al.,

2001). It is conceivable that this may have taken place in

the Indo-Malaysian region, as proposed for JE virus

(Solomon et al., 2003). It is notable that the African virus

Koutango clusters within the WN virus group in phylo-

genetic reconstructions, indicating that this virus is a line-

age of WN virus (Fig. 3). This may reflect the origin of

the WN virus species; however, further sequence informa-

tion for Koutango will be required to better establish the

phylogenetic relationships of this virus.

Of the tick-borne flaviviruses, virtually all are found

in the Old World. Phylogenetic analyses have provided

evidence that the mammalian tick-borne viruses have

evolved gradually along a geographical cline over the past

2000 years after an initial dispersal event from Africa

(Zanotto et al., 1995, 1996; Gould et al., 2004). These

viruses dispersed north and westwards across the forests

of Asia and Europe from an ancestral lineage in the east-

ern part of its geographic range, with the more recent

species occurring in the north-western end of its range.

This contrasts with the pattern of evolution and dispersal

of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses and is thought to

reflect the lifecycle of ticks (Zanotto et al., 1996). For

example, the tick generation time can be measured in

months to years and direct virus transmission can occur

between vectors during co-feeding on non-viraemic hosts,

enabling viral lineages to survive for relatively long peri-

ods. While phylogenetic evidence indicates that the Far-

eastern subtype of TBE virus found in Japan originated

from Russia (Suzuki, 2007), the origins of other mamma-

lian tick-borne flaviviruses listed in Table 2 are not clear.

The seabird tick-borne viruses are associated with seabird

ticks and have mainly been isolated in the Old World. In

contrast with the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses,

there is no evidence of a close relationship between

genetic evolution and geographic distribution (Grard

et al., 2007). It is therefore assumed that seabird tick-

borne flaviviruses have been disseminated by independent

migratory flights and that their observed genetic evolution

reflects adaptation to the different ecological niches they

have reached (Grard et al., 2007). The emergence of

the Australian seabird-associated viruses GGY and SRE

may have thus occurred via migratory seabirds from the

northern hemisphere. Indeed, St George et al. (1985) sug-

gested that GGY virus represents a genetic link between

subarctic and subantarctic tick-borne viruses based on the

identification of the seabird species Oceanites oceanicus

and Sterna paradisaea, which breed in the Arctic and

migrate to the Antarctic and vice versa (respectively).

The no known vector viruses are found in either the

Old World or the New World, implying that they were

dispersed widely following their emergence (Gaunt et al.,

2001; Gould et al., 2003). While bat-associated no

known vector viruses are found in the Old World and

New World, the rodent-associated no known vector

viruses are found mainly in the New World, with the

notable exception of Apoi virus, which is found in

Japan. The latter distribution is consistent with a single

dispersal event (such as bat migration) from the Old

World followed by local infection of rodents and subse-

quently restricted distribution (Gaunt et al., 2001). Thus,

the no vector viruses of South-East Asia (Table 3) are

likely to have emerged from migratory bats and estab-

lished localized transmission cycles in bat colonies or

rodent populations.

Emergence and Spread of Flaviviruses

Flaviviruses have a strong predeliction to spread and

establish in new areas, as recently described for WN virus

The Zoonotic Flaviviruses J. S. Mackenzie and D. T. Williams

in the Americas (reviewed by Gubler, 2007), for JE virus

in Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait of northern

Australia (reviwed by Mackenzie et al., 2007), and for

Usutu virus in Austria (Weissenböck et al., 2002), and

subsequently elsewhere in Europe, including Spain (Bus-

quets et al., 2008), Hungary (Bakonyi et al., 2007), and

Italy (Rizzoli et al., 2007). This latter spread is particularly

interesting as Usutu virus is one the closest viruses phylo-

genetically to MVE virus. Thus known flaviviruses may

emerge in a new locality unexpectedly and sometimes

over long distances, probably due largely to the migratory

habits of avian vertebrate hosts.

However, over the past decade, a number of new, pre-

viously unrecognized flaviviruses have also been reported,

including Rabensburg virus in the Czech Republic (Bak-

onyi et al., 2005), Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia (Zaki,

1997; Charrel et al., 2001; Pattnaik, 2006), Sitiawan virus

in Malaysia (Kono et al., 2000), ThCAr virus in Thailand

(Pandey et al., 1999), LEIV-Krns88-190 in the Caucasus

region (Lvov et al., 2004; and New Mapoon virus in Aus-

tralia (Nisbet et al., 2005). It is difficult to assign a spe-

cific reason for the emergence of these novel viruses, and

in most cases their detection has been due either to a

newly recognized disease entity, as described for Akhurma

and Sitiawan viruses, or serendipity through the field col-

lection of arthropods for studies of other and often

related viruses. As an example, Rabensburg virus was iso-

lated from mosquitoes trapped during a flood in 1997

near the Czech-Austrian border, and although cases of

febrile illness due to WN virus had been reported previ-

ously from the Czech Republic, there had been no disease

outbreak at the time of collection (Bakonyi et al., 2005).

New hosts may also lead to new genetic variants, as seen

with LEIV-Krns88-190 which was isolated from ticks

rather than the more usual mosquito vectors. With the

ease with which these viruses have been detected, it is

probable that many other flaviviruses exist and remain to

be discovered. A number of factors may contribute to the

risk or potential of emergence, including changes in land

use, especially if involving new ecological niches, increas-

ing travel and trade, increasing urbanization and popula-

tion density, and changes to climate and weather through

global warming. Many of these factors have been impor-

tant in national developments in the Asia-Pacific regions,

especially the changes in land use, including deforestation,

to provide increased agricultural land for rice growing,

and increased urbanization and population density giving

rise to mega-cities. The strong inter-dependence of mos-

quito-borne virus ecology with climatic factors would

suggest that the global warming and climatic changes may

have a significant affect on the potential for new virus

emergence and for the increased spread and incidence of

many known viruses. Rabensburg virus may be viewed as

an example of this as it was first described following

severe flooding. Thus, new previously unrecognized

flaviviruses may arise anywhere and at anytime, and there

is little doubt that with these viruses we should expect

the unexpected.

Conclusions

As shown in this brief review, the genus Flaviviridae con-

sists of a number of viruses, some of which are associated

with severe human disease including encephalitis and

haemorrhagic fever, some with mild, febrile disease, but

most have no known association with disease in either

humans or animals. The members of the genus have a

well recognized propensity to spread and establish in new

areas, and although their characteristics are well defined,

they are still unpredictable and may exhibit increases in

disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, unex-

pected methods of transmission, and long-term persis-

tence (Gould and Solomon, 2006). Furthermore, and as

exemplified by New Mapoon in Australasia, by Sitiawan

virus in southern Asia, by Alkhurma virus in Saudi

Arabia, and by Rabensburg in the Czech Republic, new

flaviviruses continue to be found. Thus as a genus, they

are well suited to be the source of new, zoonotic

emergent diseases.

ABSTRACT: We screened for antibodies to 16 arboviruses in four populations of free-ranging sloths in
Costa Rica. Blood samples were taken from 16 Hoffman’s two-toed sloths (HTSs; Choloepus hoffmanni)
and 26 brown-throated sloths (BTSs; Bradypus variegatus) over a 3-yr period. We used serologic assays
to detect antibodies against 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths (St. Louis encephalitis
[SLEV], Changuinola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Ilheus [ILHV], Oropouche, Mayaro, Utinga,
Murutucu, Punta Toro, and vesicular stomatitis [VSV] viruses) and six arboviruses not described in
sloths (Rio Grande, West Nile [WNV], eastern equine encephalitis, Piry, Munguba, and La Crosse
viruses). Overall, 80% of sloths had detectable antibodies to SLEV, 67% had antibodies to ILHV, 32%
to Punta Toro virus, 30% to Changuinola virus, 15% to WNV, 14% to VSV, 11% to Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus, and 10% to Rio Grande virus. No samples had detectable antibodies to the remaining
eight viruses. We found a significant increase in prevalence of antibody to VSV in HTSs between 2005
and 2007, and for WNV antibody between 2005 and 2006. We found no significant differences in the
prevalences of antibodies to the sampled viruses between the two locations. Antibody prevalences were
significantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs for SLEV in 2005. Antibody-positive results for ILHV were
likely due to cross-reaction with SLEV. The novel finding of antibodies to Rio Grande virus in sloths
could be due to cross-reaction with another phlebovirus. These findings might have implications for
land management and domestic animal health. Due to the nature of the study, we could not determine
whether sloths could represent amplification hosts for these viruses, or whether they were only exposed
and could be used as sentinel species. Further studies are needed to fully characterize arboviral
exposure in sloths.

INTRODUCTION

Choloepus hoffmanni and Bradypus varie-
gatus, commonly known as the Hoffman’s
two-toed sloth (HTS) and the brown-throated
sloth (BTS), respectively, are hosts for many
tropical arboviruses with potential public
health implications (Seymour et al. 1983a, b,
c; Gilmore et al. 2001). Additionally, sloths are
hosts to some viruses often shared between
livestock and other domesticated species
(Seymour et al. 1983c; Figueiredo 2007).
The low metabolism of sloths could be
associated with a long-lasting viremia for
many viruses, which might increase transmis-
sion stability (Seymour et al. 1983a).

We screened for antibody to selected
arboviruses in populations of BTSs and HTSs
inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica. The
viruses included 10 arboviruses previously
described in sloths: St. Louis encephalitis
(SLEV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis
(VEEV), Changuinola (CGLV), Ilheus (ILHV),
Oropouche (OROV), Mayaro (MAYV), Utinga
(UTIV), Murutucu (MURV), Punta Toro
(PTV), and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) viruses
(Tesh et al. 1969; Seymour et al. 1983a, b, c;
Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al. 2001) and six
arboviruses not reported in sloths: Rio Grande
(RGV), West Nile (WNV), eastern equine
encephalitis (EEEV), Piry (PIRYV), Munguba
(MUNV), and La Crosse (LCV) viruses.

Flaviviruses

Among flaviviruses, we investigated expo-
sure to WNV, ILHV, and SLEV, all vectored
by mosquitoes (Pauvolid-Correa et al. 2013;
Rivarola et al. 2014). Saint Louis encephalitis
virus infects a variety of vertebrate hosts,
among which sloths, primates, birds, marsu-
pials, and armadillos are considered reservoirs
(Seymour et al. 1983a; Figueiredo 2007).
Free-ranging BTSs in Panama maintain a
high SLEV antibody prevalence of 39%
(Seymour et al. 1983b). Experimental infec-
tion with SLEV in sloths produced a high-titer
and long-lasting antibody response compared
to other hosts (Seymour et al. 1983a). Sloths
are relatively poor amplification hosts after
mosquito inoculation compared to chicks

(Gallus gallus domesticus) or mice (Mus
musculus; Seymour et al. 1983a). Despite
low transmission, because sloths are relatively
common in Central American forests (Eisen-
berg and Thorington 1973; Montgomery and
Sunquist 1978), they are considered important
hosts in the transmission of SLEV.

Alphaviruses

Some alphaviruses are emerging pathogens,
including chikungunya virus, VEEV, MAYV,
and EEEV (Figueiredo 2007; Cassadou et al.
2014; Fischer and Staples 2014; Horcada et al.
2015). Three of these (VEEV, EEEV, and
MAYV) are zoonotic and widespread in South
America (Hubalek et al. 2014). Mayaro virus
causes epidemics of febrile exanthematous
illness in humans in Latin America, often
accompanied by arthralgia (Woodall 1967; de
Thoisy et al. 2003). It is a major arboviral
infection transmitted by mosquitoes and
relevant to public health in rural South
America (de Thoisy et al. 2003; Figueiredo
2007; Figueiredo and Figueiredo 2014).
Sloths with MAYV antibody have been
reported in French Guyana (de Thoisy et al.
2003) but not in Panama (Seymour et al.
1983b).

Orthobunyaviruses

La Crosse virus is one of the four primary
causes of zoonotic encephalitis in the US (Go
et al. 2014). Humans are considered dead-end
hosts (Smith et al. 2006; Go et al. 2014) but,
when symptomatic, frequently present with
influenza-like clinical signs and encephalitis
(Go et al. 2014). No disease is documented in
animals. Prevalence of LCV antibodies has not
been studied in sloths. Rio Grande virus is a
member of the phlebotomus fever group. The
primary vector is the hematophagous sand fly
Lutzomyia anthophora (Endris et al. 1983).
This virus has not been investigated in sloths.

Oropouche virus is a zoonotic Orthobunya-
virus causing acute Oropouche fever (Figueir-
edo 2007). The sylvatic cycle includes sloths as
reservoirs and mosquitoes as vectors (Pinheiro
et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007). The urban cycle
involves humans with Culex quinquefasciatus

and Culicoides paraensis midges as vectors
(Pinheiro et al. 1981; Figueiredo 2007).
Oropouche virus was described in Brazil in
1960, when it was isolated from a pale-
throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridacty-
lus) captured near a forested area during
construction of the Belem-Brasilia highway
(Woodall 1967).

Utinga virus has been documented in pale-
throated three-toed sloth in Utinga forest,
Belem, Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967). Punta
Toro virus is a rare zoonotic virus causing
febrile illness in humans and vectored by sand
flies Lutzomyia spp. (Seymour et al. 1983c). It
was studied as a model for Rift Valley fever
infection in laboratory animals (Ashley et al.
2011) and has been used as a vaccine
candidate against Rift Valley fever (Lihorado-
va et al. 2013). Murutucu virus was isolated
from a BTS in Para, Brazil (Woodall 1967).

Phleboviruses

Rio Grande virus is a member of the
phlebotomus fever group and has not been
investigated in sloths. The primary vector is
the hematophagous sand fly, Lutzomyia an-
thophora (Endris et al. 1983). A Munguba
virus antibody-positive HTS was found in
Monte Dourado, Jari, Para, Brazil (Woodall
1967).

Orbiviruses

Changuinola virus is a rare zoonotic orbivi-
rus with only one reported case of febrile
human disease (Woodall 1967). The primary
vector in Brazil and Panama is the sandfly,
Lutzomyia umbratilis (Woodall 1967). Anti-
body-positive sloths have been reported in
Panama (Seymour et al. 1983a, b) and Brazil
(Gilmore et al. 2001) and are believed to be
reservoirs for this virus (Seymour et al.
1983c).

Vesiculoviruses

Vesicular stomatitis is a reportable disease
to the Office International des Epizooties.
Sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.) and black flies
(Simulium spp.) are vectors (Comer et al.
1990; Cupp et al. 1992; Mead 2006). Virginia

opossums (Didelphis virginiana) are suspect-
ed to be a maintenance host for VSV (Trujillo
et al. 2010), and deer mice (Peromyscus
maniculatus) may represent an amplifying
host (Mead 2006). Although VSV may cause
a flu-like disease in humans (Mead 2006), the
primary concern is to livestock in the agrarian
regions of Costa Rica (Atwill et al. 1993).
Panamanian sloths have been found to be
antibody positive for VSV Indiana serotype by
plaque reduction neutralization test, with 32%
of Choloepus spp. and 15% of Bradypus spp.
antibody positive (Tesh et al. 1969).

Antibodies against Piry virus have been
identified in a wide variety of mammals (Wilks
and House 1984) including Xenarthra in
Brazil with 8.8% antibody prevalence (CDC
2014).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We collected blood samples from two sloth
species inhabiting two locations in Costa Rica
between July and August in 2005–07. We chose
two locations corresponding with ongoing wildlife
research projects tracking the movement of free-
ranging sloths. The primary location used for
capture was Finmac, a 107-ha organic cacao
plantation in northeastern Costa Rica (10820 00N,
83820 00W), surrounded by banana and pineapple
plantations and pastures. The second location,
used for collection in 2007 only, was a cacao
plantation outside of the community of Upala
(108540N, 85820W), surrounded by pasture, sparse
forest, and pineapple plantations. Participants
included wildlife biologists, veterinarians, and
veterinary students from the Universidad Nacio-
nal (Heredia, Costa Rica) and the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora permits and local permis-
sions were obtained for sample collection. All
procedures in this study were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Wisconsin.

Sloths were captured manually, placed in
burlap sacks, and transported to a consistent
location before being anesthetized as described by
Hanley et al. (2008). Time between capture and
release did not exceed 12 h. Capture location was
documented for each sloth by GPS to ensure
return to the original capture site. After transpor-
tation, each sloth was immobilized with medeto-
midine 0.02 mg/kg (1 mg/mL; Domitort, Pfizer
Animal Health, Exton, Pennsylvania, USA) and

ketamine hydrochloride 2.5 mg/kg (100 mg/mL;
Ketavett, Revetmex, Colonia Prado Churubsco,
Deleg, Coyoacan, Mexico). Anesthetic monitoring
was performed by one of the investigators
(C.S.H.) and included respiratory rate and heart
rate via Doppler flow probe and stethoscope. A
full physical exam was completed. Blood samples
were collected from the cephalic, saphenous, or
femoral veins, or the cranial vena cava, and
preserved in 2.0 mL heparinized tubes. Blood
samples were centrifuged within 60 min of
collection, and serum was placed in 1.8 mL
plastic microtainers (Nalgene screw-top, Lima,
Ohio, USA), and kept in an ice chest until frozen
at �4 C. Each sloth had a passive integrated
transponder (ID 100US, Trovan Ltd., Santa
Barbara, California, USA) implanted subcutane-
ously in the interscapular region to prevent
resampling during the same year.

Prior to recovery, each sloth received 20–100
mL of lactated Ringer’s solution (Hospira, Lake
Forest, Illinois, USA) subcutaneously. Atipame-
zole 0.1 mg/kg was administered intramuscularly
to antagonize medetomidine. After complete
recovery, sloths were released at their capture
site. Frozen sera were transported to the Univer-
sity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas,
US, for testing.

Serologic testing

Hemaglutination inhibition (HI) test: Sera were
tested for antibodies to EEEV, ILHV, MAYV,
MUNV, MURV, OROV, RGV, SLEV, UTIV, and
VEEV. The HI tests were performed in microtiter
plates as described by Shope (1963). Nonspecific
inhibitors of sera were acetone extracted by a
classical technique (Clarke and Casals 1958). To
remove goose cell agglutinins, rehydrated sera
(pH 9.0 borate saline) were adsorbed with goose
cells. Tests were performed with 4 units of
antigen, obtained by sucrose acetone extraction
and inactivated by treatment with betapropiolac-
tone, against 1:10 serum dilution used for
screening.

Complement fixation (CF) test: Sera were
screened for antibodies to six arbovirus antigens:
ILHV, SLEV, LCV, PTV, CGLV, and PIRYV.
Testing by CF was performed using a micro-
technique following Beaty et al. (1989). The
highest dilutions giving 3þ or 4þ fixation of
complement (scale of 0–4) were recorded as
positive, and a positive result for the 1:10 dilution
was considered antibody positive.

Plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT):
All sera SLEV- and VEEV-positive by HI were
tested by PRNT to confirm specificity using
strains T35573 and 68U201, respectively. In
addition, sera were tested for WNV and VSV
using strains NY99 and Mudd-Summers, respec-

tively. Serum samples were serially diluted and
incubated with 100 plaque-forming units of virus
before inoculation onto confluent Vero cells as
described by Seymour et al. (1983c).

Serologic test variability depending on the year:
Due to test availability and financial limitations,
some tests were conducted only in some years.
We investigated the presence of antibodies to
SLEV, VEEV, ILHV, OROV, MAYV, MURV, and
WNV every year. In 2007 the VEEV HI test was
refined to detect specific antibodies against the
subtype I variant AB, typically responsible for
epizootic outbreaks, and subtype II. In 2007
PRNT was performed to detect neutralizing
antibodies against VEEV subtype I variant E.
The VSV PRNT was conducted in 2005 and 2007.
Serologic testing for CGLV, UTIV, PIRYV, and
LCV was conducted in 2005 and 2006 but not in
2007. Serologic testing for PTV and MUNV was
performed only in 2005, and RGV and EEEV
were tested only in 2007.

Statistical analysis

Yearly antibody prevalence for each virus was
calculated by dividing the total number of
antibody-positive animals by the total number of
sloths sampled, including sloths resampled each
year. Statistical tests were conducted using
GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Califor-
nia, USA). Differences between sampling loca-
tions were evaluated with Fisher’s exact test. For
arboviruses evaluated during multiple years,
differences between years were also evaluated
using Fisher’s exact test. For all tests, statistical
significance was set at P,0.05.

RESULTS

From 2005 to 2007, we collected 109 blood
samples from 94 adult free-ranging sloths,
including 26 BTSs and 68 HTSs. We collected
45 samples in 2005, 43 in 2006, and 21 in
2007. During physical examinations of 95
sloths, ticks, flies, and moths were present
on most sloths. All sloths recovered from
anesthesia uneventfully.

Serologic results for the 109 samples are
detailed in Table 1, and antibody titers are
summarized in Table 2. Overall, via HI and
CF techniques, 87 of the 109 samples (80%)
were positive for antibody to SLEV. Preva-
lences of detectable antibody to other viruses
were IHLV: 73/109 (67%), PTV: 12/37 (32%),
CGLV: 26/88 (30%), WNV: 12/82 (15%),
VEEV: 12/109 (11%), VSV: 10/109 (9%), and

RGV: 2/21 (10%). Nine of 66 samples (14%)
were positive for VSV by PRNT. Antibodies to
WNV, VSV, and CGLV were detected only in
BTSs. There were no detectable antibodies
found during any sampling period for the
remaining eight viruses.

We sampled 13 sloths during 2 yr, and one
sloth during all 3 yr. Among the recaptured
sloths, 7/13 had a consistent titer for SLEV,
three had increasing titers, two had decreas-
ing titers, and one was antibody negative
during the 3-yr sampling period.

Discrepancies were found between the
results of the HI assays and PRNT80 in four
of 12 serum samples for VEEV and in 41 of 87
positive samples for SLEV antibody. In all
cases, sera were positive for VEEV or SLEV

antibodies via HI, but negative via PRNT80.
Because the PRNT is considerably more
specific, the results obtained by HI in these
cases could reflect cross-reactions with other,
unknown viruses. All of these sloths were
negative for WNV and SLEV antibodies by
PRNT80.

Antibodies to VEEV were found at both
locations, and in both sloth species. During
2006 none of the BTSs were antibody positive.
During 2007, two of three BTSs from the
Upala plantation had antibody to VEEV
enzootic subtype IE. Three of four HTSs
positive for VEEV-IE antibody during 2007
did not have measurable titers for either
subtype IAB or II. The remaining HTS had
a higher titer for VEEV-IE antibody than

either VEEV-IAB or VEEV-II antibodies.
Antibody to Rio Grande virus was detected
in two of 21 individuals via HI in 2007 (Table
2). The positive sloths were one female adult
HTS at Finmac and one female adult BTS at
Upala.

We analyzed changes in antibody preva-
lence for a few viruses. Between 2005 and
2007 there were no significant variations in
prevalence of antibodies to ILHV or SLEV in
either sloth species (P¼0.16–1.0). Between
2005 and 2007, a significant increase in VSV
antibody prevalence was determined in HTSs,
from 4% to 44% (P¼0.001). Between 2005 and
2006, a significant increase in WNV antibody
prevalence from 8% to 27% was measured in
HTSs, (P,0.001) while no WNV antibody-
positive BTSs were detected in either year.

Regarding variations between sloth species,
antibody prevalence was significantly higher
in HTSs compared to BTSs for SLEV and
ILHV in 2005 (P¼0.008), whereas in 2006 and

2007, prevalence was not significantly differ-
ent between sloth species for any of the
screened antibodies. For VEEV and RGV
antibodies, no significant difference was
detected between sloth species. When com-
paring locations, there were no significant
differences in prevalence for any antibodies.

DISCUSSION

We conducted comprehensive serologic
testing in sloths in Costa Rica, confirming
exposure of sloth populations to, at least, eight
arboviruses.

Rio Grande virus

Rio Grande virus was detected in two of 21
sloths but was evaluated only in 2007. These
may represent a cross reaction with a closely
related Phlebovirus or might be true positives.
This virus cross-reacts only rarely with other

Phleboviruses via CF and PRNT (Travassos
da Rosa et al. 1983), but we used IH. To date,
RGV has been isolated in Texas (Calisher et
al. 1977) and Mexico (Deardorff et al. 2011).
Sand flies are vectors of RGV and VSV (Mead
2006), so the presence of these vectors in
Costa Rica (Jimenez et al. 2000a) might be
associated with transmission of both viruses
being described in Costa Rican sloths.

Punta Toro virus

We detected antibody to PTV in 12 of 37
HTSs evaluated only in 2006. Antibodies
against PTV were found in BTSs (8/106) and
HTSs (11/66) in Panama (Seymour et al.
1983c). Unfortunately, PTV and RGV anti-
bodies were not tested during the same years,
and it was not possible to determine whether
some RGV antibody-positive sloths could also
be positive for PTV antibody. This requires
further evaluation.

Vesicular stomatitis virus

Costa Rica is endemic for VSV (Jimenez et
al. 2000b). Similar to a previous study in
Panama (Tesh et al. 1969), we detected
sloths with antibody for the VSV Indiana
serotype. Production of neutralizing anti-
bodies results in cessation of virus shedding
(Mead 2006). Although this has not been
investigated specifically in xenarthrans, the
antibody-positive sloths we detected are
unlikely to represent a source of infection
for other animals. In addition, experimental
studies have shown that biting insects
become infected with VSV when feeding on
or near virus-rich vesicular lesions (Mead
2006), none of which were observed on
physical examinations of VSV antibody-pos-
itive sloths. No sloths had detectable anti-
body to PIRYV, which rules out a cross-
reaction between these two vesiculoviruses.
We found that prevalence of antibody to VSV
increased significantly in HTSs between
2005 and 2007. In addition, all antibody-
positive sloths were from Finmac, which
could reflect the involvement of environ-
mental factors. Climatic conditions in be-
tween sampling areas are different, and

weather variability is also expected in the
same area each year due to the El Niño
southern oscillation. These environmental
parameters could have affected multiple
serologic results. Further work is needed to
investigate whether VSV can have an impact
on free-ranging sloth populations and wheth-
er contact with domestic animals is a factor
associated with seroconversion.

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

Six viral species were described within the
VEE complex (Go et al. 2014), and multiple
variants were described within VEEV, among
which subtypes 1AB and 1C are involved in
equine epizootic outbreaks (Kinney et al.
1992). Bradypus and Choloepus spp. indi-
viduals with antibody to VEEV have been
described in Panama (Grayson and Galindo
1969; Seymour 1985). Following experimen-
tal infection, BTSs develop high titers,
similar to rodents, which are considered the
most important enzootic hosts (Carrara et al.
2007), and their viremias last 5–6 times
longer than in Choloepus spp. Seymour
(1985) suggested that BTSs could be an
amplifying host for VEEV (Seymour 1985).
In South America, reservoir and amplifying
hosts in the VEEV enzootic cycle are
unknown but may include rodents and birds
(Arrigo et al. 2010; Go et al. 2014). In 2007,
two of three BTSs collected at the Upala
plantation had antibody to VEEV-IE. One of
these sloths also had a low titer for both
VEEV-IAB and VEEV-II. Considering the
higher titer for subtype IE, the lower titers
for subtype IAB and subtype II were most
likely due to cross-reactivity of the antibody
responses or to the different serologic test
(PRNT versus HI). A similar observation was
made on one of the four positive HTSs. The
VEEV antibody prevalence did not change
significantly between 2006 and 2007 at
Finmac, suggesting an enzootic virus or long
lasting immunity. It was not possible to
evaluate this hypothesis at the individual
level as no sloth captured in multiple years
was VEEV antibody positive.

Changuinola virus

We found that 30% of HTSs had antibody to
CGLV, with prevalences of 46% and 32% in
2005 and 2006 respectively, versus 0% in BTSs.
This was similar to the findings of Seymour et
al. (1983c) of 42.4% Choloepus spp. and 5.2%
Bradypus spp. Changuinola virus antibody
prevalence in Panama. This prevalence sup-
ports the theory that the primary hosts for this
virus are Choloepus spp. sloths.

Ilheus virus

We found 67% of sloths had antibody to
ILHV compared to 2% in Panama (Seymour
et al. 1983b) and 4% in Brazil (Woodall 1967).
These differences could be due to different
serologic assays, locations, or years. In our
study, individual animals’ titers to ILHV
antibody were always higher than the ILHV
antibody titer using the same samples. In
addition, of the 73 samples positive for ILHV
antibody, all were also positive for SLEV
antibody, in lower titers (�4), suggesting that
HI and CF results may cross-react for SLEV.
A cross-reaction between SLEV and ILHV
antibodies via HI and CF would also explain
that more HTSs than BTSs had detectable
antibody to both viruses.

St. Louis encephalitis virus

Annual prevalence of antibodies to SLEV in
sloths in Costa Rica using HI ranged 29–67%
in BTSs, and from 78% to 89% in HTSs in our
study, which appeared higher than those
reported from Choloepus spp. And Bradypus
spp. in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b).
However, when considering PRNT as the
most specific serologic technique to detect
seroconversion to SLEV, only 53% of the
positive samples were considered true posi-
tives (46 of 87 positive samples by HI),
decreasing the antibody prevalence of to
42%. This result is similar to the prevalence
of 46% reported by PRNT in Choloepus spp.
in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b). For SLEV,
our results were consistent with previous
studies on antibody prevalences in sloths in
Central and South America (Seymour et al.

1983a, b, c; Seymour 1985; Gilmore et al.
2001).

In 2005, antibody prevalences were signif-
icantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs, similar to
findings in Panama (Seymour et al. 1983b),
whereas prevalences were not significantly
different between sloth species during the
following years. However, the BTS sample
sizes in 2006 and 2007 were relatively small in
comparison to 2005, which may have de-
creased the power of the statistical analysis
and led to a type II error. The implications for
public health with respect to the high SLEV
antibody prevalence detected in sloths is
unknown and warrants further monitoring.
In previous studies, no flaviviruses were
isolated in Vero cells from 59 sloths (Seymour
et al. 1983b, c). This could result from sloths
having been exposed, but not viremic at the
time of sampling, and thus may not represent
a source of SLEV transmission (Seymour et al.
1983b, c).

West Nile virus

Our study was performed during the first
few years after WNV reached South America
(Travis 2008). It was therefore relevant to
follow the progression of the number of
antibody-positive sloths and the titers of those
animals. Although WNV infection has been
documented extensively in a wide variety of
mammals (Travis 2008), including horses in
Costa Rica (Hobson-Peters et al. 2011),
antibody prevalence had not been evaluated
in sloths. The prevalence of antibody to WNV
in our study population of HTSs increased
significantly from 2005 to 2006.

Serologic tests for antibodies to other
viruses included in this study were consistent-
ly negative in these sloth populations. This
lack of seroconversion may reflect lack of
exposure, resistance to infection, the limited
number of individuals sampled, or high case
fatality associated with these viruses in sloths.
Regardless, we have evaluated exposure of
Costa Rican sloths to 16 arboviruses and have
now documented seroconversion to VSV and
RGV in sloths. Rio Grande virus infection has
possible implications for livestock and human

health. More studies are needed to evaluate
the impact of these viruses on free-ranging
sloth populations and whether sloths could be
incidentally exposed to VSV due to anthropo-
genic activities involving livestock.

Limitations of this study include the
variability associated with viral testing across
several years, and lack of serologic assay
validation in the two sloth species; hence,
the sensitivity and specificity are unknown.
For example, cross-reactions between SLEV
neutralizing antibodies and ILHV have been
previously described in one BTS (Seymour et
al. 1983a). Therefore, our results should be
interpreted with caution, and further investi-
gations are needed to confirm our findings.
Further studies using PCR and viral culture
are needed to document the actual presence
of these infectious agents, and are required to
investigate the role of sloths in arboviral
sylvatic cycles.

Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is enzootic to In-
dia and maintained in ticks, mammals, and birds. It causes 
severe febrile illness in humans and was first recognized 
in 1957 associated with a high number of deaths among 
monkeys in Kyasanur Forest. Genetic analysis of 48 virus-
es isolated in India during 1957–2006 showed low diversity 
(1.2%). Bayesian coalescence analysis of these sequences 
and those of KFDVs from Saudi Arabia and the People’s 
Republic of China estimated that KFDVs have evolved at 
a mean rate of ≈6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year, which is 
similar to rates estimated for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. 
KFDVs were estimated to have shared a common ancestor 
in ≈1942, fifteen years before identification of the disease in 
India. These data are consistent with the view that KFD rep-
resented a newly emerged disease when first recognized. 
Recent common ancestry of KFDVs from India and Saudi 
Arabia, despite their large geographic separation, indicates 
long-range movement of virus, possibly by birds.

Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a member of the mammalian tick-borne virus group (previously re-
ferred to as the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup) of the 
family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus (1). In addition to 
KFDV, this group contains Louping ill, tick-borne enceph-
alitis, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Langat, Powassan, Royal 
Farm, and Gadgets Gully viruses. KFD was first recog-
nized in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Shimoga District, 
Karnataka State, India, when a disease causing a high num-
ber of deaths was observed in 2 species of monkeys: the 
black-faced langur (Semnopithecus entellus, earlier known 

as Presbytis entellus) and the red-faced bonnet monkey 
(Macaca radiata).

Human cases were also found among persons who 
visited forests to collect firewood, grass, and other forest 
products. Human disease is characterized by an incubation 
period of ≈3–8 days, followed by chills, frontal headache, 
body ache, and high fever for 5–12 days, and a case-fatality 
rate >30% (2). During infection by KFDV, virus titer re-
mains high <10 days after onset of symptoms, as reported 
by Bhat et al. (3). However, Upadhyaya et al. (4) found 
that viremia in patients lasted for 12–13 days of illness and 
unlike most other flaviviruses, remains high during the first 
3–6 days with titers as high as 3.1 × 106 PFU/mL.

Continuing deaths in monkeys and an average of 
400–500 human cases have been seen annually over the 
past 5 decades, commonly occurring in evergreen, semi-
evergreen, and neighboring, moist, deciduous forest areas. 
An array of tick species, mainly Haemaphysalis spinigera, 
act as vectors for KFDV (5). This species of tick is widely 
distributed in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests of 
southern and central India and Sri Lanka. KFDV has also 
been isolated from 7 other species of this genus and from 
Dermacentor and Ixodes ticks. This disease is transmitted 
by ticks among ground birds and small mammals such as 
the white-tailed rat, white-bellied rat, shrew, and bat. High 
titers of virus can be obtained after experimental infection 
of black-napped hares, porcupines, flying squirrels, Ma-
labar giant squirrels, three-striped squirrels, gerbils, mice, 
long-tailed tree mice, and shrews (2–9).

Until 1971, KFDV was endemic to the Sagar, Sorab, 
and Shikaripur taluks (counties) of Shimoga District (Fig-
ure 1). By 1972, a new focus of virus activity appeared in 
Sirsi Taluk, Uttara Kannada District. Many KFDV isolates 
were obtained from Karnataka during 1957–1972 and main-
tained in a repository at the National Institute of Virology

(NIV) in Pune, India. However, the virus was found to be 
highly infectious, as shown by numerous infections in field 
and laboratory personnel (2,10), which resulted in suspen-
sion of work with this virus until an appropriate BioSafety 
Level-3 laboratory was built at NIV in 2004. In 2006, this 
laboratory isolated a virus from a serum sample of a patient 
suspected of having KFD that was obtained from the Virus 
Diagnostic Laboratory in Shimoga.

More recent studies have identified KFDV in Saudi 
Arabia and the People’s Republic of China (11,12). Dur-
ing 1994–1995, a virus was isolated from hemorrhagic 
fever patients in the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia and 
identified as a KFDV variant, referred to as the Alkhurma 
variant or subgroup (11,13,14). The prototype strain of 
KFDV from Saudi Arabia (strain 1176, isolated in 1995) 
and the KFDV reference strain from India (P-9605, iso-
lated in 1957) differ from each another by only 8% at the 
genome nucleotide level, despite their temporal (38 years) 
and geographic (≈4,000 km) separation. A virus initially 
referred to as Nanjianyin virus, isolated in 1989 from a fe-
brile patient in Nanjian County in the Hengduan Mountain 
region of Yunnan Province in southwestern China, was re-
cently identified as a strain of KFDV (12). However, it is 
unclear whether this KFDV 1989 isolate from China is an 
authentic virus isolate because it is virtually identical at the 
nucleotide level with the 1957 reference strain from India 
(P-9605), despite their being isolated 32 years and almost 
3,000 km apart. The P-9605 strain was distributed widely 
to arbovirus reference laboratories. Reference KFDV vi-
rus was used as part of the analysis of serum samples from 
Yunnan Province (15,16).

Results of molecular epidemiologic studies have sug-
gested that tick-borne flaviviruses have evolved slowly 
while dispersing north and west across Asian and European 
forests during the past few millennia (17–19). This pattern 
is different from that of rapidly evolving mosquito-borne 
flaviviruses, many of which can be transported long dis-
tances by migratory birds, persons, animals, or mosquito 
eggs (19,20). We examined the diversity and evolution 
of KFDV and present data that indicated that KFDV iso-
lates from India, Saudi Arabia, and China share a recent 
common ancestor, indicating long-range movement of 
this tick-borne flavivirus. In addition, we also estimated 
the evolution rate of KFDV and compared it with that of 
mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

Methods

Virus Selection and Reverse Transcription–PCR
Forty-seven representative KFDV isolates from In-

dia were chosen for analysis; these isolates were obtained 
during 1957–1972 (Table 1). Isolates represented viruses 
from various host species and different geographic loca-

tions in Shimoga, Uttara Kannada, and Dakshina Kannada 
districts, Karnataka State. One KFDV from India isolated 
in 2006 was also included. Lyophilized KFDV stocks were 
obtained from the virus repository at the NIV, India, and 
grown in Vero E6 cell lines. Primers for PCR and phyloge-
netic analysis were designed to target regions of structural 
genes (premembrane/envelope) and the nonstructural pro-
tein 5 (NS5) gene (viral polymerase) (Table 2).

Total RNA was extracted from 250 µL of infected 
Vero cell lysates by using Trizol reagent (GIBCO-BRL, 
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol. 
RNA was dissolved in 50 µL of nuclease-free water. cDNA 
was prepared separately for structural genes and NS5 by 
using avian Moloney virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, 
Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, 10 pM of each gene-specific 
reverse primer (ER2 and R4 were used for each set of the 
reverse transcription reactions, respectively) and incubated 
at 42°C for 45 min and then 85°C for 5 min.

cDNA was amplified by using 1U of Taq DNA Poly-
merase, 10× PCR buffer (Invitrogen. Carslbad, CA, USA), 
0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10.0 pM of each 
primer pair as described in Table 2 in a reaction volume of 
25 µL. PCR conditions included denaturation at 94°C for 
5 min; 35 cycles of 1-min steps at 94°C, 55°C, and 72°C; 
and a 5-min extension at 72°C. Amplified products were 
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of interest

version 2.1 (Appled Maths, Austin, TX, USA). Sequences 
were processed to give 720 nt of the structural gene (nt 
positions 500–1220) and 620 nt of the NS5 gene (nt po-

appropriate to analyze the 720-nt structural gene fragment 
and 620-nt NS5 gene fragment as a colinearized or con-
catenated single sequence. Phylogenetic analysis was per-
formed on the colinearized sequence from each of the 48 
KFDV isolates from India (Table 1) along with the corre-
sponding gene regions available in GenBank for additional 
KFDVs: a1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from 
China (EU918174, NS5 and EU918175, polyprotein) and 2 
KFDVs from Saudi Arabia isolated in 1995 (AF331718) 
and 2004 (DQ154114).

The Modeltest 3.7 software program (25) was used to 
examine 56 models of nucleotide substitution to determine 
the model most appropriate for Bayesian coalescent analy-
sis of the KFDV dataset. The general time reversible evolu-
tionary model incorporating invariant sites (GTR + I) was 
found to be the best fit to the data according to the Akaike 
information criterion. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was 
conducted by using BEAST, BEAUTi, and Tracer analysis 
software (26) with the GTR + I model. Preliminary analy-
ses were run for 10,000,000 generations to select the clock 
and demographic models most appropriate for the KFDV 
dataset. An analysis of the marginal likelihoods indicated 
that the relaxed lognormal molecular clock and constant 
population size model was decisively chosen (log10 Bayes 
factors of 3.113) for the KFDV dataset. Final data analy-
sis included a Markov chain Monte Carlo chain length of 
50,000,000 generations with sampling every 1,000 states.

Results
Comparison of nucleotide sequences of colinear-

ized fragments of structural (720 nt) and NS5 (620 nt) 
genes of 48 KFDV isolates from India collected over the 

past 5 decades (Table 1) showed a low level of diversity 
among these viruses (GenBank accession nos. EU29242–
EU29337). A maximum of 1.2% nt and 0.5% aa differ-
ences were seen among these viruses; the most divergent 
virus was the A106 virus isolated in 2006. Most viruses 
were isolated during 1957–1972. That the 2006 virus iso-
late is the most divergent is consistent with the 34-year gap 
in sampling. As expected, little diversity was seen among 
the virus isolates irrespective of the host, which included 
humans, black-faced langurs, red-faced bonnet monkeys, 
various tick species (H. spinigera, H. kyasanurensis, H. 
turturis, H. papuana kinneari, H. wellingtoni, H. formo-
sensis, and Ixodes petauristae), and rodents (Rattus rattus 
wroghtoni and R. blanfordi) (Table 1). The sequence of the 
1957 KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and strain 
651521 isolated from an NIV laboratory staff member in 
1965 were identical, despite their 8-year separation. How-
ever, the staff member was accidently infected while han-
dling reference KFDV, which provided an explanation for 
this anomaly.

All KFDV isolates from India differed from the 
Alkhurma variant of KFDV (27) found in Saudi Arabia by 
≈8%–9% at the nucleotide level. This finding is similar to 
the extent of diversity (8%) reported in a comparison of 
the complete genome of a KFDV isolate from India with 
that of an isolate from Saudi Arabia (28). In contrast, the 
1989 KFDV isolate (Nanjianyin) reportedly from China 
(12), differed by only 1 nt (1/1,320 [0.08%]) from the 1957 
KFDV reference strain (P9605) from India and the labo-
ratory infection strain 651521. It is notable that of the 48 
KFDV strains from India analyzed, the KFDV strain from 
China should be most similar to strain P9605, a reference 
strain that was distributed worldwide to arbovirus refer-
ence laboratories. The KFDV 1989 isolate from China is 
virtually identical at the nucleotide level to the 1957 ref-
erence strain (P9605) from India, despite their being iso-
lated 32 years and almost 3,000 km apart, which suggests 
that the strain from China is not an authentic virus isolate. 
A reference KFDV from India appears to have been used 
in the analysis of serum samples from Yunnan Province 
(15,16), which suggests a potential source of laboratory 
cross-contamination. In addition, the 2 sequence fragments

(EU918174 for NS5 and EU918175 for the polyprotein) of 
the KFDV isolate reportedly from China appear to contain 
several sequence analysis errors; neither fragment encodes 
a functional protein because of creation of a stop codon 
and 2 frame shifts relative to KFDV reference sequences 
(AY323490 and EU480689).

Bayesian coalescent analysis of sequence differences 
among the 48 KFDV isolates from India (1957–2006), the 
isolates from Saudi Arabia (1995–2004) (28,29), and the 
reported isolate from China (1989) (12) was conducted to 
estimate the rate of evolution and time to the most recent 
common ancestor (MRCA) for these viruses (Figure 2). 
These viruses were estimated to be evolving at a mean rate 
of 6.4 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year (95% highest probable 
density [HPD] 4.1–8.8 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year). This 
estimate is similar to rates for other flaviviruses analyzed 
by using similar Bayesian coalescent methods, including a 
rate of 2.17 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year obtained for 23 St. 
Louis encephalitis viruses collected during 1933–2001 (30) 
and a rate of 4.2 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year for yellow 
fever virus (31). The finding of similar evolutionary rates 
for tick-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses was unex-
pected, given earlier assertions that evolution of tick-borne 
viruses was more gradual than rapidly evolving mosquito-
borne viruses (19).

Analysis estimated that the mean time to the MRCA 
for all the KFDV isolates was only 64 years (95% HPD 51–
84 years) before 2006 (the year when the most contempo-
rary virus was isolated). The analysis estimated that these 
viruses shared a common ancestor as recently as ≈1942. 
Analysis of only KFDV isolates from India provides a 
slightly more recent estimate of their MRCA (≈1948), just 
9 years before identification of the disease in Kyasanur For-
est in 1957. This finding correlates well with the perception 
of local villagers and healthcare providers in the Kyasa-
nur Forest area that this was a newly emerged disease (32). 
Massive deaths of monkeys or compatible human disease 
in the region were not reported before the 1957 disease out-
break. In the initial years, disease activity was reported in 
a limited area of ≈100 km2 in Sagar and Sorab taluks of 
Shimoga District. However, after 1972, epizootics and epi-
demics were recognized in several new foci, increasingly 
more distant from the original focus.

Discussion
Most viruses analyzed were isolated in various small 

hamlets from migrating persons within the early enzoot-
ic zone in the Shimoga District (until 1972). Attempts to 
examine the relationship between genetic differences in a 
virus isolate relative to geographic location did not show 
any notable findings because of small differences and dis-
tances involved. However, the 1972 virus 72166 was iso-
lated from a tick in the village of Gadgeri in Sirsi (Uttara 

Kannada District), which is north of Shimoga District. The 
2006 virus A106 was isolated from a person south of Shi-
moga District, in Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada District) 
and further from the original virus epicenter (Figure 1). 
Although much of the topology of the virus phylogenetic 
tree generated by Bayesian coalescent analysis is poorly 
supported (nodal support posterior probability values <95), 
there is support for a branch that contains the 72166 1972 
and the A106 2006 virus isolates (Figure 2). These data 
suggest that there may be an association between virus ge-
netic divergence and temporal and geographic spread of 
KFDV in Karnataka, consistent with the concept of virus 
spreading over time from an initial focus of activity. Why 
this initial focus of virus activity occurred in this location 
and at this time remains unclear, but speculation includes 
emergence of the virus from a cryptic forest cycle caused by

changes in land use or introduction of the virus from else-
where by birds. A more complete picture should emerge 
with analysis of additional virus samples (particularly from 
the post-1973 period) and complete virus genomes.

Bayesian analysis estimates that the 1995 and 2004 
KFDV isolates from Saudi Arabia shared a common an-
cestor in 1992. The node connecting these viruses with the 
2006 KFDV isolate from India was in 1977, and a strongly 
supported node (1.0) shows that the 1972 and 2006 KFDV 
isolates from India shared a common ancestor with the 
viruses from Saudi Arabia in ≈1969. The simplest inter-
pretation of these data and the epidemiologic observations 
would be that KFDV was introduced from India into Saudi 
Arabia in the late 1970s or the 1980s.

Similar findings of low genetic diversity and recent 
common ancestry were reported for the KFDVs from Saudi 
Arabia in a more limited study of 11 virus isolates collected 
over a 5-year period (1994–1999). Only 0.4%, 0.6%, and 
0.9% genetic diversity were found in the E, NS3, and NS5 
gene fragments of these isolates, respectively (27). Using 
these gene fragments along with those of the complete ge-
nome sequence of KFDV from India, the authors estimated 
divergence time by using an older method based on dis-
tance analysis of nonsynonymous substitutions. This esti-
mate indicated recent ancestry of these viruses. The KFDV 
strains from Saudi Arabia were estimated to have diverged 
from one another over a 4–72 year period and the KFDVs 
from India and Saudi Arabia were estimated to have di-
verged 66–177 years ago (27).

It is unclear what factors influenced the apparent emer-
gence of KFDV in Shimoga District, India, in 1957 and in 
the Makkah/Jeddah region in Saudi Arabia in 1994. Also 
unknown is how this tick-borne virus moved over the large 
distance between these regions. A considerable amount of 
knowledge has been accumulated with regard to the ecol-
ogy of KFDV in India (32). The natural history of the 
virus is complex and involves dynamic cycles of various 
life stages of Ixodid ticks (primarily H. spinigera, but also 
other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks and Ixodes ticks) and am-
plifying (vertebrate) hosts, including rodents and shrews, 
and possibly monkeys and cattle. Increased human popula-
tions in the Sagar and Sorab taluks in the early 1950s may 
have been the primary catalyst for emergence of KFD in 
1957. During 1951–1961, the population of Sagar Taluk 
increased 116%, bringing with it increases in deforestation, 
cattle grazing, and extension of paddy fields and cleared 
grazing areas deeper into previously forested areas (32). 
Expansion of the cattle population may have been a cru-
cial factor because cattle harbor adult forms of H. spinigera 
ticks, and an association between cattle and increases in tick 
larval density has been described (32). Cattle also carry all 
life stages of other Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, which have 
been shown to be infected with KFDV. Thus, cattle would 

likely increase tick densities in cleared forest areas most 
frequented by humans. In addition, rats, shrews, and mice 
are highly susceptible to KFDV infection, and numerous 
virus isolates have been obtained from organs of infected 
animals (33). Changes in land use and population densities 
may have resulted in emergence of KFDV from a cryptic 
enzootic cycle in this previously heavily forested area.

A high percentage of birds in the affected area are pos-
itive for antibodies reactive with KFDV and infested with 
Haemaphysalis spp. and other tick genera, particularly lar-
vae and nymphs (32). It is unclear whether birds play a 
role in the complex virus maintenance cycle in an enzootic 
zone, but birds carrying virus-infected ticks or migration 
of viremic birds could spread KFDV over large distances 
such as those separating areas of KFDV activity in India 
and Saudi Arabia (19,34). There is serologic evidence of 
KFDV, or a related flavivirus in the mammalian tick-borne 
virus group, in Saurashtra, Gujarat State, on the coast of 
India on the Arabian Sea and in birds captured outside Kar-
nataka State (2,10,32).

The current known distribution of KFDV is limited 
to relatively restricted areas of India and Saudi Arabia. 
However, it is likely that the virus exists in other areas 
in cryptic enzootic cycles or is associated with unrecog-
nized or undiagnosed disease. This finding, together with 
the distance separating the KFDV-affected areas in India 
and Saudi Arabia, despite their relatively recent common 
ancestry, suggests that KFD has the potential to flare up 
in other regions because of virus movement or ecologic 
changes in the area. Clinicians should consider KFD in 
a differential diagnosis when considering acute febrile 
cases with compatible symptoms in other regions of Asia 
and the Middle East.

Abstract: Although resource specialization occurs along a continuum, species are often defined as either specialists or
generalists. In general, specialists are more prone to extinction than generalists and, thus, are often the first species
to be lost when habitats are modified. The two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and the three-toed sloth (Bradypus
variegatus) are arboreal herbivores distributed across the Neotropics. The two-toed sloth is considered a generalist
while the three-toed sloth is more specialized. Both species inhabit shade-grown agro-ecosystems but, at least at one
study site, only the two-toed sloth was viable. To quantify specialization in sloth species and explore how it influences
population viability, we characterized the resource use for 68 adult and 12 subadult sloths across 3 y. The two-toed
sloth used 14 tree species relatively uniformly across habitats, while the three-toed sloth largely depended on only
two species of tree regardless of habitat type. Both species selected for patches of intact tropical forest, strongly avoided
monocultures regardless of spatial scale and generally used cocoa similarly in proportion to availability. However, the
sloth species differed in their use of cattle pastures, with the two-toed sloth selecting for pastures and the three-toed
sloth avoiding them. Overall, the two-toed sloth exhibited greater plasticity in tree and habitat use, which is likely
contributing to its enhanced resilience within this modified agro-ecosystem.

INTRODUCTION

Resource use and overlap plays a central role in the
structuring of vertebrate communities. The mechanisms
by which organisms partition resources typically involve
differentiation in some combination of habitat use (at
both fine and coarse scales), timing of activity and diet.
Differences in niche-breadth among competing species
are ultimately the result of an evolutionary trade-off
between the ability to exploit a wide base of resources
and the efficient use of each one (Futuyma & Moreno
1988, MacArthur 1972). Although species occur along
a continuum of niche breadth, they are often considered
simply as specialists or generalists (Clavel et al. 2010,
Julliard et al. 2006). These two resource acquisition
strategies have been associated with important life-

history traits: in general, specialists have lower dispersal
capacities (Brouat et al. 2004), and are more susceptible
to stochasticity and environmental change (Clavel et al.
2010, Sol et al. 2002) than generalists. As a consequence,
resource specialists are typically more prone to extinction
than generalists, and often the first species to be lost when
habitats are modified (Boyles & Storm 2007, Dunn et al.
2009, Laurance 1991).

Sloths are mid-sized (2.0–4.5 kg) arboreal mammals
that spend the majority of their time in forest canopies. The
two phylogenetic groups of sloth, two- (Choloepus spp.)
and three-toed sloths (Bradypus spp.), diverged roughly
18–40 Mya (Delsuc et al. 2001, Gaudin 2004), co-
occur across much of their distributional range and are
ecologically quite different (Pauli et al. 2014). Although
both are arboreal folivores, previous authors have broadly
described the two-toed sloth as a generalist, inhabiting
a range of habitat types and consuming leaves from a
number of species as well as augmenting their diet with

non-leaf items (e.g. fruits, flowers and animal matter)
and possessing large home ranges; the three-toed sloth is
considered more specialized, foraging on only leaves from
a small number of tree species to the point that individuals
appear capable of surviving on a single or a few tree
species (Chiarello 2008, Gilmore et al. 2001, Montgomery
& Sunquist 1975, 1978; Pauli et al. 2014). Both two-
and three-toed sloths use shade-grown agro-ecosystems
(Vaughan et al. 2007) but in one well-studied system,
only the two-toed sloth appears capable of maintaining
self-sustaining populations in such habitats, while the
three-toed sloth is only viable in the face of immigration
from surrounding areas (Peery & Pauli 2014).

Herein, we determined resource use and overlap for
syntopic populations of two- (C. hoffmanni) and three-
toed sloth (B. variegatus) in the same shade-grown
agro-ecosystem where viability analyses were conducted
(Peery & Pauli 2014) to explore whether greater habitat
and resource specialization by the three-toed sloth could
be contributing to its relatively low viability in this
altered landscape (Peery & Pauli 2014). Specifically, we
quantified tree use and macro-habitat selection for both
two- and three-toed sloths across a range of different
habitats present within the agro-ecosystem. We predicted
that diversity of tree species used would be greatest in
tropical forests, intermediate in shade-grown cocoa, and
lowest in pasture for both species and that the three-toed
sloth would exhibit stronger selection for patches of intact
forest and greater avoidance of cattle pastures than the
two-toed sloth.

METHODS

Study area

Fieldwork was conducted in and around a privately
owned organic shade-grown cocoa (Theobroma cacao)
farm, in north-eastern Costa Rica (10.32°N, 83.59°W;
Figure 1). The region possesses a wet and warm climate
featuring a rainy season from mid- or late-April to
January, which is briefly interrupted by a dry period in
August or September (Holdridge 1967, Janzen 1983). The
study area occurs within an agricultural landscape that
contains five habitat types: (1) cocoa trees grown under
overstorey of native and non-native trees, (2) tropical
forest occurring in narrow (�20 m) riparian buffers and
small patches, (3) cattle pastures with scattered trees,
(4) monocultures of cultivated crops, and (5) human
development (i.e. housing) that border the study area. We
used 2013 RapidEye satellite imagery (IntraSearch Inc.)
with 5-m resolution and five-band multispectral imagery
to visually digitize polygons representing these habitat
types using ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).

Animal captures

For this study we captured adult two-toed (n = 36)
and three-toed sloths (n = 32), and subadult sloths
(n = 4; n = 8, respectively) by hand from trees from
February 2010 to January 2013. Captured individuals
were classified as subadults or adults based on body mass
described by Peery & Pauli (2014). Each individual was
marked with uniquely coded PIT tags (Biomark, Boise,
ID) inserted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades.
Additionally, adult males of adequate size were fitted with
radio-collars (Mod-210, Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA)
to track their movement, and adult females were fitted
with uniquely identifiable colour collars. All sloths were
relocated every 1–10 d (with a minimum of 24 h between
relocations) and the majority (98%) of all sloth relocations
occurred during daylight hours.

Tree use

We classified tree use based on the tree species occupied
by an individual at the time of relocation and proportion
of species used was calculated for each sloth. Tree
species were identified with aid of Zuchowski (2007) and
following the nomenclature of Hammel et al. (2003). We
used a likelihood ratio test for goodness-of-fit to compare
tree use between the two sloth species. Using these data,
we also characterized the diversity of tree species used
by each individual and by all individuals pooled for each
species with Simpson’s index of diversity.

Habitat selection

We characterized second- and third-order habitat
selection to identify habitat characteristics preferred by
the two- and the three-toed sloth (Johnson 1980). Second-
order habitat selection reflects the habitat features that
individuals use to select the location of their home range,
whereas third-order selection reflects the habitat features
that individuals preferentially use within their home
range. For this analysis, we only included individuals
that had a minimum of 16 relocations and that were
not dispersing from their home range. We estimated
home ranges using 90% fixed kernel methods for 34
adult resident two-toed sloths (median = 64 relocations;
range: 16–179) and 33 (n = 30 adults; n = 3 subadults)
three-toed sloths (median = 50 relocations; range = 20–
212). Home ranges were delineated using ESRI’s ArcGIS
10.1 and the Geospatial Modelling Environment with
least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) as the smoothing
parameter (Millspaugh & Marzluff 2001). To evaluate
second-order habitat selection, we considered used
habitat as the proportion of each habitat type in each

sloth’s home range. We treated available habitat as the
proportion of each habitat type within the Minimum
Convex Polygon (MCP) of all sloths relocations of a given
species (i.e. pooled across individuals). Within the MCP,
we calculated available habitat in two different ways:
(1) as the proportion of all five habitats (cocoa, tropical
forest, pastures, monocultures and human development)
and (2) excluding the least-used habitats (monocultures

and human development). Monocultures and human
development habitats were excluded from the second
analysis as sloths are predominantly observed in cocoa,
tropical forest and cattle pastures, and rarely utilize
monocultures or human development (Vaughan et al.
2007). To test for third-order habitat selection, we
considered used habitat to be the proportion of relocations
that occurred in each habitat. We quantified available

habitat by generating random points within each sloth’s
home range (where the number of points was equal to
the number of observed relocations) and calculated the
proportion of locations occurring in each habitat type.
We used Manly’s Alpha preference index to test for habitat
selection at both levels across all individuals (Manly et al.
2002). We inferred selection for a particular habitat type
if the observed index exceeded the expected value and did
not overlap in the 95% CI. Conversely, we inferred that
sloths avoided a habitat type if the observed index was less
than the expected values and did not overlap in the 95%
CI.

RESULTS

Tree use

The three-toed sloth heavily utilized only two species –
Cecropia obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa – while the two-
toed sloth frequented Inga vera slightly more than the
other 14 tree species (Figure 2a, b). The difference in tree
use was significantly different between the two species

of sloth (χ2 = 2330, df = 14, P < 0.001). Tree-species
use differed by habitat type for the three most commonly
used habitats (forest, cocoa and pasture) in both three-
toed sloth (χ2 = 515, df = 18, P < 0.001) and two-toed
sloth (χ2 = 714, df = 28, P < 0.001). The two-toed sloth
utilized a greater diversity of trees than the three-toed
sloth at both the individual- (t78 = 2.98, P = 0.004) and
population-level (Table 1). The diversity of trees used by
the two-toed sloth was also higher within cocoa compared
with the three-toed sloth at the individual (t78 = 5.65,
P < 0.001), and population level (Table 1).

Habitat selection

The most abundant habitat types within our study
area were cocoa, pastures and monocultures, while
tropical forest and human development were the least
abundant (Table 2). Median home range size was 7.5 ha
(range = 0.6–101.1 ha) and 5.3 ha (range = 0.1–53.3
ha) for the two- and the three-toed sloth, respectively.
Both species of sloth exhibited second-order habitat
selection for tropical forests and avoided monocultures
and human development (Figure 3a). However, the two-
toed sloth also selected pastures, while the three-toed
sloth avoided this habitat type. When we excluded rarely
used monocultures and human development from our
analyses, the two-toed sloth selected for tropical forest but
avoided cocoa; the three-toed sloth selected for tropical
forest, and avoided both cocoa and pastures (Figure 3b).
Within home ranges (i.e. third-order habitat selection)
both the two- and the three-toed sloth selected for tropical
forest (Figure 3c), while the three-toed sloth avoided
cocoa and strongly avoided pastures (Figure 3c).

DISCUSSION

As predicted, the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity
of tree species and was more plastic in its use of
habitats at multiple spatial scales. In contrast, the three-
toed sloth exhibited a strong dependence on intact
tropical forest and on only two species of tree (Cecropia

obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa). Interestingly, these two
tree species were the least used by the two-toed sloth,
perhaps a strategy used to avoid interspecific competition.
Differences in tree use for the two sloth species appear to
depend on the ability of each species to adapt to human
modifications; for example, the two-toed sloth generally
used the non-native species Erythrina poeppigiana in
pastures, while we did not observe any three-toed sloths
using this tree species. Overall, the diversity of tree use was
somewhat dependent on habitat type, and was similar
for both sloth species in riparian forests and pastures,
which could be due to the differential availability of
trees in the two habitats. On one hand, the richness of
trees within intact tropical rain forests is highest and
sloths of both species have access to a great number of
different tree species. On the other hand, the paucity of
tree species within pastures limits the diversity of tree use
for both species of sloth. In the habitat where we observed
a difference in the diversity of tree use – shade-grown
cocoa – the two-toed sloth used a greater diversity of
trees compared with the three-toed sloth. This difference
is likely due to limited availability of trees preferred by
three-toed sloths, especially the scarcity of secondary trees
like Nectandra salicifolia and Ocotea sinuata, leading to
particularly strong dependence on Cecropia obtusifolia and
Coussapoa villosa in shade-grown cocoa (pers. obs).

Both species of sloth selected intact tropical forests,
exhibited neutrality or slight avoidance of shade-
grown cocoa, and strongly avoided monocultures and
human development. These findings are not particularly
surprising, as previous researchers have shown that
sloths are largely intolerant of monocultures, and select
for habitats with structural complexity and intact forest
canopies (Rolim & Chiarello 2004, Vaughan et al. 2007).
The neutrality or avoidance (depending on scale and how
rarely used habitats were treated) towards shade-grown
cocoa was expected for the three-toed sloth but not for
the two-toed sloth, especially since the two-toed sloth
is frequently observed in cocoa. Vaughan et al. (2007)
suggested that the three-toed sloth uses shade-grown
cocoa in proportion to its availability whereas the two-
toed sloth uses it less than expected. A factor that may
explain differences of our results from previous studies is
that Vaughan et al. (2007), quantified living fences (in
and around the shade-grown cocoa) as a discrete habitat

type, and found sloths selected strongly for the fencerows
and avoided the cocoa. We choose to pool cocoa and
living fences into a more generalized shade-grown cover
type to minimize potential GPS and remote sensing error,
especially since living fences are extraordinarily narrow
(i.e. 1–5 m), and because we believe that fencerows are an
implicit and important component of shade-grown cocoa
(Chacón & Harvey 2006).

The two-toed sloth used pastures in proportion to
availability within their home range, while the three-toed
sloth avoided this habitat; we presume that the three-toed
sloth avoids pastures due to the lack of closed canopies
and a dearth of suitable tree species. Additionally, the
three-toed sloth may avoid pastures to evade the risk
of predation by coyote (Canis latrans) and domestic dog
(Canis lupus familiaris), as this species is more vulnerable
to ground predators given its smaller size and more docile
behaviour (Peery & Pauli 2014). In contrast, the two-toed
sloth may be better adapted to pastures since it possesses
greater mobility and is able to move on the ground in
between trees (Sunquist & Montgomery 1973).

Overall, our findings suggest that the two-toed sloth
is flexible in its use of trees and habitat selection
compared with the more specialized three-toed sloth.
This greater plasticity in two-toed sloth resource use
is likely contributing to its enhanced viability within
an agro-ecosystem containing shade-grown elements.
Conversely, specialization on a few tree species and
avoidance of pastures containing isolated trees seems
likely to have contributed to the three-toed sloth’s reduced
viability in an agro-ecosystem containing only a fraction
of the original forest.

More broadly, our results indicate that some generalists
are more resilient to the conversion of tropical forests
to shade-grown agricultural systems than specialists,
even in closely related species. Thus, while shade-grown
systems, such as those of cocoa or coffee (Coffea spp.),
can harbour a greater diversity of animal species across
a range of taxa compared with monocultures (Cassano
et al. 2011, Clough et al. 2011, Delabie et al. 2007),
by themselves they may be insufficient to harbour some
resource specialists. Previous studies have shown that
the amount of biodiversity retained in shade-grown agro-
ecosystems is positively related to tree density, species
composition and diversity (Clough et al. 2011, Schroth

resource specialists. Moreover, landscape context is likely
critical for maintaining sensitive species (Pardini et al.
2009), where the juxtaposition of intact forest to provide
a source of immigrants is required to maintaining the full

array of species. Our study area, comprised of intact forest,
pastures, shade-grown agriculture and monocultures,
seems to be a microcosm for much of Costa Rica and
Central America (Brown & Lugo 1990, Janzen 1983,
Myers 1991, Sader & Joyce 1988) and may provide insight
into how different forms of human altered landscapes may
favour certain species over others.

ABSTRACT: We documented the antibody
prevalence to three arboviruses, St. Louis
encephalitis virus (SLEV), eastern equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV), and West Nile virus
(WNV), in Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheri-
way; n580) in Florida from 2007 to 2008.
Antibody prevalence to WNV was higher (9%)
than for the other viruses. Most seropositive
birds were adults ($3 yr of age), with 55% of
adults testing positive for antibodies to at least
one virus. Adults were significantly more likely
to have antibodies to WNV than nonadults
(P,0.001). Prevalence of SLEV and EEEV
antibodies among Crested Caracaras was 3%
for each virus, and three adult caracaras had
indistinguishable anti-flavivirus antibodies. The
susceptibility of Crested Caracaras to adverse
effects of WNV, SLEV, or EEEV infection
remains unknown; however, we observed that
some free-ranging individuals survived infec-
tion and successfully fledged young. Knowl-
edge of arboviral infection among Florida’s
Crested Caracara, which is both state and
federally threatened, is valuable considering
increasing pressure on this population from
rapid and extensive habitat alterations.

Key words: Antibody, Crested Caracara,
Caracara cheriway, eastern equine encephali-
tis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis encephalitis
virus, West Nile virus.

Birds are important virus-amplifying
hosts for numerous arboviruses (Stamm,
1966), some of which may adversely affect
the health of free-ranging birds (McLean
and Ubico, 2007). This is a particular
concern for state and federally threatened
species, such as the Crested Caracara
(Caracara cheriway, hereafter, caracara;
family Falconidae). The caracara is the only
caracara species in North America, and a
small, isolated population resides in Florida.

Numerous arboviruses circulate within the
caracara’s Florida range, including West
Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis
virus (SLEV; both in the family Flavivi-
ridae, genus Flavivirus), and eastern equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV; family Togavi-
ridae, Genus Alphavirus) (Day and Stark,
1996; Blackmore et al., 2003). To our
knowledge, WNV, SLEV, and EEEV in-
fections have not been documented in
caracaras. We sampled caracaras in Florida
and tested their sera for specific anti-WNV,
-SLEV, and -EEEV antibodies to deter-
mine antibody prevalence rates and to
assess potential age and sex associations
with seroprevalence.

We sampled caracaras from April 2007 to
August 2008. Flighted caracaras were
captured via a phai trap (Beebe and
Webster, 1964) modified to accommodate
carrion as bait; recently fledged birds were
caught by hand. Blood (0.2–0.6 ml) was
collected from the ulnar vein of each bird,
placed into serum separator tubes, and held
at ambient temperature for 1–4 hr before
transfer to an iced cooler for 1–4 hr.
Thereafter, blood was clarified by centrifu-
gation (2,250 3 G for 10 min), and sera
were stored at 220 C until testing, except
when shipped on ice to Colorado State
University (Fort Collins, Colorado, USA).

Birds were aged based on the coloration
of breast feathers; those with breast
feathers fully or partially streaked were
categorized as ‘‘nonadult’’ (i.e., subadult,
juvenile, or fledgling), and birds with fully
barred breast feathers were categorized as

‘‘adult’’ (Wheeler and Clark, 2003). Non-
adult birds were #2 yr old, and adults
were $3 yr old (Dwyer, unpubl. data). Sex
was determined for each bird through
DNA analysis (Avian Biotech Internation-
al, Tallahassee, Florida, USA).

Plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT), using Vero cell monolayers in
six-well plates (Beaty et al., 1995), was
used to detect antibodies to WNV, SLEV,
and EEEV. Before testing, serum samples
were heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min.
Sera were initially tested at a serum
dilution of 1:10 in BA-1 medium (M199-
Hank’s salts, 1% bovine serum albumin,
350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/
ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and
2.5 mg/ml amphotericin B in 0.05 M Tris,
pH 7.6). The PRNT challenge dose was
approximately 100 plaque-forming units of
the following strains: WNV NY99-4132
(originally isolated from crow brain in
New York, USA), SLEV TBH-28 (origi-
nally isolated from human brain in Tampa,
Florida, USA), and EEEV FL93 (original-
ly isolated from mosquitoes in Florida).
Known anti-WNV and anti-SLEV anti-
body-positive chicken sera and anti-EEEV
horse serum served as positive controls in
the respective neutralization assays.

Serum samples with $90% neutraliza-
tion at a 1:10 dilution were considered
positive for anti-viral antibodies, and
positive samples were serially diluted
(twofold) to determine reciprocal end-
point 90% neutralization (PRNT90) titers.
A fourfold or greater titer of either anti-
WNV or anti-SLEV antibodies indicated

that particular virus as the etiologic agent
of infection. Sera from three individuals
were positive for antibodies to both SLEV
and WNV, but we could not demonstrate a
fourfold or greater titer of either WNV or
SLEV, so these individuals were consid-
ered flavivirus positive.

We tested 80 caracaras from 10 counties
for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, and EEEV.
Sampled birds included 58 nonadults (25
juveniles and 33 subadults) and 22 adults,
composed of 47 (59%) females and 33
(41%) males. Fisher’s exact test was used
to test for differences in antibody preva-
lence rates between adults and nonadults.

Antibodies to WNV were detected in
seven (9%) of the caracaras. Most (55%
[12/22]) of the adults were seropositive for
at least one arbovirus, whereas 2% (1/58)
of nonadults were seropositive (one juve-
nile was positive for antibodies to EEEV).
Among adults, one (5%) and two individ-
uals (9%) were seropositive for EEEV and
SLEV, respectively, whereas three adults
(14%) had antibodies to flaviviruses that
could not be differentiated as either WNV
or SLEV (Table 1). One adult had anti-
bodies to both SLEV and EEEV. Among
adults, 66% (7/11) of females and 46% (5/
11) of males were positive for antibodies
to one or more arboviruses. Serum
PRNT90 antibody titers were from 20 to
80, and seropositive caracaras were cap-
tured in six counties (Collier, DeSoto,
Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin;
Fig. 1).

Adults were significantly more likely to
have anti-WNV antibodies than were

nonadults (n580, df51, P,0.001), re-
gardless of whether flavivirus antibody-
positive birds were considered positive or
negative for WNV. We found no differ-
ence in arbovirus seroprevalence by sex in
adults (n522, df51, P50.669) or across all
ages (n580, df51, P51.000). Similarly,
there was no difference in WNV sero-
prevalence by sex in adults (n522, df51,
P51.000) or across all ages (n580, df51,
P51.000). Seven seropositive adults were
providing parental care to dependent
fledged young when these adults were
sampled. We observed feather mites, lice,
or both, and superficial abrasions on the
faces of some of the birds sampled, but all
birds seemed to be in general good health,
were flight capable, and were foraging
normally when captured.

West Nile virus was first detected in

Florida in 2001, at which time antibody
prevalence among 10 species of free-
ranging birds, including passeriforms,
columbiforms, and one falconiform (a
Red-shouldered Hawk, Buteo lineatus),
was 10.5% (n5152) in Jefferson County,
Florida, and Lowndes County, Georgia,
USA (Godsey et al., 2005). Both SLEV
and EEEV were first reported in Florida
in 1952; antibody prevalence rates were
1.3% for EEEV and 0.5% for SLEV
(n55,295) among free-ranging birds sam-
pled from 1965 to 1974 (Bigler and Hoff,
1975; Bigler et al., 1976). Arbovirus
seroprevalence rates observed among ca-
racaras in south-central Florida in the
present study are consistent with these
previous studies.

West Nile virus has led to unprecedent-
ed mortality in native North American

located in Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Martin counties.

birds (Marra et al., 2004), whereas fatal
EEEV and SLEV infections have been
less commonly reported (McLean and
Bowen, 1980; Main et al., 1988). Numer-
ous raptors, including members of the
family Falconidae, are susceptible to
WNV infection and disease, although
susceptibility varies among species (Joyner
et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2007; Nemeth et
al., 2009). Serologic surveys of free-
ranging raptors in Wisconsin, California,
and Pennsylvania in the USA revealed
healthy, free-ranging seropositive individ-
uals (Stout et al., 2005; Hull et al., 2006;
Medica et al., 2007). Raptors are poten-
tially exposed to WNV via mosquitoes and
oral infection from prey (Nemeth et al.,
2006). In our study, caracaras seropositive
for WNV, EEEV, SLEV, or a combina-
tion, seemed healthy, although individuals
that may have died from infection are not
accounted for in serologic surveys.

Arboviruses are maintained in enzootic
cycles between birds and mosquitoes, and
exposure of free-ranging animals depends
on many factors, including habitat, season,
weather, contact rates between vectors
and hosts, and host and vector abundance
(Stamm, 1966; Day, 2005). Caracaras in
Florida primarily inhabit drained grass-
land and pasture habitats that are usually
adjacent to drainage ditches, where mos-
quitoes often are abundant (Morrison and
Humphrey, 2001; Diuk-Wasser et al.,
2006). Breeding caracaras are nonmigra-
tory and live in pairs on defended
territories throughout the year. Nonbreed-
ing caracaras are vagrant throughout
south-central Florida and aggregate at
communal roosts that may consist of
.200 individuals during the wet season
(approximately late May to October;
Dwyer et al., unpubl. data). Transmission
rates are potentially high within commu-
nal roosts, as evidenced in American crows
(Corvus brachyrhynchos) in east-central
Illinois (Yaremych et al., 2004; Ward et al.,
2006). However, we found little evidence
of arbovirus infection in caracaras #2 yr
of age. Limited evidence for WNV infec-

tion in younger birds could be partially
explained by apparently low levels of WNV
transmission in counties within our study
area in recent years (http://diseasemaps.
usgs.gov/wnv_historical.html). In addition,
longer lived resident animals, such as the
Crested Caracaras (Morrison, 2003), may
be more likely to encounter an infectious
mosquito during their lifetime than either
shorter lived animals or animals that
migrate to regions where mosquito vectors
are inactive for part of the year.

In the present study, antibodies to
arboviruses were more common in adult
caracaras than in younger birds, although
the timing of initial infection is unknown.
This result is consistent with other studies
in which antibody prevalence rates of
WNV and other arboviruses were higher
among free-ranging adult birds than youn-
ger individuals (Garvin et al., 2004;
Beveroth et al., 2006). Garvin et al.
(2004) hypothesized that young Blue Jays
(Cyanocitta cristata) may succumb to
EEEV infection and therefore may not
be represented in seroprevalence studies,
and there is evidence that young birds of
some species are more susceptible to
WNV-associated morbidity and mortality
than older birds (Austin et al., 2004;
Nemeth and Bowen, 2007; Nemeth et
al., 2008). Both adult and juvenile caraca-
ras had relatively high estimated annual
survival (89.1 and 69.4%, respectively)
before the arrival of WNV to Florida
(1994–2000; Morrison, 2003); however,
whether infection with WNV or other
arboviruses affects survival of this species
remains unknown.

We demonstrated that some free-rang-
ing caracaras survive infection with WNV
and other arboviruses with no apparent
reductions in fecundity. However, Flor-
ida’s population of caracaras faces a variety
of challenges, including geographic isola-
tion and human-induced alterations of
nesting and foraging habitat (Morrison
and Humphrey, 2001). Changes in land
use may affect caracara behavior, as well
as mosquito density and distribution,

potentially leading to increased caracara-
vector contact, and therefore more oppor-
tunities for arbovirus transmission. Fur-
ther studies are warranted to ascertain
whether caracaras suffer negative effects
from arboviral infection, and particularly
WNV.

ABSTRACT: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
and West Nile virus (WNV) are emerging
zoonotic arboviruses that have recently under-
gone intercontinental expansion. Both JEV and
WNV are naturally transmitted between mos-
quito vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts,
including birds. A potential route of JEV
introduction from Asia to western North
America is via the Hawaiian archipelago, while
the spread of WNV from mainland North
America to Hawai‘i is also considered an
impending threat. We surveyed resident, non-
native bird sera for antibodies to JEV and WNV
on two Hawaiian Islands from 2004–2005.
Three of 1,835 birds (0.16%) had evidence of
antiflavivirus antibodies, demonstrating neu-
tralizing activity to JEV and St. Louis enceph-
alitis virus (SLEV). These detections could
represent a limited transmission focus of either,
or both, JEV and SLEV, or cross-reactive
antibodies due to primary infection with an
alternate flavivirus. Frequent air traffic from
both Asia and North America to Hawai‘i, along
with the presence of probable competent
vectors and amplifying vertebrate hosts in
Hawai‘i, increases the likelihood of introduction
and maintenance of novel flaviviruses. There-
fore, it is important to monitor for the presence
of these viruses.

Key words: Bird, Hawai‘i, Japanese en-
cephalitis virus, seroprevalence, St. Louis
encephalitis virus, West Nile virus.

Hawai‘i and other remote islands are
particularly vulnerable to the introduction
of novel wildlife pathogens because of
immunologically naı̈ve vertebrate host
populations. Peridomestic mosquitoes
were introduced to Hawai‘i with the
arrival of European human settlers and,
as a result, devastating mosquito-borne
pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium relictum [avi-
an malaria] and Avipoxvirus [avian pox])
decimated native avian populations (La-
Pointe, 2007). Japanese encephalitis virus

and West Nile virus (JEV and WNV,
respectively; family Flaviviridae, genus
Flavivirus) are globally emerging mosqui-
to-borne viruses that cause fatal enceph-
alitis in humans and other vertebrates and
could pose a significant threat to the state
of Hawai‘i (Kilpatrick et al., 2004; Mack-
enzie et al., 2004). Similar to WNV, JEV is
transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, with
birds as amplifying hosts. It is thought that
WNV may have arrived in the United
States via an infected mosquito or verte-
brate host (Gubler, 2007); similarly, these
mechanisms have likely contributed to the
geographic spread of JEV (Mackenzie et
al., 2004).

Because of the risk of introduction of
novel arboviruses to Hawai‘i, we screened
free-ranging, resident birds for serologic
evidence of past infection with several
arboviruses within the Japanese encepha-
litis serocomplex including JEV, WNV,
and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV).
Our objective was to determine the serum
antibody prevalence of WNV and JEV
among birds captured primarily at sites
that receive frequent air traffic. We
hypothesized that a local transmission
focus could initiate if one of these viruses
arrived via a viremic human or other
vertebrate, or via an infected mosquito
associated with air travel. Serologic evi-
dence of flavivirus infection among resi-
dent birds may be suggestive of local
transmission and would help establish
baseline antibody prevalence for future
research and surveillance efforts.

Resident birds were mist-netted year-
round from June 2004–December 2005 at
various sites on the islands of Oahu

(Barber’s Point, Dillingham Airfield,
Hickam Airfield, Honolulu Airport, Ka-
laeloa, and Kewalo; approximately 21uN,
157–158uW) and Maui (Kahului Airport;
20u549N, 156u269W). Blood was collected
by venipuncture of the jugular vein
(approximately 0.1–0.2 ml) and either left
undiluted or diluted 1:10 in phosphate
buffered saline with 0.75% bovine serum
albumin. Blood samples were centrifuged
at 10,000 3 G for 3 min, and sera were
aliquotted into separate vials, heat inacti-
vated at 56 C for 30 min, and stored at
220 or 280 C.

Sera were screened at the Hawai‘i
Department of Health Laboratory
(HDHL), in Pearl City, Hawai‘i, for anti-
WNV antibodies by a blocking enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
targeting an immunodominant WNV epi-
tope on the NS1 protein. Prior to estab-
lishing the ELISA as part of the WNV
testing algorithm at the HDHL in Febru-
ary 2005, optimal titers for both antigen
and antibody were determined by check-
erboard titration. Sera were tested in
triplicate at a 1:20 dilution for initial
screening, with suspected positives (inhi-
bition $50%) also tested at further
dilutions (e.g., 1:40 and 1:80). Beginning
in February 2005, a blocking ELISA
protocol was established according to
Hall et al. (1995), using inactivated
Kunjin lysate antigen and WNV-
specific monoclonal antibodies, with mod-
ifications for detection of anti-WNV anti-
bodies as described in Jozan et al. (2003).
All ELISA positives were considered
presumptive until confirmatory testing by
plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT).

Samples were shipped overnight on ice
to Colorado State University, Fort Collins,
Colorado, where they were screened for
anti-JEV antibodies by PRNT (Beaty et
al., 1995). For PRNT, sera were tested at a
1:10 dilution in BA-1 medium (Hank’s M-
199 salts, 1% bovine serum albumin,
350 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/
ml penicillin, 100 mg/l streptomycin, 1 mg/

l Fungizone in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.6)
against a challenge dose of approximately
100 plaque-forming units of JEV strain
826309 (isolated from human brain in
India). Serum samples that neutralized
#70% of JEV were considered negative
for anti-JEV antibodies. Samples with
.70% neutralization of JEV were retested
through a second JEV PRNT for confir-
mation of the initial result, and were also
screened by PRNT at a 1:10 dilution for
antibodies to WNV (using strain NY99-
4132, isolated from crow brain in New
York, USA) and SLEV (using strain TBH-
28, isolated from human brain in Florida,
USA) with the same criteria of .70%
neutralization for a positive result. This
70% neutralization cut-off was selected to
reasonably distinguish antiflavivirus anti-
body reactivity from clearly seronegative
(i.e., ,50% neutralization) samples.

A total of 1,835 birds of 11 species were
sampled, most of which were nonnative
residents of Hawai‘i (Table 1). Serum
samples from all birds included in the
present study were negative for anti-WNV
antibodies as determined by blocking
ELISA, along with an additional .10,000
avian serum samples collected in Hawai‘i
from January 2006–October 2009. Sera
from three birds (0.16%) exhibited flavi-
virus neutralizing activity with between
71–94% neutralization of JEV or SLEV.
Sera from these three birds were clearly
negative for antibodies to WNV by ELISA
(,0% inhibition) and by PRNT (,50%
neutralization). Sera with JEV- or SLEV-
neutralizing activity were collected be-
tween June and September 2005 from a
Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis) and
a Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora) at the
Honolulu International Airport and a
Spotted Dove at Dillingham Airfield. In
two of these birds (Spotted Dove and Java
Sparrow), apparent cross-reactive antifla-
vivirus antibodies made it difficult to
differentiate antibodies specific to JEV
versus SLEV (Table 2).

Japanese encephalitis virus has been
deemed the most important cause of

epidemic encephalitis worldwide and is
the leading recognized cause of childhood
encephalitis in Asia (Tsai, 1997; Solomon,
2003). Likewise, WNV is an important
cause of arboviral disease in the United
States and, since its arrival to New York in
1999, has led to neuro-invasive disease in
.11,000 humans and the death of likely
millions of birds (Reimann et al., 2008).
Because transmission of these viruses
involves primarily wild birds and mosqui-
toes, as well as pigs for JEV, they are
difficult to control and eradicate once
established. Therefore, ongoing monitor-
ing for these viruses is important, espe-
cially in Hawai‘i, where the climate favors
year-round arbovirus transmission and,
presumably, competent (and naı̈ve) vec-
tors and hosts are in abundance.

Hawai‘i has been recognized as a
potential location for JEV emergence that

could facilitate spread from Asia to
western North America (Quisenberry and
Wallace, 1959). The possibility of intro-
duction of SLEV, WNV, JEV, or other
zoonotic viruses to Hawai‘i via viremic
captive birds or infected mosquitoes is an
important consideration in quarantine and
other control measures. Accordingly,
WNV surveillance has been ongoing in
Hawai‘i since November 2004, and em-
bargoes and quarantines have been im-
plemented to mitigate the threat of WNV
introduction (Marra et al., 2004). Quanti-
tative analysis suggested that the most
likely source for the introduction of WNV
to Hawai‘i is a human-transported infected
mosquito, or an infectious bird or other
vertebrate host (Kilpatrick et al., 2004).
Similarly, JEV introduction to the West
coast of the United States was deemed
most likely to occur via an infected

mosquito arriving by air or marine trans-
port, via a viremic bird by importation or
migration, or via a viremic human traveler;
the latter two could serve as a source of
infection for blood-feeding mosquitoes
(Nett et al., 2008).

While local transmission could initiate
following JEV or WNV introduction to
Hawai‘i, maintenance or amplification of
transmission could subsequently fail due
to lack of immediate and sufficient num-
bers of competent vectors or hosts.
Alternately, flaviviruses that are yet to be
detected or identified could occasionally
infect birds. For example, ‘‘insect-only’’
flaviviruses have recently been identified
in Africa, Asia, and the Americas (re-
viewed recently in Cook et al., 2009) and
could be immunogenic in some birds.
Documented viruses such as Murray
Valley encephalitis virus, also a member
of the JEV serocomplex that circulates
between mosquito vectors and avian hosts
in Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Irian
Java, may also be capable of unexpected
spread (Coelen and Mackenzie, 1988).
The lack of 100% virus neutralization by
sera from flavivirus-positive birds in the
present study may suggest a primary
infecting virus other than WNV, SLEV,
or JEV. We detected a minimal percent-
age (,0.2%) of birds with flavivirus-
neutralizing antibodies in Hawai‘i from
2004–2005. Low prevalence of antibodies
to arboviruses among birds in Hawai‘i, as
well as difficulty distinguishing the infec-
tive virus, is consistent with previously
reported data. In 1959, surveillance for
JEV, SLEV, and Eastern and Western
equine encephalitis viruses on Oahu
revealed five birds (0.66%; n5754), all
residents, with evidence of nonspecific
virus neutralization (Wallace et al., 1964).
In contrast, WNV antibody prevalence
among some avian species has been 10–
25% in the southern mainland United
States, several years or more after the
introduction of WNV (e.g., Louisiana in
2002 [Komar et al., 2005], Georgia in 2004
[Gibbs et al., 2006]).

Native Hawaiian birds are potentially
vulnerable to disease associated with
infection with novel arboviruses (Warner,
1968; Van Riper et al., 1986; LaPointe et
al., 2009). However, introduced birds
thrive on the Islands, and many of these
are likely competent reservoir hosts of
WNV and SLEV, such as the House
Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and House
Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), as well as
the native Hawai‘i ‘Amakihi (Hemignathus
virens; McLean et al., 1983; Reisen et al.,
2001; Komar et al., 2003; LaPointe et al.,
2009). Potential JEV reservoirs are also
present in Hawai‘i, such as the resident
Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax
nycticorax hoactli) and introduced Cattle
Egret (Bubulcus ibis), as well as feral
swine (Sus scrofa) (Buescher et al., 1959;
Mayer and Brisbin, 1991; Mackenzie et
al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004; LaPointe,
2007). In addition, potentially competent
mosquito vectors are found in Hawai‘i
including Aedes albopictus, Ochlerotatus
japonicus, and Culex quinquefasciatus
(Reeves and Hammon, 1946; Quisenberry
and Wallace, 1959; Joyce, 1961; Larish
and Savage, 2005; LaPointe, 2007; La-
Pointe et al., 2009). Further, Cx. annulir-
ostris and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus have
been intercepted on numerous occasions
from aircraft arriving in Honolulu (Joyce,
1961). Finally, unlike some birds in the
mainland United States in which cross-
protective anti-WNV antibodies may in-
hibit JEV amplification in blood (Nemeth
et al., 2009), Hawaiian birds are likely
immunologically naive and, therefore,
more susceptible to adverse effects of
flavivirus infection. The effects of JEV
infection in birds remain unknown.

Recent flavivirus dispersal includes
WNV spread from the Middle East to
the United States and JEV from Southeast
Asia to Australia. While the mechanism of
spread remains unknown, these invasions
signify the perpetual threat of pathogen
emergence. In addition to global travel,
human movement into previously unin-
habited areas and associated changes in

land and water use may facilitate pathogen
emergence and establishment (Mackenzie
et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004). While the
geographic spread of highly pathogenic
Asian H5N1 avian influenza virus is
closely monitored on a global scale, JEV
and other arboviruses merit worldwide
attention as significant zoonotic patho-
gens. The possibility of rapid and wide-
ranging pathogen spread is greater than
ever, and surveillance for novel invasions,
especially involving wildlife, may provide
an early warning and lead to mitigation of
epidemic threats.

Abstract

A regional survey was conducted in Nepal for antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in

domestic animals. Sera from pigs, and limited numbers of ducks and horses were collected from 16

districts in 2002–2003 and subjected to three serological tests. Of 270 porcine sera tested by C-

ELISA, 55% were found positive for the presence of antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus.

Additional testing for IgM antibody to JEV revealed less than 2% of C-ELISA positive sera had

evidence of recent JEV infection. Plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT) using JEV, Murray

Valley encephalitis (MVEV) and Kunjin (KUNV) viruses implicated JEV as the flavivirus

associated with the observed antibody response in most sero-positive pigs. However, eight porcine

sera with predominant neutralising antibody for KUNV (an Australasian subtype of West Nile Virus)

provided evidence for the circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal.

1. Introduction

Japanese encephalitis is an emerging disease of animals and humans, spread by

mosquitoes to a range of susceptible wild and domestic vertebrate hosts [1]. Endemic

cycling of the causative Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from mosquitoes to ardeid

water birds creates a reservoir for spill-over to other species in times of peak transmission,

generally associated with warm month high vector prevalence. At such times, infection of

pigs in the vicinity of human habitation correlates with the occurrence of human disease.

High viraemic levels in pigs promote infection of mosquito species that can readily

transmit the virus to humans [2]. In the southern lowlands of Nepal, irrigated rice fields

provide ample mosquito breeding sites in proximity with humans and domestic animals,

ensuring favourable conditions for human JEV infection [3].

Japanese encephalitis has been recognised in Nepal since 1978 [4] and has progressed

to be now the major cause of seasonal meningo-encephalitic related morbidity and

mortality [5,6]. Since 1987 annual outbreaks of human JEV disease, peaking in

September, have been reported causing up to 2000–3000 cases and 200–400 deaths per

year. More than half the cases and deaths were reported from two districts Kailali and

Banke. In the large 1997 outbreak, three western districts Banke, Bardia and Kailali

encompassed more than 80% of the 2403 reported cases and in 335 deaths [6]. The virus

now occurs in 27 districts of the country, including the Kathmandu valley and an estimated

12 million people are at risk.

Although JEV is a recognised cause of disease in pigs and horses, most infections of

domestic animals in JEV endemic areas are asymptomatic and human disease imperatives

are predominant [2]. In 2001, the Nepal Department of Livestock Services implemented

control measure, which recognised the significant role of pigs for human JEV infection by

vaccination of 45,213 pigs in held in tarai (lowland border district) zones with live

attenuated virus [7]. Approximately, 40% of the Nepal pig population (about 359,000

pigs) is held in these lowland JEV endemic districts. While pigs are critically involved in

epizootics of JEV, there have been only limited studies in Nepal, which might assist

targeting vaccination programs [3,8]. The lack of diagnostic facilities for JEV at the



G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175168
Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Kathmandu was addressed in a collaborative and

training project with the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong. In the

year 2002–2003, the CVL launched a program to monitor for evidence of JEV infection

with this virus in domestic animals. This paper presents an assessment of the laboratory

testing undertaken on sera collected from that survey.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Viruses

Viruses and antigens used in serologic assays were originated from the following

sources: JEV Nakayama strain derived from a 1956 stock held at AAHL; MVEV MRM66

and KUNV MRM16 isolates were both obtained from Public Health Virology,

Queensland Health Scientific Services, Australia.
2.2. Sera

A total of 270 sera were collected in 2002–2003 from pigs, ducks and horses by visiting

various livestock farms of 16 different district (see Fig 1) tarai regions, where high

incidence of human infection has previously been recorded [5]. These sera were stored at

K20 8C until testing. Testing of sera was conducted at the AAHL and CVL institutes.
Fig. 1. Map of Nepal showing districts in which animals were sampled for serology.



G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 169
From 270 collected sera, 200 (pig sera only) were heat treated for 30 min at 56 8C before
shipment to Australia for testing. On arrival sera were treated by gamma irradiation for

50 kGy to ensure inactivation of potentially exotic agents. The remaining 70 pigs ducks

and horse sera were tested at CVL after the establishment of JEV serology capability.

2.3. JEV C-ELISA serology

The competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) for detection of antibody to JEV has previously

been described [9]. In brief, (a) polyvinyl 96-well plates were coated with JEV antigen, (b)

serum was added at 1/10 dilution, (c) monoclonal antibody JEV-995 [10] was added to the

serum in ELISA plates, (d) enzyme-antibody conjugate was anti-mouse/horse radish

peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA), and (e)

tetramethyl benzidine (TMB)–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS (pH 7.2)—

0.05% Tween-20 wash steps separated steps (a)–(e). Substrate conversion was stopped by

addition of sulphuric acid (1 M), and the plates immediately read in a microplate

photometer (Labsystems, Finland) at wavelength 450 nm. Resultant optical densities (OD)

were converted to percent inhibition relative to a normal pig serum control.

2.4. JEV IgM ELISA serology

The IgM ELISA was a standard antibody capture format modified from other studies

[11,12]. In brief, (a) ELISA plates were coated with an anti-swine IgM (KPL, Gaithersburg,

MD, USA), and (b) sera were tested at 1/300 dilution in PBS (pH 7.2), 0.05% Tween-20, 1%

skim milk, (c) inactivated JEV antigen, PEG concentrated from infected culture supernatant

medium was applied at an optimal dilution (1/200), (d) JEV-989 antibody labelled with

fluorescein (used as a hapten, not fluorophor) was bound to trapped antigen. (e) Enzyme-

antibody conjugate was anti-fluorescein/horse radish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories Ltd,

Peterborough, UK) and (f) TMB–H2O2 comprised the detection system. PBS-tween wash

steps separated steps (a)–(f). Substrate and plate reading were as for the C-ELISA, while OD

values were converted to percent positive control.

2.5. Plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) serology

PRNT serology was used to test for specific neutralising antibody against JEV. Two

related flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses (MVEV and KUNV,

respectively), were included together with JEV for all PRNTs. Sera were tested in a PRNT

according to standard methodology [13] using 24-well plates. In brief, sera were tested in

serial dilution fourfold from 1/40 to 1/1280. Serum dilutions were mixed with an equal

volume containing approximately 50 plaque forming units of virus and incubated for

90 min. Two-hundred microliters of the mixture was transferred to 24-well plates with

confluent Vero cell monolayers. After 90 min a carboxy-methyl cellulose overlay medium

was added. After 4–5 days plates were fixed and stained with formol saline—0.1%

methylene blue then counted for plaques. The 50% plaque reduction end-point titres were

estimated by linear interpolation between dilutions (log value) and plaque counts to give a

continuous scale of results over the dilution series. Some sera with PRNT titres of less than



G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175170
40 were retested in a screening test using sera at a 1/10 dilution only. Results were reported

as ‘!10’ or ‘10–40’. Sera were generally tested only once unless anomalies were evident
on analysis. Internal quality control monitored input virus, positive and negative control

sera to ensure inter-assay consistency.
3. Results

3.1. JEV C-ELISA serology

Fig. 1 shows areas of Nepal where we obtained the test samples, which were

predominantly from pigs. Initial testing of serum samples was carried out by JEV

C-ELISA. Antibodies against JEV were detected in 154 of 251 pigs (61%) using the JEV

C-ELISA (Table 1). In all districts, there was evidence for infection of animals with JEV.

Correlation of results with the geographical origin of the sera from within Nepal

demonstrated that highest proportion of antibody positive animals were located in the Far-

Western region (89% JEV antibody positive) with the lowest rates in the Central region

(39% JEV antibody positive). Additional JEV C-ELISA serology in four horses and 11

ducks showed 50 and 7% sero-positive animals, respectively.

3.2. JEV IgM serology

IgM ELISA was performed on 119 C-ELISA positive sera to measure the frequency of

recent exposure to JEV. Only two sera (or 1.7%) were positive for IgM antibody to JEV.

These sera originated from pigs, respectively, located in Makwanpur (collected in

November) and Siraha (collected in May) districts.

3.3. PRNT serology

PRNT serology was conducted to further assess the significance of the JEV C-ELISA

results. Of the 200 pig sera sent to AAHL, almost all were tested by JEV C-ELISA and

PRNT for antibody to JEV and related flaviviruses MVEV and KUNV. Ranking by titre,

independently for each of the three viruses (Table 2) gave distribution profiles for the

tested population. The profile showed greater numbers of sera having the highest antibody

levels against JEV as might be expected in an area endemic for this virus.

Antibody detected in an animal as a heterotypic response to related viruses will, in the

absence of those viruses, generally be evident as a lesser titre to that against the

homologous virus. For each PRNT positive serum, calculation of titre ratios (JEV:MVEV

and JEV:KUNV) confirmed that JEV PRNT titres were on average five times the level of

MVEV PRNT titres and 10 times the KUNV titre values, consistent with a specific JEV

antibody response relative to the two related flaviviruses.

JEV-C-ELISA and PRNT results were compared in 2!2 pair-wise tables for
agreement (Table 3). PRNT results were scored as positive or negative using either JEV

PRNT results only, or more broadly using combined JEV/MVEV/KUNV PRNT results. In

the latter grouping, a positive in any of the three PRNTs was scored as positive for the

purpose of comparison with the JEV C-ELISA. The overall results were similar for the two

groupings with about 60–70% agreement between the assay results, and the discrepancies

evenly split between the two available options.

One effect of broadening the scope for comparison of C-ELISA and PRNT to include

MVEV and KUNV was the identification of nine sera, negative by JEV ELISA and JEV

PRNT, but positive for antibody against either, or both of the other flaviviruses. These

results are detailed as they may provide some insight into additional flaviviruses that

circulate in Nepal (Table 4). Also included are results, which, although detected as JEV

C-ELISA positive, evidenced greater PRNT titres against either MVEV and/or KUNV,

than JEV. From the groups of sera with higher PRNT titre levels (O40), there were two
sera for which antibody titres against MVEV were at least four times the corresponding

JEV titres, and four sera for which antibody titres against KUNV were four times or

definitively with either MVEV or KUNV. Some clustering of sera by district of origin

relative to these non-JEV reaction patterns was also noted. In particular, sera collected

from the Kapil Bastu district were the majority of the sera positive for antibody to KUNV

at a higher level than for JEV.
4. Discussion

Previous published studies of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal have addressed issues of

diagnosis and emerging prevalence in human populations [5,6] and though the

involvement of domestic animals, in particular pigs [3,8], has been recognised as a risk



G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175 173
factor, there has been no broad surveillance to determine the prevalence of infection in

pigs or other susceptible animals. The lowland provinces of Nepal have proven a

favourable environment for JEV to become established and emerge as a cause of

significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Effective control measures must be

founded on sound epidemiological investigation. The extent and involvement of pigs and

possibly other animals as risk factors for mosquito transmission of the virus to humans is

an essential component.

This study presents results, which provide evidence that antibody to JEV is in pigs

widespread across 16 districts. Though sample numbers are relatively low, the mean

seroprevalence of greater than 90% in the Far Western region (Table 1) is evidence for

intense circulation of JEV in these animals. It is significant that the highest rates of human

JEV disease has been described in the western districts [14], therein correlating with our

results of high proportions of JEV antibody positive pigs in these districts. Circulation of

JEV is affected by animal management practices and the co-location of pigs and human

dwellings is an obvious risk factor for human disease. In Nepal, pigs are generally animals

that will be sold for meat after relatively short periods (1–2 years). Annual farrowing,

together with removal of immune animals, ensures non-immune pigs will exist each year,

heightening the risk for human disease.

The absence of IgM antibody to JEV amongst the tested animals is not surprising,

when the following factors are taken into account. None of the samples were

collected in the months of August/September, when peak transmission of the virus in

pigs might be expected, based on human epidemiological patterns of JEV.

Furthermore, the duration of detectable IgM in pigs is relatively short [11], averaging

only 3 weeks and would not be expected to persist in those months in which samples

were collected.

A wide range of animal species may be infected and develop antibodies to JEV. It

might, therefore, be expected that sera collected from horses and ducks in an endemic

region could be seropositive. This was the case for two of four horse sera collected in Parsa

district and one duck serum from Banke district (Table 1). These species are not significant

in the maintenance cycle of JEV, but this is the first report for involvement of equines in

Nepal.

In regions in which multiple flaviviruses might potentially cause infections, the

determination of a specific flavivirus antibody response can be problematic as the potential

influence of related flaviviruses on serological investigations for these viruses is well

recognised [15]. In applying a range of serology approaches in this study, we were

attempting to evaluate the specificity of the detected immune response against JEV and

investigate the likelihood of any recent infection. The JEV C-ELISA has been shown to

detect antibody against related flaviviruses (Table 3 and [9]), and while the PRNT is a

more specific test, field animals subjected to multiple exposures with a range of

flaviviruses have a broadened neutralising antibody response. The titre magnitude and the

relative differential of serum titres against different viruses have been used to evaluate the

significance of results. For this reason, we included two related flaviviruses MVEV and

KUNV) as well as JEV in our PRNT testing for neutralising antibody. On the basis of

predominant titre levels, there is good evidence that detected antibody generally

represented exposure to JEV (Table 2).



G.R. Pant et al. / Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 29 (2006) 166–175174
The interpretation of the serology results must also allow for the possible influence of

JEV vaccination as a contributing factor to positive antibody determinations. However,

moderating considerations relate to the timing of vaccination, the turnover of animal stock

and the neutralising titres observed in the test animals. While the history of vaccination for

the tested animals was not available, collection of sera occurred 1–2 years after the 2001

vaccination campaign. Also only a small proportion of pigs were vaccinated and it is

unlikely that vaccination would have produced the high neutralising titres frequently seen

in the group of JEV seropositive animals in this study.

There is little information on the range of flaviviruses that may circulate in Nepal,

though JEV and dengue virus are recognised in humans [3]. West Nile virus has been

demonstrated in India [16], while the tick-borne flavivirus Kyasanur Forest has also been

identified in that country [17]. There were results for some sera in our survey for which an

interpretation of JE exposure was not particularly appropriate. Sera were identified that

had predominant neutralising activity for either KUNV or MVEV, providing evidence for

the circulation of flaviviruses other than JEV. This is particularly the case for sera that

were positive for PRNT antibody to KUNV but negative by JEV C-ELISA, e.g. sera 78

and 90 (Table 4). KUNV is now recognised as an Australasian variant of WNV [18,19],

and in Nepal, predominant neutralising titres against KUNV is presumptive evidence for

WNV circulation [20]. We believe that there have not previously been reports for this virus

in Nepal, however, WNV has been isolated from pig sera in India [21]. Prior infection in

pigs with JEV may inhibit WNV viraemia [22], which may be a factor in our detection of

antibody to WNV only in districts with a relatively low prevalence of JEV.

While JEV is considerably more important as a human epizootic virosis than a

production animal disease agent, the significance of pigs in the amplification cycle

introduces an additional basis for involvement of veterinary authorities in monitoring for

this agent. Accurate laboratory based detection and diagnosis is a crucial platform from

which to extend control measures [20]. Collaborative work associated with this

publication has transferred the capability for JEV diagnosis to the Central Veterinary

laboratory in Nepal. Control of the disease will ultimately require effective human

vaccination as vaccination of pigs is not considered a useful control measure [23].

However, there is indeed a role for integration between veterinary and public health

authorities in determining the epidemiology of infection and prospective surveillance for

JEV. Our results indicating the likely circulation of West Nile virus in Nepal are also of

value in consideration of the aetiology human disease presenting as febrile or encephalitic

syndromes.

SUMMARY

Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga district of Karnataka state of
India. The causative agent, KFD virus (KFDV), is a highly pathogenic member in the family Flaviviridae, producing a
haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings. KFD is a zoonotic disease and has so far been localised only in a
southern part of India. The exact cause of its emergence in the mid 1950s is not known. A variant of KFDV, char-
acterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been recently identified in
Saudi Arabia. KFDV and AHFV share 89% sequence homology, suggesting common ancestral origin. Homology
modelling of KFDV envelope (E) protein exhibited a structure similar to those of other flaviviruses, suggesting a
common mechanism of virus-cell fusion. The possible mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction involved in infection
by KFDV may resemble that of other flavivirses. Present understanding is that KFDV may be persisting silently in
several regions of India and that antigenic and structural differences from other tick borne viruses may be related to
the unique host specificity and pathogenicity of KFDV. From January 1999 through January 2005, an increasing
number of KFD cases have been detected in Karnataka state of Indian subcontinent despite routine vaccination,
suggesting insufficient efficacy of the current vaccine protocol. However, the exact cause of the increase of KFD cases
needs further investigation. Considering the requirement of safer and more effective vaccines in general, there is
clearly a need for developing an alternative vaccine as well as a rapid diagnostic system for KFD. The changing
ecology of the prime focus of the KFD also warrants attention, as it may lead to establishment of the disease in newer
localities, never reported before. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
KFDV that causes a haemorrhagic disease in
infected human beings is a highly pathogenic
member of the family Flaviviridae. KFD was first
recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga dis-
trict of Karnataka state (then Mysore) of India in
1957 [1,2]. KFDV commonly infects the black faced
langur (Presbytis entellus) and red faced bonnet
monkey (Macaca radiate). KFDV is of zoonotic ori-
gin and gets transmitted by the bite of infective
ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera), especially at its
nymphal stage, and the ticks remain infectious
throughout their lives. KFDV also circulates in
small animals such as rodents, shrews and birds

[3]. Adult ticks mostly feed on large animals, as
they serve as a good host for tick proliferation,
however they do not suffer from the disease.
Neutralising antibodies have been found in cattle,
buffaloes, goats, wild bears, porcupines, squirrels,
rats, mice and a number of avian species (Table 1).
Direct transmission of the virus from rodents to
humans is possible; however, person-to-person
transmission has not been documented. Besides,
KFDV is regarded as a potential biowarfare agent
[19].
KFDV belongs to the Russian spring summer

encephalitis (RSSE) virus group and the antibodies
cross react with other RSSE group members.
Although isolated cases of KFD and RSSE have
been reported from several parts of India, epi-
demics of KFD mostly remain confined in the
southern Indian state of Karnataka. Epidemics of
KFD were controlled to a great extent using a
formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in chick
embryo fibroblasts [20]. Although KFDV is antige-
nically similar to the members in the complex

TBEV (tick born encephalitis virus) group, the
exact causes of the sudden emergence of KFDV
in India during the late 1950s and the subsequent
localisation to Karnataka state alone are not clear.
Despite its high pathogenicity and potential epide-
miological importance, there have been relatively
few detailed antigenic and molecular studies on
KFD virus. The only molecular information avail-
able is the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding
the vital structural proteins [21].
According to the internationally accepted bio-

safety rules, KFDV is a level-4 virus. KFDV is
a spherical, enveloped virus of 45 nm diameter.
It has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA

genome. The virus is lethal to infant and weaning
mice when inoculated through the intracerebral or
intraperitoneal route. It is cytopathic and produces
plaques in chick embryo, hamster kidney and
monkey kidney cell cultures, but replicates with-
out cytopathic effect in a continuous line
of Haemaphysalis spinigera tick cells [22]. The
early clinical signs of KFD in humans involve
sudden onset of fever and headache, followed by
back pain, severe pain in lower and upper extremi-
ties, prostration as well as biphasic course of
illness. Subsequently to fever, haemorrhagic mani-
festations, including intermittent epistaxis, haema-
temesis, melena and frank blood in the stools, are

with KFD is only 2–10%. In some cases, central
nervous system abnormalities develop after an
afebrile period of 1–2 weeks. A mild meningoence-
phalitis also occurs frequently amongst a small
portion of patients, developing coma or bronchop-
neumonia prior to death. IgE has also been impli-
cated as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD
and possibly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23].
The exact cause of haemorrhage is not known
although disseminated intravascular coagulation
is suspected. Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus and
KFDV are two important viruses under the family
Flaviviridae that are genetically closely related to
TBEV, but produce haemorrhagic fever instead of
encephalitis [3].

ECOLOGY
KFDV was first isolated from sick monkeys cap-
tured in Kyasanur forest of Shimoga district of
Karnataka state of India, hence the name. Shimoga
is located at 571 metres altitude, between 13�270

and 14�390 north longitude, and between 74�380

and 76�40 latitude. The Shimoga district of Karna-
taka state is full of closed forests and few open for-
ests (Figure 1). Shimoga has 276855 hectares of

forest land. Wild monkeys, Presbytis entellus (Black
faced langur) andMacaca radiate (Red faced bonnet
monkey), are very common in the forest localities
that commonly get infected by KFDV through
bites of infected ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera).
Other than Haemaphysalis spinigera, KFDV has
also been isolated from 16 different types of ticks
(Table 2). Unfed nymphs are highly anthropophi-
lic and transmit the disease to humans bites. Ticks
also transmit the virus transovarialy. Frequent
transmission of KFDV via active nymphs has
been reported during October to December
months. Fed female adult ticks lay a huge number
of eggs which hatch to larvae under the leaves in
the forests. The ticks drop from leaves on small
mammals and monkeys on which the larvae feed
and later mature to nymphs, and the cycle is
repeated (Figure 2). Bhat and his coworker [31]
conducted a classical experiment, by allowing
larvae of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides to feed on
KFDV infected viremic rodents and rearing the
KFDV infected larvae to the next generation. In
this study they found that the fed larvae, nymphs,
unfed adults, fed adult males and females after
oviposition were infected, while the unfed larvae
were free from infection. Nymphs and adults

transmitted the infection by biting on rodents and
rabbits, respectively, and this rodent-tick cycle
continues for more than one life-cycle. An infected
adult tick shows a titre of 3–5� 106 mouse LD50/

30 ml, and the virus can be detected for as long as
245 days after infection [31]. It has been shown that
the presence of KFDV specific neutralising antibo-
dies in fed blood has no effect on survival of KFDV
in the ticks [39].
In Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab area), the central focus

of the KFD was established in great part due to
deep encroachment of human colonisation on a
primitive sylvan territory. Originally, most of the
vegetation consisted of tall rain forest interspersed
with deciduous and semi-deciduous forest on the
slopes and on the ridges of rolling hills with mixed
bamboo and shrub jungle at the edges. The rainy
season lasts from June to September, but the rain-
fall varies greatly from one year to another, with a
mean of 85 inches per year. The humid and rela-
tively fertile bottoms between the terrain’s undula-
tions are adequate for the cultivation of paddy
fields. High humidity generated from the culti-
vated fields is suitable for maintenance of the ticks
throughout the year and availability of nearby for-
est sustains a large population of wild moneys.
Such ecological specificity is rarely seen in any
other parts of India. All these in combination
may be responsible for the geographical localisa-
tion of KFDV only to Karnataka state of India.
Local villagers staying in and around the forest
area frequently visit the forest for collection of fire
woods and get infected through tick bites. Generally
women mostly visit the forest for fire wood collec-
tion, whereas children do not. Men are in between.
So, women have the highest opportunity to get
infected whereas children have the lowest.
The ecology of Shimoga area of Karnataka state

is very special due to presence of divergent bio-
types of forests, cultivated areas and grasslands
in and around a common place. A local mechan-
ism of maintenance of KFDV in this area presup-
poses the presence of several elements. Presence
of adequate animal reservoir in this area, a large
population of carriers having consistent suscept-
ibility, the ability to circulate KFDV and the cap-
ability to infect an adequate number of vectors in
Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area are thought to be
important for sustenance of KFDV. A series of vec-
tors with proved affinity for the reservoir host and
capacity to become infected with KFDV acquired
from the host is a critical factor for persistence of
KFDV in Shimoga (Sagar-Sorab) area. Seasonal
fluctuations of phase density of ticks in these areas
are so timed that transmission of KFDV through

EPIDEMIOLOGY
In the Kyasanur Forest two species of wild mon-
keys, Presbytis entellus (Black faced langur) and
Macaca radiate (Red faced bonnet monkey), com-
monly succumb to the natural infection with
KFDV. Between October 1964 and September 1973,
1046 monkeys (860 P. entellus and 186 M. radiata)
died, and KFDV was isolated from 118 P. entellus
and 13 M. radiata. High mortality of monkeys was
generally observed from December to May which
coincided with the seasonal activity of immature
stages of Haemaphysalis ticks, the incriminated vec-
tors of KFDV. Epizootiology of KFD in wild moneys
of Shimoga, specifically the death of monkeys in dry
seasons (February and March) correlates well with
human cases of KFD [41]. Several studies have con-
firmed the susceptibility of Macaca radiata (bonnet
macaques) to KFD and demonstrated KFDV specific
gastrointestinal and lymphoid lesions [42]. The
epidemic period correlated well with the period
of greatest human activity in the forest, after the
monsoon (June-September) was over; i.e. November
to December for the paddy harvest and December
to May, the period to gather firewood and other for-
est products [43].

KFD epizootic is initially characterised by the
spread of the disease to the areas contiguous
with the original focus of infection. Since the first
record, the epidemics of KFD have occurred
repeatedly in Shimoga district of Karnataka and
in its adjoining areas. During the epizootic period
of 1964–1965, monkey deaths occurred only within
the previously known infected area. During 1965–
1966 the epizootic extended towards a contiguous
forest south-east of Sagar town involving an area
covering approximately 30 km2. The epizootics
which appeared within the original infected area
between October 1966 and September 1969 show-
ed a tendency to move north-west of Sorab town.
During the epizootic season of 1969–1970 and
1970–1971 monkey deaths occurred in Yakshi
and Gudavi forests located further north-west of
Sorab town. During 1971–1972, epizootics contin-
ued to occur in the old focus of Sagar and Sorab
taluk and occurred in a new focus at Gadgeri
and a nearby valley. By the end of year 1973, epi-
zootics and epidemics were recognised in several
new foci, distant from the original focus. The

new foci were Aramanekoppa in Hosanagar taluk
of Shimoga district and Kodani in Honnavar taluk
of North Kanara disctrict. It was also observed
in certain localities of original focus (Barur,
Jambai, Maisavi and Padavagodu) that the KFDV
activity persisted over several years [44]. During
1975 epizootics KFD spread to Mandagadde area
in Thirthahalli taluk, Shimoga district approxi-
mately 50 km south–west of the periphery of
Aramanekoppa focus. Later in during 1982 the dis-
ease appeared at Patrame area in Beltangady
taluk, South Kanara district, approximately 80 km
south of the periphery of Mandagadde focus [44].
Other than Karnataka state, the primary site of

introduction of KFDV, antibodies against KFDV
have also been detected in humans in several parts
of Kutch and Saurashtra of Gujrat state (semi-arid
area, around 1200 km away from main focus of
KFD) and isolated localities like Ramtek (near
Nagpur), Kingaon and Parbatpur of West Bengal
state of India [45]. A recent serological survey, con-
ducted among the human population of the
Andaman and Nicobar islands of India, reported
the highest prevalence of HI (hemagglutination
inhibition) antibodies against KFDV. Neutralising
antibodies to KFDV were detected in Middle
Andaman. Sex specific prevalence of neutralising
antibodies to KFDV was significantly higher in
males than in females in Andaman and Nicobar
islands of India [46]. Considering the above find-
ings, Andaman and Nicobar islands of India might
be a major silent focus of KFDV activity, but there
is no corroborative data from case reports of KFD.
A variant genotype of KFDV, characterised

serologically and genetically as Alkhurma hae-
morrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been identified
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [47]. AFHV was first
isolated in the 1990s from the blood of a butcher.
Since then a total of 24 cases were reported in
the last 10 years and most of these cases were
originated from Mecca or Jeddah of Saudi Arabia
[48]. More recently, 37 cases have been reported
through February 2001 to February 2003 from
Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Until 1999, not more than
three cases of AHF per year had been reported.
Recent increase of AHF cases in Saudi Arabia
may be due to better reporting and early identifi-
cation of the disease. The transmission of most of
the reported AHF cases was via wound, camel raw
milk, tick/mosquito bite or direct contact with the
infected animals. Although the sources of AHF

infection are very diverse, most of the cases were
localised in either Mecca or Jeddah. Any wide-
spread epidemic of AHF has not occurred in Saudi
Arabia perhaps due to scarce distribution of virus.
In contrast, India has experienced several KFD epi-
demics, although they have been very much con-
fined to Karnatak state. Epidemics of KFD were
controlled to a great extent after successful devel-
opment of a formalin-inactivated vaccine pro-
duced in chick embryo fibroblasts [20,49,50].
However, the recent data on the incidence of
KFD cases (unpublished) from five districts of Kar-
nataka state, namely Shimoga, Udupi, Mangalore,
Chickmangalore and Uttar Kannada suggest that
the number of cases has increased in the last five
years despite the routine vaccination (Figure 3).

CLINICAL, PATHOLOGICAL AND
HAEMATOLOGICAL FEATURES
Concurrently with the KFDV isolation and identi-
fication, there have been KFD outbreaks of
febrile and occasionally fatal illnesses among peo-
ple living in the vicinity of Shimoga district of Kar-
nataka. The incubation period before sudden
manifestation of the disease varies between 3–
8 days (Figure 4). After this initial stage a biphasic
course with mild meningoencephalitis and fever
developing after an afebrile period of 1–2 weeks
is common. Relative bradycardia is frequently
seen along with inflammation of the conjuctiva.
A small proportion of patients develop coma or
bronchopneumonia prior to death. The acute

phase of illness lasts for �2 weeks (Figure 4).
The case fatality in KFD is 2–10% [1], significantly
lower than in Alkhurma virus infection where case
fatality has been reported to be 25% [51]. Conva-
lescence in KFD survivors is generally pro-
longed—up to 4 weeks (Figure 4). Viremia in
KFD patients lasts for 12–13 days of illness and
unlike most other arboviruses (Figure 4), KFDV
is easily isolated from human sera. The level of virus
in blood circulation is considerably high (3.1� 106),
especially during the period of 3–6 days after the
onset of illness [52]. Leukopenia is a constant
feature in KFD patients and was due to a reduction
in both neutrophils and lymphocytes. In most
cases neutrophil count drops below 2000 cells/ml.

Lymphopenia was usually observed within the first
week of illness and significant eosinopenia during
the first or early in the second week. In several pati-
ents lymphocytosis was also observed between the
third and the fifth week [23]. Chatterjee et al. [53]
considered that prominent thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia in KFD are probably mediated through
antibodies to platelets and leukocytes. They postu-
lated that the KFD infection had directly or indir-
ectly altered the antigenicity of these cells,
triggering the production of antibodies to platelets
and leukocytes. However, no experimental evidence
is available in support of this postulation.

Pathologic manifestations of KFD in human
patients include parenchymal degeneration of the
liver and kidney, haemorrhagic pneumonitis, and a
moderate to marked prominence of the reticulo-
endothelial elements in the liver and spleen, with
marked erythrophagocytosis [54]. Pathologic and
haematologic investigations emphasised similarities
between KFD and Omsk haemorrhagic fever. Later
there was a shift in clinical emphasis from haemor-
rhagic to neurologic complications [55,56]. During
KFDV infection, interferonemia is concomitant with
the viremic phase. IgE has also been implicated as a
cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possi-
bly of other haemorrhagic fevers [23]. Neutralisation
studies indicated that the endogenous (circulating)
interferon (IFN) was antigenically similar to acid
stable form of IFN-alpha. Sathe et al. [57] monitored
endogenous IFN levels in acute (51) and convales-
cent phase (19) sera collected from KFD patients
and reported that the levels of circulating IFN in
the acute samples (GM 216.3þ/� 8.7) collected
between 4–7 post onset day (POD) were significantly
higher (p less than 0.001) than the convalescent
samples (GM 13.19þ/� 1.6) collected between
30–90 POD. Clinical or postmortem biopsies of
various organs suggested that KFD could pass
through four stages each lasting for about a
week; i.e. a prodromal stage with fever, hypotension
and hepatomegaly, a stage of complication charac-
terised by haemorrhage, neurological manifestation
or bronchopneumonia, a stage of recovery followed
by a stage of fever in some cases. Adhikary
Prabha and the coworkers [58] clinically studied
100 cases of KFD and conducted biopsies of
various organs. They interpreted that hypotension
in KFD could be of myocardial origin, whereas
encephalopathy could be due to a metabolic cause
probably of hepatic origin and lung signs due to

intra-alveolar haemorrhage and secondary infections
[58].
Clinical manifestations caused by Alkhurma

virus (ALKV), a variant/strain of KFDV include
fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, gen-
eralized muscle pain, anorexia and vomiting asso-
ciated with leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and ele-
vated levels of liver enzymes, alanine transferase
and aspartate transferase [48]. Like KFDV, ALKV
also produces encephalitic features such as confu-
sion, disorientation, drowsiness, coma, neck stiff-
ness, hemiparesis, paraparesis or convulsion and
haemorrhagic manifestations such as ecchymosis,
pupura, petechie, gastrointestinal bleeding, epis-
taxia, bleeding from puncture sites or menorrhagia
[51]. Like other haemmorhagic fever viruses, both
KFDV and ALKV are zoonotic [59]. Unlike
other haemorrhagic fever viruses classified
under the Arenaviridae (Lassa and Junin viruses),
Bunyabviridae (Hantaviruses), Filoviridae (Marburg
and Ebola viruses), KFDV and ALKV classified
under the Flaviviridae are vector-borne with less
intensity of haemorrhagic manifestations than the
others. Unlike KFDV, ALKV is transmitted to
humans by mosquito bites or direct contact with
the infected sheep or goats and ticks do not seem
to be important in the transmission [51]. Although
ALKV and KFDV are somewhat similar in clinical
presentations, high mortality (25%) reported for
ALKV infection is surprising. However, this may
be due to limited numbers of actually reported
cases. As more cases get reported, the high mortal-
ity indexes may drop for ALKV infections.

MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY
KFDV shares the highest sequence homology with
ALKV, a Saudi Arabian flavivirus. They share
many common features, i.e. TB-flavivirus specific
pentapeptide DSGHD at position 320–324, the
fusion peptide, AKG motif at position 2–4 of the
capsid protein, an extra amino acid residue
arginine at position 93 of the capsid protein,
EHLPKA hexapeptide at position 207–212 and
EGSK motif at position 308–311 of the envelope
protein, amino acid substitution at position 76
and 489 of the envelope protein [47]. Phylogenetic
analysis suggests that both of the viruses might
have evolved more than 1000 years ago (Figure 5),
originated in African subcontinent and might have
a common ancestor [60]. According to the current
genetic criteria of classification, KFDV and ALKV

Kyasanur forest diseaseKyasanur forest disease 157157

constitute two genetic subtypes of the same virus
species [47]. The exact nature of spread of KFDV
and its origin are not certain. One school of thought
is that the virus might have got introduced to India
via migrant birds. If so, why KFDV thereafter
stopped being introduced into India by migrant
birds or was not carried to other parts of India
remains a question. Sudden appearance of KFDV
in 1957 might be due to the first introduction by
migrant birds. The virus did not spread to other
parts of the country and got adapted to the regional
environmental/ecological conditions. Another pos-
sibility is that KFDV might have been introduced
to India a long time ago through the slave trade
and silently perpetuated in the subcontinent, result-
ing in an epidemic only in the year 1957, when it
was first identified and reported. In any event, the
possibility remains that KFD was present before
1957 without being recognised or reported. Gould
et al. [60] clearly stated in their classical review on
evolution and dispersal of encephalitis viruses that
KFDV appeared to be geographically isolated from
other members of the mammalian tick-borne virus
groups and that the discovery of AHFV in Saudi
Arabia in 1995 [61] now provided a rational explana-
tion for the presence of KFDV in the Indian forest.
KFDV and AHFV produce a similar haemorrhagic
disease and share strong genetic similarity. It was

estimated that the two viruses might have diverged
500–600 years ago [60]. In contrast, a recent report by
Charrel et al. [48] states that the ancestral lineage of
KFDV and AHFVmight have diverged 66–177 years
ago and that AHFV strains have a 4- to 72-year per-
iod of evolution. Studies on the population dyna-
mics of several flaviviruses indicated that Powassan
virus might have originated 275–393 years ago and
divergence between tick borne encephalitis virus
(TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) might have
occurred 291–411 years ago [48].
Gould et al. [60] argue that KFDV and other hae-

morrhagic and encephalitic tick-borne viruses
almost certainly exist in other parts of India and
in those countries that connect Saudi Arabia with
India, but their presence has not yet been recog-
nised nor demonstrated. To support their idea
they further state that phylogenetic analysis of
Karshi virus isolates from Uzbekistan and Rift val-
ley fever virus isolates from Afganistan suggest
them to be close relatives of KFDV and that all of
them are transmitted by ticks. KFDV stands out
from the western subtype, fareastern subtype
and Siberian subtype of flaviviruses in the phylo-
genetic analysis. The analysis suggests that possi-
bly the tick borne flaviviruses evolved gradually,
whereas mosquito borne viruses evolved more
rapidly to become more divergent in the course
of evolution [62]. Langat virus, which was found
in southern Asia, also closely relates to Middle
Eastern and Asian haemorrhagic fever viruses.
Another haemorrhagic fever virus named Omsk
haemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) found in Siberia
primarily resembles KFDV and AHFV. From sev-
eral studies, it appears that OHFV has circulated
harmlessly among indigenous small mammals
[63,64]. Initial thought was that occurrence of
OHFV was geographically placed, but later it
was confirmed that the virus had been introduced
to Siberia through muskrats and other species
from North America in the 1930s [63]. The phylo-
gentic relatedness of most of the haemorrhagic
fever causing flaviviruses suggests that all of
them belong to old world viruses [60].
Amino acid sequence of the envelope glycopro-

tein of KFDV was found to share 80% sequence
homology with that of TBEV. KFDV shares 38–
40% sequence homology with dengue virus, Japa-
nese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever
viruses with positionally conserved cysteines.
Genetic recombination among RNA viruses is

known to occur [65,66]. Sequence analyses of
KFDV indicate only divergent mutational changes,
suggesting origination by mutation, rather than by
recombination. The partial complementary DNA
sequence of the NS5 region of KFDV, which acts
as RNA dependant RNA polymerase, shares 99%
sequence similarity with that of Alkhurma virus,
followed by a homology of 94% with TBEV; 93%
with OHF, Langat, RSSE, Negishi viruses; 88%
with Meaban virus; 87% with Kadam, Saumarez
Reef, Tyuleniy viruses; 81% with Koutango and
Alfuy viruses; 80% with Japanese encephalitis,
West Nile, Apoi viruses and 76–78% with dengue
and other related viruses. The complete coding
sequence of the prototype strain of Alkhurma
virus, which shares the highest homology with
KFDV, is known. Genetic analysis of several
human strains of Alkhurma virus showed a very
low diversity [48]. Sequencing of 5 strains of
KFDV showed minimal genetic divergence but
all the strains had been isolated within a short
time period, i.e. 1956–1958 (R. Charrel, Université
de la Méditerranée, Marseille, France, personal
communication). Lack of complete sequence data
of KFDV isolates spanning a longer time period
limits its divergence analysis.

ANTIGENIC STRUCTURE
There have been relatively few detailed antigenic
or molecular studies on KFDV. The nucleotide
sequences of the genes encoding the viral structur-
al proteins and the deduced aminoacid sequences
indicated that KFDV is a distinct member in the
tick-borne flavivirus complex with the envelope
(E) protein containing the unique protease clea-
vage sites, fusion peptide, signal sequences and

hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The virus
belongs to the TBEV antigenic complex. Thus
far, no antigenic difference has been found among
KFDV strains. Among the structural proteins,
the E protein showed maximum similarity (77.4–
81.3%) to those of tick-borne flaviviruses. Align-
ment of the amino acid sequence with those of
other known tick-borne flavivirus sequences
revealed many conserved regions confirming
its identity as a member of the TBEV group. Com-
parison of the E protein amino acid sequences
between TBEV and KFDV indicates a high degree
of conservation of cysteine residues and the three
potential N-glycosylation sites. Venugopal et al.
[21] indicated that KFDV E protein has a threonine
to lysine substitution at 211aa position in the tick
specific genetic marker EHLPTA, and that another
genetic marker AQE at amino acid positions 232 to
234 is unique for KFDV.
Homology modelling of the E protein of KFDV

using the TBEV and Dengue-2 virus E proteins
as the structural templates (Figure 6) revealed
sequence and structure homologies of the fuso-
genic motif (aa98–111 aa) between KFDV and
TBEV, suggesting a common mechanism of envel-
ope fusion for these two viruses. Comparison of
the fusion sequence with Dengue and other mos-
quito borne flavivirus sequences indicated histi-
dine to glycine substitution at 104 aa position.
Like other flaviviruses, envelope protein of
KFDV also have three domains namely domain I,
II and III (Figure 6). Domain I is regarded as the
core to organise the whole structure. Domain II
is a linearly discontinuous domain which has
four disulphide bridges and bears the fusogenic
motis at its tip. Domain III is thought to be

involved in the receptor-ligand interaction.
Homology modelling of domain III revealed a
high structural homology between KFDV and
TBEV, suggesting a similar mechanism of recep-
tor-ligand interaction for these two viruses [67].
However, Gresikova and Sekeyova [68] reported
that monoclonal antibodies to TBEV exhibited
very poor haemagglutination-inhibition (HI)
with KFDV. Further, Tsekhanovskaya et al., by
performing epitope analysis using monoclonal
antibodies to the E protein of TBEV (Sofjin strain),
reported that KFDV and TBEV differ from
each other in the epitope mapping pattern [69].
They reported that there are more epitope-
exchanges between TBEV and KFDV than between
different TBEV strains. They hypothesised that
except the flavi group specific epitopes, fine anti-
genic map of KFDV may be different from that
of TBEV.
Although an amino acid sequence of the struc-

tural proteins (envelope protein) of KFDV is very
much similar to those of TBEV, the exact cause of
different host specificity of KFDV is not under-
stood. Based on the sequence homology, we
located amino acid residues of KFDV on the crys-
tal structure of envelope protein of TBEV. The
majority of amino acid changes in KFDV in com-
parison to TBEV were found to be residing on
the molecular surface and exposed. In KFDV, the
majority of the critical amino acid substitution
have occurred in the domain III. Comparative eva-
luation of amino acid sequences of domain III, the
putative receptor binding domain of the E protein
of KFDV and TBEV indicated a high degree of
similarity with 19 amino acid changes in complete
domain. Out of 19 amino acid changes only six
positions had non-conservative replacements and
the majority of them were conservative replace-
ments, which maintained the structural integrity
of Domain III. In Dengue virus, domain III has
been implicated, though no direct evidence is
available, for its interaction with heparin sulphate
on the mammalian cell surface [70,71]. Its possible
interaction with heparin sulphate may facilitate
attachment of the virus and trigger internalisation.
The domain III of KFDV shares a similar structural
pattern with dengue virus domain III crystal struc-
ture. In KFDV, the total architecture of modelled
structure of domain III, including �-sheets and
location of critical amino acids that are thought
to be involved in receptor-ligand interaction, is

similar, if not same, to that of the E protein of den-
gue virus, suggesting that KFDV domain III may
also have heparin sulphate binding property. We
have also observed that recombinant domain III
protein of KFDV binds immobilised heparan sul-
phate (Pattnaik et al., Unpublished data).

KFD VACCINE
In general the antibodies raised against viral infec-
tions are maintained for years at high levels due to
repeated re-exposure to the virus in the form
of subclinical infections or due to exposure to
closely related viruses. Even in the absence of
re-exposure, antibodies may persist for many
years, as has been shown in several arboviruses
[72–74]. Like other arboviruses, HI and compli-
ment fixing (CF) antibodies begin to rise in the first
week after the onset of KFD. Neutralising antibo-
dies appear during the second week and at 3rd
to 4th week the titres reach the peak. Antibody
mediated immunity to KFDV persists for a decade
even in the absence of re-exposure [75].
The very first vaccine tested early in the 1960s

to control KFD in the area of Shimoga district,
Mysore state of India was a 5–10% suspension of
formalin-inactivated RSSE virus (mouse brain pre-
paration) produced by Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research laboratory, Washington, USA. It was
injected subcutaneously, two doses a week apart
followed by a third dose five weeks after the sec-
ond shot. About 4000 vaccines displayed no
unwanted reaction such as allergic and febrile
reactions [76]. The vaccine induced weak HI anti-
body response but stimulated no CF antibody
response. The vaccine failed to evoke booster
response in many individuals with previous
KFDV infection. The RSSE vaccine thus was found
to be ineffective in reducing the attack rate of KFD
or in modifying the disease course [77,78].
Subsequently (in 1965), the first effort to pro-

duce KFDV was made by growing KFDV in brains
of infant Swiss albino mice and subsequent inacti-
vation by formalin. The vaccine produced retained
potency up to six months storage in refrigerator. It
induced neutralising antibodies in mice [79]. An
experimental KFDV vaccine was also produced
by growing the virus in chick embryo, but the
product was poorly immunogenic and failed to
evoke neutralising response in mice [80]. Later in
the year 1966, formalised experimental vaccine
was prepared by growing KFDV in chick embryo

fibroblasts cultures. The vaccine was found to be
immunogenic, potent, stable and safe. [81,82].
Field trails with this tissue culture vaccine yielded
satisfactory results, raising neutralising antibodies
in 50% of the vaccines and inducing protective
response in �23% vaccines [83]. Efforts were
also made to develop a live attenuated KFDV
vaccine by attenuating the strain P9605 though a
serial tissue culture passages. Langurs (P. entel-
lus) vaccinated with this attenuated KFDV gener-
ated neutralising antibodies and resisted the
challenge infection [84]. In another experiment
two dosages of formalin-killed KFDV adminis-
tered to langurs by subcutaneous route induced
neutralising antibodies. The antibodies, though
transient, could be detected up to 15 months after
first vaccination. Whereas the vaccine did not pro-
tect the langurs from challenge infection, it did
prevent death [85]. A surveillance study indicated
that the formalised KFDV vaccine has some but
not absolute protective effect on the vaccines in
Sagar-Sorab taluks of Shimoga district [50]. An
attenuated Langat virus vaccine was also tested
and showed protection against KFDV [86]. Kayser
et al. [87] studied the human antibody response to
immunisation with 17D yellow fever virus and
inactivated TBEV vaccine. They reported that vac-
cines producing HI titres� 20 against TBE showed
cross-reaction with KFD.

The formalin inactivated KFDV vaccine pro-
duced in chick embryo fibroblasts has been
licensed and is currently in use in the endemic
areas in Karnataka state of India. The places for
vaccination were selected on the basis of preva-
lence of KFDV activity in the previous years,
including the villages from which mortality in
monkeys was reported and those adjacent to the
KFDV affected areas. The efficacy of the vaccine
was satisfactory, exerting a highly significant pro-
tective effect [20]. Coverage of vaccine is fairly
good. Almost all the individuals including chil-
dren are being routinely vaccinated by the local
government authorities. However, the occurrence
of KFD cases, despite vaccination, has suggested
some changes in virus antigenic determinants in
due course. The KFDV strain currently used for
vaccine preparation was isolated late in the
1950s. Thereafter, KFDV strains have not been
well characterised at the molecular level, hence
possible antigenic drifts and diversity since its first
introduction in India during the late 1950s remain

poorly understood. Increasing trend of KFD cases
in Karnataka state warrants development of a new
vaccine preparation that includes currently circu-
lating KFDV. Improper storage of vaccine and
lack of maintenance of cold chain result in inacti-
vation of the vaccine and could be another reason
for the emergent KFD despite routine vaccination.
Until now no quick diagnostic kit is available for
early diagnosis of KFD. Most of the cases are con-
firmed based on syndromic diagnosis, HI test,
immuno-fluorescence, and neutralisation test.
Cattle have a low level of susceptibility to KFDV
and antibody persists for very long period (~5
years). Hence, cattle can be used as an indicator for
assessing past activity of KFDV in the field surveil-
lance [88] but has not been considered practicable.

CONCLUSION
KFDV, despite regional significance, carries much
importance related to origin, evolution, dispersal
and antigenic diversity of flaviviruses. It is one of
the few flaviviruses that show haemorrhagic man-
ifestations. Ecology and epidemiology of KFDV
are very unique with distinct clinical symptoms
and pathological manifestations. Although KFDV
has close phylogenetic relationship with Alkhur-
ma virus, it will be interesting to study the causes
of differences in species specificity and clinical
representation between the two viruses. Earlier
studies indicated that the antigenic structure of
KFDV could be very different from that of TBEV.
However, considering the positionally conserved
cysteines and a similar structural feature of
domain III of the E protein to those of other known
flaviviruses, it could be inferred that KFDV may
have similar receptor-ligand interaction. A com-
mon mechanism of virus-cell fusion in virus entry,
which is shared by KFDV and other flaviviruses,
has also been suggested by amino acid sequence
comparison and structural modelling of the E pro-
teins. Although the available vaccine has once suc-
cessfully controlled the KFD, the increasing trend
of the disease in the last five years irrespective of
routine vaccination is alarming. Such a trend may
be indicative of the possible mutations in exposed
antigenic domains of the virus, thereby allowing
the virus to evade the immune response generated
by the formalin inactivated vaccine. Lack of
sequence data of recent isolates of KFDV restricts
our understanding on the relationship of sequence
diversity and antigenic diversity of this virus. We

speculate that KFDV may show altered degree of
virulence due to many changing factors such as
changes of social behaviour of humans like urbani-
sation, rapid transport, and migration of people or
of vectors, large scale changes in ecology due to
deforestation, or building of dams or canals and
changing agricultural practices. Extreme patho-
genicity puts KFDV into the list of biological
agents of weapon potential [19]. In our opinion,
KFDV is unsuitable for offensive purpose because
the case fatality for KFD virus is not high, because
KFDV requires ticks for transmission and because
human to human transmission is less likely. Bio-
safety level-4 practices and containment facility
are required for all activities in handling KFDV.
Unavailability of BSL-4 facility in India has limited
the efforts for extensive molecular investigation on
KFDV. Considering the requirement of developing
safer and more effective vaccines in general, it is
important to make effort to develop an alternative
vaccine version for KFD. A recombinant sub-unit
vaccine or recombinant chimeric live vaccine
could be the options. Development of a rapid
and easy-to- use diagnostic system is also needed
for the field surveillance of KFD.

Abstract

A recent study reported neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in horses from four ranches of southern Pantanal.
To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses was conducted with 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61
caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic
disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated
by 90% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater titer, 78
(10.3%) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7.8%) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3.2%) for WNV, two (0.3%)
for Cacipacore virus and one (0.1%) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that
affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no
seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes. The detection of WNV-
seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub-
regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.

Introduction

Flaviviruses represent a group of mosquito-borne viruses in

Brazil that are annually involved in a large number of human cases

of dengue fever countrywide and sporadic local outbreaks of

sylvatic yellow fever [1], [2]. Outbreaks caused by other

flaviviruses have also been reported in the country. In the 1970s,

the largest Brazilian epidemic of arbovirus encephalitis was caused

by Rocio virus (ROCV) in southeast Brazil [3]. More recently, an

outbreak of hemorrhagic manifestations was linked to Saint Louis

encephalitis virus (SLEV) [4]. Sporadic human cases caused by

other sylvatic flaviviruses, including Bussuquara virus (BSQV),

Ilheus virus (ILHV) and Cacipacore virus (CPCV) have also been

reported in Brazil [5], [6], [7]. Furthermore, yellow fever

epizootics in howler monkeys were reported in 2008 and 2009.

Approximately 200 carcasses tested positive for Yellow fever virus

(YFV) and about 2000 deaths were reported [8].

Thirteen flaviviruses have been reported in Brazil, listed here in

chronological order of discovery: YFV, ILHV, BSQV, SLEV,

ROCV, CPCV, Dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and Dengue virus 4

(DENV-4), Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), Iguape virus (IGUV),

Naranjal-like virus (NJLV), Dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and Culex

flavivirus (CXFV) [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],

[18], [19], [20]. In 2009, serological evidence of West Nile virus

(WNV) infection in Brazilian horses, was collected for the first

time, in the Pantanal wetland region of Mato Grosso do Sul state

(MS) [21].

The Pantanal wetland is a subtropical region of great

biodiversity with strong potential for maintenance and evolution

of mosquito-borne viruses. Comprising approximately

140,000 km2, the Pantanal is a vast sedimentary floodplain

characterized by seasonal flooding which determines specific

ecosystem processes, with the occurrence of plants and animals

that are adapted to the annual shrinking and expansion of habitats

due to the seasonal hydrological regime [22]. The region, which

covers mainly Brazilian but also Paraguayan and Bolivian

territories, is ecologically classified into 11 sub-regions according

to vegetation, flooding and physiography. In Brazil, the Pantanal is

located within the states of Mato Grosso (MT) and MS in the west-

central region of the country [23].

Most of the flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or

understudied in the Pantanal. A small number of investigations in

the Nhecolândia Sub-region of the Pantanal, MS, have detected

serological evidence for four flaviviruses, including ILHV, SLEV,

WNV and CPCV [21], [24], [25]. Recently, three other

serological studies reported the detection of neutralizing antibodies

PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706



for WNV in equines from MT and again in MS, including from

outside the boundaries of the Pantanal [26], [27], [28]. Complete

surveys for flaviviruses in the Pantanal have not been reported.

Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for WNV and the 11

Brazilian flaviviruses of potential medical importance, utilizing

equines, sheep and caimans as indicators.

Materials and Methods

In October 2009, April, September and October 2010, blood

samples were taken from 724 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans

from 16 beef cattle ranches comprising an area of approximately

2,700 square-km in the Nhecolândia Sub-region of Pantanal, MS,

west-central Brazil (Figure 1).

Ethics statement
The collections for this study were approved by the Animal

Ethics Committee of Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (License CEUA-

Fiocruz LW-1/12, protocol P-74/10-5) in compliance with the

requirements of Brazilian Law 11794/2008, which rules on the

scientific use of animals, including the principles of the Brazilian

society of Science in laboratory animals. The collections were also

approved by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural

Resources (licenses IBAMA 18363-1/2009 and 18363-2/2010).

Caimans were captured in two ranches from sites where a high

concentration of these animals was observed. Caiman blood

samples were obtained by puncture of the internal jugular vein

between the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae as described previously

[29]. Information recorded about caimans included gender,

weight and snout-vent length.

Blood samples from equines, including horses, donkeys and

mules, and from sheep were taken by puncture of the jugular vein in

14 and nine different ranches, respectively. Gender, age, tameness,

breed, vaccination status, travel history outside of Pantanal and

history of abnormalities, such as clinical signs involving the central

or peripheral nervous system, were recorded for each equine

sample. Information about gender, age, breed and travel history

outside of Pantanal were also recorded for each sheep. All animals

sampled appeared healthy except for one horse that presented with

clinical signs suggestive of neurological disorder.

Additionally, 36 horse samples collected in February 2010 from

a ranch comprising roughly a 900-square-km area in the

Nabileque Sub-region of Pantanal, also located in MS (Figure 1)

were tested. An outbreak of an undiagnosed neurological

syndrome had caused the death of 16 equines at this location

from December 2009 to January 2010. All equines here were

vaccinated for rabies and tested negative for Trypanosoma evansi, a

common pathogen involved in incoordination and instability of

hind limbs in Pantanal equines. These equines had not been

vaccinated for equine encephalitis viruses at the time of the

outbreak. After the first deaths, the herd was vaccinated for eastern

and western equine encephalitis viruses.

All samples were initially screened for flavivirus-reactive

antibodies by blocking ELISA as described previously [30]. Briefly,

the ability of the sera to block the binding of the flavivirus group-

reactive monoclonal antibody 6B6C-1 to the cell lysate-derived

antigen for WNV was compared to the blocking ability of negative

control horse serum. Samples were considered seropositive when

the inhibition values produced were $30%. Samples with inhibition
values between 19 and 29% were repeated twice to confirm the

negative results. Blocking ELISA-positive samples were then heat-

inactivated and tested by PRNT90, as previously described [31], for

WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses. Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions

that ranged from 1:10–1:320 or 1:20–1:640 of each blocking ELISA

seropositive sample were tested for their ability to neutralize plaque

formation by WNV, SLEV, ILHV, CPCV, BSQV, IGUV, YFV

(vaccine strain 17D), ROCV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3

(recombinant ChimeriVax Dengue 3 virus) and DENV-4. Caiman

and sheep samples that were negative by blocking ELISA were also

tested by PRNT90 for WNV.

All reference viruses used for PRNT were previously submitted

to partial nucleotide sequencing of the N terminal region of NS5

gene to confirm viral identity. High identity scores were obtained

with the following sequences deposited at GenBank: DENV-1

(FJ562106), DENV-2 (GQ398257), DENV-3 (recombinant Chi-

meriVax Dengue 3 virus) (JN811143), DENV-4 (GQ199880),

ROCV (AY632542), SLEV (EF158048), ILHV (AY632539), YFV

(JN628279), BSQV (AY632536), CPCV (AF013367), IGUV

(AY632538), and WNV (JN819325).

Serum was considered seropositive to a virus when it reduced at

least 90% of the formation of plaques of this virus and its reciprocal

neutralizing antibody titer was at least four-fold greater than what

was observed for the other 11 tested flaviviruses. The PRNT is the

most specific serological test for the differentiation of flavivirus

infections in convalescent serum samples [32]. Type-specific

antibodies against flaviviruses can be distinguished using the PRNT

[33]. The conservative criterion of four-fold greater titer is based on

the results of cross-neutralization tests with flaviviruses and their

respective antisera used for studies of antigenic relationships [34],

[35]. Two or more flaviviruses are distinct from each other by

quantitative serological criteria (four-fold or greater differences

between homologous and heterologous titers of both serum samples)

[32]. The Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used to test for

positive trends in seroprevalence among age classes (StatXact 10.0,

Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA)

Results

All caiman and sheep serum samples were negative for

flaviviruses-specific antibodies using the 6B6C-1 monoclonal

antibody by blocking ELISA. When tested by PRNT90 for

WNV, all caiman samples confirmed negative. Sixty caiman

Author Summary

West Nile virus is maintained in cycles between birds and
mosquitoes and recently reemerged as a worldwide major
public health and veterinarian concern as the cause of
human and equine encephalitis outbreaks. Recent studies
have reported serological evidence of West Nile virus
circulation in Pantanal, west-central region of Brazil.
However, considering the co-circulation of various cross-
reactive flaviviruses in Brazil and that most of the
flaviviruses isolated in Brazil are unknown or understudied
in the Pantanal, serological results should be interpreted
with caution. Therefore, we conducted a serosurvey for
West Nile virus and the 11 Brazilian flaviviruses of potential
medical importance, utilizing equines, sheep and caimans
as indicators, including 32 equines collected from a ranch
where a neurologic disorder had been recently reported
among the equines. We found serological evidence of
Ilheus, Saint Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Cacipacore and
Rocio viruses in Pantanal equines. West Nile virus infection
was not associated with the neurological disease of
equines. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in
ten ranches and ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines in
fourteen ranches of two different sub-regions of Pantanal
is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these
flaviviruses in the region.

samples had PRNT90 titer ,10 and one ,40 for WNV (low
sample volume of the latter required testing at a lowest dilution of

1:40). From 238 sheep samples tested, 235 had PRNT90 titers ,
10, two showed low neutralizing antibodies titers of 20 and 10 and

one ,40. From 760 equine samples initially screened for
flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA, 396 (52.1%)

were positive. When this subset was tested using PRNT90, 332

(43.7%) had neutralizing reactivity (PRNT90 titer $10) for ILHV,
251 (33%) for SLEV, 172 (22.6%) for WNV, 139 (18.3%) for

CPCV, 130 (17.1%) for ROCV, 62 (8.2%) for IGUV, 14 (1.8%)

for YFV, 12 (1.6%) for BSQV, four (0.5%) for DENV-1, three

(0.4%) for DENV-2, one (0.1%) for DENV-4 and none for

DENV-3 (Table 1). Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater

PRNT90 titer, 77 (10.1%) equines were seropositive for ILHV, 59

(7.8%) for SLEV, 24 (3.2%) for WNV (see Table 2), two (0.3%) for

CPCV and one (0.1%) for ROCV. From the remaining 232

blocking ELISA positive samples, 227 (29.9%) were considered

seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus due to cross-reactivity

and five (0.6%) were considered seronegative with neutralizing

antibodies titers ,20 or ,10 for all of the flaviviruses that were
assayed by PRNT90. These five may represent infections by an

unknown flavivirus.

Widespread West Nile Virus in Pantanal Equines

PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 4 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706



There were no seropositive equines using the four-fold antibody

titer difference criterion for BSQV, YFV, IGUV, DENV-1,

DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Monotypic neutralization

reactions (i.e. a sample that reacted with only one of the 12

flaviviruses in the panel) were detected for ILHV (n = 27), SLEV

(n = 11) and WNV (n = 6).

The only horse from Nhecolândia Sub-region that presented

neurological signs was seropositive for undifferentiated flavivirus

with the following PRNT90 titers: 80 for SLEV, 40 for ILHV,

20 for YFV, 10 for ROCV and ,10 for all other flaviviruses
tested.

Neutralizing antibodies for WNV were detected in 172 equines

from all 15 ranches that equines were tested. Considering the four-

fold higher titer criterion as confirmation, the 24 confirmed WNV-

seropositive equines were detected in ten ranches comprising an

area of approximately 2,500 square-km in the Nhecolândia and

Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located in MS (Figure 2).

Besides the 24 WNV-seropositive equines, samples from 37 other

equines presented PRNT90 titers for WNV $40 and among them
26 showed equal or higher titers for one of the other flaviviruses

tested. For these 37 equines, the serology profile could not be

interpreted to determine whether WNV reactivity was due to

infection with WNV or cross-reactivity from other flavivirus

infections. In fact, six of them were considered seropositive for one

of the 11 other flavivirus tested (Table 3). Low level of neutralizing

antibodies was detected for YFV, BSQV, IGUV, DENV-1,

DENV-2 and DENV-4 even though none of the equines were

considered infected with these viruses. In some cases, the PRNT90
titers for YFV, BSQV and IGUV exceeded 20.

Both ILHV- and SLEV-seropositive equines were detected in

14 of the 15 ranches that equines were tested, comprising roughly

a 3,100-square-km area. The only ranch that had no ILHV- and

SLEV-seropositive equines was ranch PS (Figure 2).

From 760 equines tested, 441 (58%) had date of birth available.

Stratifying the serology results by age demonstrated that risk of

exposure to flaviviruses increased with age for flaviviruses in

general and for ILHV (1-tailed p,0.001 for both), but not for
SLEV (p = 0.17) or WNV (p = 0.46) (Figure 3). SLEV and WNV

appeared to increase in prevalence with age for equines ,9 years
of age, but not for older animals.

Equines seropositive for CPCV and ROCV were sampled in

October 2009. The two CPCV-seropositive horses were five and

seven years of age and were from ranch PQ, which comprises an

area of approximately 140 square-km. The only horse that was

seropositive for ROCV had no record of birth date and was from

ranch PM that encompasses a 360-square-km area.

At the end of 2009, an outbreak of neurologic disease among

horses was reported from ranch PV located in the Nabileque Sub-

region. From 36 equines sampled, 23 (63.8%) were seropositive for

flavivirus infection by blocking ELISA. When this subset was tested

by PRNT90, 11 (30.5%) confirmed seropositive for SLEV, nine

(25.0%) for undifferentiated flavivirus(es), two (5.5%) for WNV, and

one (2.8%) for ILHV (Table 4). Of the nine undifferentiated

flavivirus infections, five had SLEV titers .20 and five had higher
SLEV titers than other flaviviruses in the panel, indicating that a

majority of these could have had a history of SLEV infection. In

addition to the relatively low seroprevalence for WNV of just 5.5%

in this sample of 36 equines, four equines from this group that

recovered from the recent neurologic syndrome were serologically

negative for WNV (Table 4). In spite of recent vaccination against

equine encephalitis viruses, most equines had low titers for equine

encephalitis viruses. These results will be described separately.

Discussion

In the absence of direct viral detection, diagnosis of arbovirus

infections is performed by indirect serological tests. However, cross-

reactive antibody responses to closely related flaviviruses can

complicate interpretation of serologic test results [36]. In particular,

secondary flavivirus infections generate high levels of cross-reactive

antibodies, which further complicate the interpretation of flavivirus

serology. The cross-reacting antibodies of primary infections

typically react with other members of the Japanese encephalitis

virus serogroup comprised by WNV, CPCV, SLEV and others

principally in Africa and Asia [37], [38], but antibodies generated

by secondary flavivirus infections can also bind and neutralize

viruses of other serogroups as well. Moreover, some individuals that

are sequentially infected by a heterologous flavivirus species can

boost antibody levels against the original virus, resulting in a

phenomenon known as ‘original antigenic sin’ which can lead to

incorrect diagnoses [39]. Finally, the potential circulation of

unknown flaviviruses in the region could generate cross-reacting

neutralizing antibodies, and lead to misinterpretation. Therefore,

we used a conservative threshold for detection of neutralizing

antibodies (90%) and we considered homotypic serologic responses

to be the most reliable, as these samples reacted with just one of the

12 viruses employed in the tests, with no indication of cross-reaction.

In the present study, serological evidence of ILHV, SLEV,

WNV, CPCV and ROCV circulation was detected in the

Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of Pantanal. Nhecolândia

is the second largest sub-region of Pantanal comprising roughly

27,000 square-km or 19% of the total Pantanal area and it is the

world’s largest and most diverse area of subtropical lakes [40],

[41]. Nabileque is the fifth largest sub-region comprising roughly

14,000 square-km or 10% of the total Pantanal area. This sub-

region is formed by fluvial plains of the Paraguay River and

remains flooded for nine months or more during the year [42].

The seroprevalence of ILHV and all flaviviruses combined

increased with age in equines (Figure 3). This temporal pattern

implies low-level enzootic transmission, where risk of infection

increases with time. A drop in seroprevalence in the oldest age

category that was observed consistently for all the flaviviruses

evaluated may be explained by either waning of detectable

antibodies over time, and/or weakening of the humoral immune

response in older animals. In the case of SLEV and WNV,

seroprevalence appeared to increase with age in the youngest three

age categories, through age 9 years old, but the sample sizes were

insufficient to detect a statistically significant trend. These

increases in the youngest age groups may be explained by one

or more introductions with establishment or not of these viruses

after 2000 (i.e. within 9 years of the sampling time point in 2009–

Widespread West Nile Virus in Pantanal Equines

2010). This finding corroborates the negative results found in a

serosurvey conducted with local equines in the 1990s, when no

neutralizing antibodies for SLEV were detected [24]. These data

also corroborate the results of two other equine serosurveys

conducted in the Nhecolândia Sub-region in February 2007 and

February 2009, when neutralizing antibodies to SLEV were

detected in three and four year old equines, respectively, which

suggests that SLEV circulated between 2004–2007 [25] and 2005–

2009 [21], coinciding with two human outbreaks caused by SLEV

in Argentina in 2005 [43] and southeast Brazil in 2006 [4].

In the present study, the detection of SLEV- and ILHV-

seropositive geldings both born in September 26, 2009 and

sampled on September 30, 2010 with no history of travel outside

of Pantanal indicates that the transmission of SLEV and ILHV

had occurred as recently as late 2009 or 2010. The enzootic status

of ILHV is corroborated by the concurrent isolation of ILHV from

Aedes scapularis specimens captured in the Nhecolândia Sub-region

in 2010 [44].

Regarding WNV, the youngest seropositive equine was a 2

year-old untamed mare with no history of travel. Because it was

sampled on October 23, 2009, the infection occurred between

2007 and 2009.

The confirmed WNV-seropositive equines were detected in ten

ranches comprising an area of approximately 2,500 square-km in

the Nhecolândia and Nabileque sub-regions of the Pantanal, located

in MS. Monotypic neutralizing reactions for WNV were detected in

six ranches encompassing roughly 1,300 square-km, which com-

prise approximately 20% of the Nhecolândia Sub-region area.

WNV-seropositive equines were detected in Nhecolândia and

Nabileque ranches located roughly 90 and 100 km distant from the

city of Corumbá, MS respectively (Figure 2). Considering the

detection of arbovirus activity in the Nabileque Sub-region which

borders Bolivia and Paraguay, these two countries should consider

our findings for their arbovirus surveillance programs.

The two CPCV-seropositive equines were sampled October 20,

2009 at five years of age and no history of travel outside of

Pantanal, which indicates that infection had occurred between

2004 and 2009.

We report here for the first time the detection of ROCV-

neutralizing antibodies in the Pantanal region. ROCV, which is an

indigenous Brazilian flavivirus, was the causative agent of an

extensive encephalitis epidemic in southeastern Brazil in the 1970s

[3]. The detection of neutralizing antibodies for ROCV was

unexpected, as current transmission events for ROCV are rare.

Considering that the only ROCV-seropositive equine had no birth

date available, the timing of ROCV transmission could not be

clarified. No ROCV-seropositive equines were detected in two

previous serosurveys for flaviviruses conducted in the same region

[21], [24], which could indicate low circulation or recent

introduction of ROCV in the Pantanal.

No seropositivity for BSQV, IGUV, YFV and DENVs was

confirmed among the equines tested in the present study.

However, except for DENV-3, neutralizing antibodies were found

to all the flaviviruses tested. More investigation is needed to

understand the potential circulation of these viruses in the

Pantanal region, as they may be restricted to ecological cycles

for which equines, sheep and caiman fail to serve as indicators. A

serosurvey of non-human primates and/or local human residents

would be more instructive for these flaviviruses. Testing only

equines may provide a biased view of the relative amounts of

flavivirus transmission because equines may not mount immune

responses to all viruses equally, or they may not attract all vectors

equally. For example, they failed to generate primary immune

responses to DENV-2 and SLEV [45] and would not attract

large numbers of the yellow fever vector mosquitoes, which

are primate specialists [46]. However, they are frequently exposed

to mosquitoes and often utilized for arbovirus serosurveys

elsewhere.

For future flavivirus serosurveys to be held in the Pantanal, not

only ILHV, SLEV, WNV, CPCV and ROCV should be included

as differential diagnosis, but also those flaviviruses for which

neutralizing antibodies titers $20 were detected, including BSQV,
IGUV and YFV, if a PRNT with a four-fold greater titer criterion

is used.

Regarding the 36 equines collected from ranch PV in the

Nabileque Sub-region of Pantanal after a neurologic disorder

outbreak occurred in 2009 and 2010, no serological evidence was

found linking this epizootic to WNV, which is currently the only

flavivirus known to be involved in outbreaks of equine

neurological disorders in the New World. Three of four survivors

of the recent neurologic syndrome had elevated titers for SLEV,

and one was the highest SLEV titer detected in the herd,

suggesting that the etiologic agent was a flavivirus that triggered a

boost of pre-existing SLEV antibody or that SLEV infection may

have been associated with the neurologic syndrome as a

contributing risk factor perhaps through antibody enhancement.

Equines experimentally infected with SLEV have not developed

overt disease [47]. However, the possibility that a novel equine-

Widespread West Nile Virus in Pantanal Equines

PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 8 February 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e2706



virulent strain of SLEV caused the neurologic disease in horses in

Brazil also merits exploration. SLEV genotype VB was recently

isolated from the brain of a single horse that died of encephalitis

in the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil, in March 2009

[48]. Of the 36 equines tested from ranch PV, 11 (30.6%) were

confirmed seropositive for SLEV, the highest seropositivity

compared to 13 other ranches where SLEV-seropositive equines

were found (and where maximum seroprevalence was 14%) and

significantly higher than SLEV seropositivity detected in all

Nhecolândia equines combined (48/724, 6.6%) (p,0.001, chi-
square test). The true SLEV infection rate is probably underes-

timated, as several probable SLEV infections could not be

differentiated due to masking by cross-reactive antibodies.

Ecological differences between Nabileque and Nhecolândia sub-

regions, the former formed by fluvial plains of the Paraguay River

and the latter mainly comprised of savannah with subtropical

lakes, may have contributed to the difference of seroprevalence

encountered in these two sub-regions. Also, the Nabileque ranch

is the largest ranch sampled encompassing a 900-square-km area,

including portions of the plateau bordering the Pantanal. The

high seropositivity for SLEV in Nabileque ranch may reflect

higher circulation of SLEV in the plateau surrounding Pantanal

than in the floodplains of Pantanal.

Amphibians and reptiles may play a larger role in the

transmission cycle of arboviruses than previously assumed.

Because of their high energy conversion efficiency, ectotherms

typically represent a large portion of the vertebrate biomass in

many ecosystems, and may therefore greatly influence transmis-

sion dynamics, either as virus amplifiers or dilution hosts [49].

Juvenile Alligator mississippiensis has been shown to develop

sufficient WNV viremia to infect blood-feeding mosquitoes

[50], [51]. A recent study reported the first evidence of WNV

exposure in wild Morelet’s crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) in
Mexico [52].

Because of widespread, high prevalence of the yacare caiman

(Caiman crocodilus yacare) in the Brazilian Pantanal, about 3.9 million

non-hatchling caimans in 1993 [53], and its potential to naturally

amplify WNV in the region, in February of 2009 a serosurvey for

flaviviruses was conducted with 30 free-ranging caimans and all

animals tested negative for flavivirus antibodies. Despite the

negative results, in the same study equines temporally and spatially

associated with the seronegative caimans showed neutralizing

antibodies for ILHV, SLEV, WNV and CPCV [21]. Taking into

account these data, in the present study a wider serosurvey for

flaviviruses was conducted with 61 free-ranging caimans from the

Nhecolândia Sub-region, but all caimans tested negative for

flavivirus antibodies by blocking ELISA and also by PRNT90 for

WNV. The absence of serological evidence of flavivirus circulation

in caimans was unexpected. Possible explanations for these

findings are: (i) low circulation of flavivirus in caimans, (ii) caimans

may not mount immune responses to flaviviruses and, finally, (iii)

caimans may not attract local mosquito vectors of flaviviruses.

In a study conducted also in the Pantanal, but in a different sub-

region, 80% of mosquitoes caught blood-feeding on caimans were

Culex (Melanoconion) theobaldi and Mansonia spp. [54], species that are

not usually reported as flavivirus vectors. However, more recently,

ILHV was isolated from Aedes scapularis, which was the most
prevalent species caught landing or blood-feeding on caimans

from the Nhecolândia Sub-region [44].

The absence of serological evidence of flavivirus circulation in

sheep by blocking ELISA and the detection of only two samples

with neutralizing antibodies for WNV in very low titers was also an

unexpected result, considering that the tested sheep were

temporally and spatially associated with equines that were

seropositive for various flaviviruses. However, reports of serolog-

ical evidence of WNV infection in sheep are scarce and have been

showing low prevalence [55], [56]. Possible explanations for these

findings are the low prevalence of Brazilian flaviviruses in sheep,

or that sheep fail to develop antibodies for Brazilian flaviviruses

following exposure by mosquito bite, or finally, that sheep may not

attract local mosquito flavivirus vectors in the Pantanal region. An

entomological study conducted in southeast Brazil in the 1980s

showed that sheep was not an attractive host for mosquitoes

compared with man, horse and cattle [57].

Conclusion
In the present study, serological evidence of ILHV, SLEV,

WNV, CPCV and ROCV circulation was detected in equines of

the Pantanal. Severe disease has been linked to these viruses in

humans [7], [13], [43], [58], [59] and for WNV also in equines

[60]. WNV and SLEV circulation in the Pantanal appears to be a

recent phenomenon. In the last three decades, the Pantanal has

been impacted by the conversion of natural vegetation into

agricultural fields and cattle pasture, with alteration and loss of

natural habitats and biodiversity. Moreover, major negative

impacts occur in uplands, with drastic deforestation of savanna

vegetation, where main rivers feeding the Pantanal have their

springs [22], [61]. These environmental changes in the Pantanal

environs can directly impact the fluctuations of vector and

vertebrate host populations, which could affect arbovirus trans-

mission dynamics in the region. Loss of wetlands and other natural

habitats typically leads to reduced biodiversity, and consequently

increased risk of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases [62].

Preserving large wetland areas sustains biodiversity and may

represent a valuable ecosystem-based approach for controlling

WNV outbreaks [63]. Indeed, an outbreak of neurologic disease

among equines reported herein occurred in a ranch that

encompasses drier plateau ecosystem on the periphery of the

Pantanal wetlands. Serology data suggest that an unknown

flavivirus closely related to SLEV or a newly recognized equine-

virulent strain of SLEV may be associated with this neurologic

syndrome.

Considering the highly conservative criteria used in the present

study, the detection of seropositive equines for ILHV, SLEV,

WNV, CPCV and ROCV is strong evidence for local circulation

of these flaviviruses in the Pantanal of MS, Brazil. These

flaviviruses should be included as differential diagnosis in future

flavivirus serosurveys to be held in the region. For PRNT studies,

not only these flaviviruses, but also YFV, BSQV and IGUV should

be included.

It appears that WNV circulated recently in the Pantanal. The

detection of WNV-seropositive equines in at least ten ranches is

strong evidence of recent widespread circulation, but not

necessarily establishment of WNV in the region. Circulation of

WNV in this area has not yet been confirmed by virus isolation.

Because detection of antibodies is indirect evidence of flavivirus

circulation and because novel flaviviruses may exist in the region,

we encourage efforts to isolate viruses to confirm the circulation of

these flaviviruses. In future investigations of equine epizootics,

efforts should be concentrated on the collection of samples suitable

for viral isolation.

Abstract: We evaluated the prevalence of WNV and SLEV neutralizing antibodies in captive and free-ranging

raptors from Argentina by plaque-reduction neutralization test. Eighty plasma samples from 12 species were

analyzed. Only one captive adult Crowned Eagle (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus) was WNV seropositive (preva-

lence: 1.25%; antibody titer of 1:80). Two captive Crowned Eagles were SLEV seropositive (prevalence: 2.50%;

antibody titers: 1:80 and 1:40).These findings expand the geographic distribution of WNV and SLEV and

confirm their activity in central and northeastern Argentina. West Nile virus activity in Argentina may rep-

resent a potential threat to Crowned Eagles and other endangered raptors in this country.

Since its arrival to North America in 1999 and subsequent

dissemination through Central and South America (Nash

et al. 2001; Komar and Clark 2006; Diaz et al. 2008; Pet-

ersen and Hayes 2008; Hunsperger et al. 2009), concern has

been raised about the possible effect of West Nile virus

(WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) on immunologically naı̈ve

and endangered Neotropical birds populations (Saggese

2007; Blitvich 2008; Bataille et al. 2009). Raptors (Orders

Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, and Estrigiformes) are

particularly susceptible to WNV infection (Wünschmann

et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010). High

morbidity and mortality of raptors has been reported in the

USA, Canada, and Europe (Gancz et al. 2004; Saito et al.

2007; Höfle et al. 2008; Nemeth et al. 2007, 2009). Different

studies conducted in experimentally inoculated birds and

also on free-ranging raptors show a gradient of no obvious

illness, subclinical, clinical manifestation, and death across

raptors infected with WNV (Nemeth et al. 2006; Ellis et al.

2007; Jiménez-Clavero et al. 2008; Ziegler et al. 2013).Published online: August 9, 2014

Currently, 136 species of diurnal and nocturnal birds

of prey inhabit South America and 18.3% of them are

considered threatened or near-threatened (BirdLife 2013).

Combined with other well-recognized threats, avian

pathogens may have a negative impact on wild raptor

populations (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Those species

with limited geographic distribution, reduced natural

numbers, fragmented populations, and low heterozygosis

are highly susceptible to the deleterious effects of emerging

diseases, like WNV (Newton 2002; Saggese 2007). Threa-

tened and non-threatened species of raptors maintained in

zoos and rehabilitation centers for ex situ conservation

programs may be at risk as well (Saggese 2007).

WNV activity was detected in several central and

northern Argentinian provinces, evidenced by the detection

of neutralizing antibodies (PRNTAb), in a large mosaic of

avian species, starting in the early 2000s (Diaz et al. 2008,

2011). Although no human encephalitis outbreak by WNV

was reported, sporadic febrile human cases were observed.

Beyond these few pieces of information, data surrounding

distribution and impact of WNV in South America are

scarce (Komar and Clark 2006; Morales et al. 2006; Peter-

sen and Hayes 2008; Diaz et al. 2008).

Another flavivirus co-circulating and re-emerging in

the American continent is St. Louis encephalitis virus

(SLEV) (Spinsanti et al. 2009), which is broadly distributed

in subtropical and temperate areas of Argentina (Dı́az et al.

2013). Although birds are not affected by SLEV infection,

they have an essential role in the transmission and main-

tenance of this virus (Reisen 2003).

The presence of WNV activity in Argentina may rep-

resent a considerable potential threat to both free-ranging

and captive birds (Saggese 2007). However, the pattern of

WNV and SLEV infection in Argentinean raptors remains

basically unknown. In this study we evaluated the preva-

lence of WNV and SLEV antibodies in captive and free-

ranging birds of prey from Argentina.

Sampling was conducted between March 2007 and

April 2010 at selected zoos and wildlife rehabilitation

centers and free-ranging raptors located in different geo-

graphic areas of Argentina (Table 1).

Plasma samples were tested for specific SLEV and

WNV antibodies by plaque-reduction neutralization test

(PRNT) using autochthonous viral strains (WNV ArE/

729906 or SLEV CbaAr-4005). The etiologic agent

responsible for the infection was identified in serum diluted

at least 1/10 following Diaz et al. (2008).

A total of 80 plasma samples from 12 species of Ac-

cipitriformes, 5 species of Falconiformes, and 4 species of

Estrigiformes were analyzed. Only monotypic immuno-

logical reactions were detected, no cross-reaction between

viruses was observed. Only one sample was WNV sero-

positive (prevalence: 1.25%; 1/80), an adult Crowned Eagle

(antibody titer: 1:80) (Table 1) held captive in Casa

Grande, Córdoba in January 2008 (Fig. 1).

Two Crowned Eagles, one from Güira Oga, Misiones

province and another one from Buenos Aires city, had

detectable NTAb against SLEV (titers: 1:80 and 1:40,

respectively). Overall, the prevalence of SLEV NTAb was

2.50% (2/80).

The adult Crowned Eagle WNV seropositive was a

captive bird housed with other birds of prey in an open-air

aviary located in a rural-suburban environment of the Dry

Chaco Eco region. Interestingly, a few days before sam-

pling, an adult Crowned Eagle housed in the same aviary

was found dead, although necropsy and additional post-

mortem investigation were not pursued by the zoo. This

finding confirms exposure in an endangered species, ex-

pands the geographic distribution of WNV, and confirms

its activity within Cordoba province (Diaz et al. 2008).

Cordoba city, 81 km away, was the nearest site of WNV

activity previously reported in raptors: an American kestrel

(Falco sparverius) had been previously found seropositive,

with a bird community seroprevalence of 1.1% between

January 2005 and June 2006 (Dı́az et al. 2011), 2 years

before our result reported here. At the moment, the others

birds of prey seropositive for WNV in Argentina come

from another American kestrel and a Rufous-thighed Hawk

(Accipiter erythronemius), from a rural area of Northeastern

Cordoba province and from an urban site of Tucuman

province, respectively (Dı́az et al. 2011).

The apparent absence of WNV activity in sampled

raptors could be a result of the limited sampling size in

some sites. However, a relatively large number of raptors

tested in Misiones (33 individuals/17 species) were also

negative. The lack of WNV seropositive birds in Misiones

province is surprising considering recent reports of WNV

activity in the closer Corrientes and Chaco provinces,

where free-ranging black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya)

had a seroprevalence of 19.81% in 2010 (Morales et al.

2011). Furthermore, this lack of exposure could indicate a

high susceptibility to future infection and a potential

conservation risk for endangered captive and free-ranging

raptors inhabiting Misiones. Güira Oga is home to one of

604 Agustin I. Quaglia et al.

the largest captive collections of forest eagles in Argentina

and these birds have a high value for ex situ conservation

programs.

Contrasting with the WNV activity in USA and Canada,

no mortality events have been reported in Neotropical birds

(Komar and Clark 2006; Dı́az et al. 2011). Reasons for this

difference are not clearly understood, but circulation of bird-

attenuated viral strains, avian host WNV infection resistant,

co-circulation of antigenically related flaviviruses, and dilu-

tion effect of viral activity in a richer mosquito and avian

community have been suggested (Gubler 2007; Swaddle and

Calos 2008; Keesing et al. 2010). Moreover, lack of a proper

surveillance system could likely encrypt the actual WNV

activity in the region (Petersen and Hayes 2008).

One adult Crowned Eagle SLEV seropositive was a

captive female in Güira Oga for more than 12 years and

Figure 1. Spatial distribution of WNV and

SLEV seropositive and seronegative raptors in

Argentina, 2007–2010.

WNV and SLEV Seroprevalence in Raptors, Argentina 607



sampled in March 2008. Based on its antibody titer of 1:80

we suspect that SLEV infection was recently acquired.

Hodara et al. (1991) described SLEV seropositive people

when studying prevalence of several arthropod-borne dis-

eases in Misiones province, but technical limitations of

their work precluded conclusions about the exact identity

of the specific antibodies (a non-specific hemagglutination

inhibition test was used by these investigators). Therefore,

this is the first confirmation of SLEV activity in this

province.

The other SLEV positive Crowned Eagle was a juvenile

found in San Juan province (western Argentina) and

moved to Buenos Aires for rehabilitation 2 months before

the sampling date (April 2009). The low titer (1:40) and the

history of recent movement suggests two potential sce-

narios for the infection origin. Between January and May

2009, a SLEV case was registered in Buenos Aires (López

et al. 2011) suggesting infection of this bird may have oc-

curred during this time. Alternatively, if this eagle was in-

fected in San Juan before its arrival in Buenos Aires, this

would demonstrate viral circulation at least 2 years previ-

ous to a recent urban outbreak (López et al. 2011).

Unfortunately, no other birds were investigated for SLEV

NTAb.

Recently, the use of zoo collections and rescue centers

has been advocated for disease surveillance (Nemeth et al.

2007; Pultorak et al. 2011). In Argentina, human health

surveillance programs are designed to report encephalitis

and fever syndromes with infrequent etiological confir-

mation, although prophylactic measures are rarely imple-

mented as result. Raptors, and other species of birds, are

highly susceptible to WNV and SLEV infection (Wünsch-

mann et al. 2005; Nemeth et al. 2009; Hull et al. 2010)

mounting an antibody response to detectable levels by

serological tests such as ELISA and PRNT (Nemeth et al.

2007). Zoo and rehabilitation centers house a large number

of birds from different orders including raptors, parrots,

waterfowl, etc. that could constitute an excellent, sensitive,

and operative source of biomedical samples for WNV and

SLEV activity surveillance (Nemeth et al. 2007; Pultorak

et al. 2011).

Our data confirm the endemic circulation of WNV in

the province of Cordoba, according with previous evidence

and suggest a wide geographic distribution of SLEV and

WNV in Argentina (Diaz et al. 2008). Our limited sample size

did not allow confirming the absence of viral activity in

raptors at locations where only seronegative birds were

found, potentially underestimating the real infection status

of raptors at the present time. However, this represents the

first screening for flavivirus serological status in birds of prey

at a large spatial scale in Argentina and South America.

Abstract

From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds comprising 152 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and
released at four study areas within California, from which 28,388 additional serum samples were collected at
one or more recapture encounters. Of these, 142, 99, and 1929 birds from 41 species were positive for
neutralizing antibodies against western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus
(SLEV), or West Nile virus (WNV) at initial capture or recapture, respectively. Overall, 83% of the positive
serum samples were collected from five species: House Finch, House Sparrow, Mourning Dove, California
Quail, and Western Scrub-Jay. Temporal data supported concurrent arbovirus surveillance and documented the
disappearance of birds positive for WEEV in 2008 and SLEV in 2003 and the appearance of birds positive for
WNV after its invasion in 2003. Results of these serosurveys agreed well with the host selection patterns of the
Culex vectors as described from bloodmeal sequencing data and indicated that transmission of WNV seemed
most effective within urban areas where avian and mosquito host diversity was limited to relatively few
competent species.

Introduction

The mosquitoborne encephalitis viruses, includingwestern equine encephalomyelitis virus (Togaviridae,
Alphavirus, WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (Flavivir-
idae, Flavivirus, SLEV), and West Nile virus (Flaviviridae,
Flavivirus, WNV), were or are now endemic to California.
WEEV originally was isolated in 1930 from a horse that
succumbed from encephalitis in Merced County during a
large epizootic of equine disease in the Central Valley of
California (Meyer et al. 1931). SLEV was recognized as a
cause of summer encephalitis in residents of the San Joaquin
Valley in 1937 (Howitt 1939), soon after its initial isolation in
Missouri (Muckenfuss et al. 1934). Both viruses remained
active each summer in the Central Valley, where they were an
important public and veterinary health concern through the
1980s, with enzootic and occasional epidemic-level trans-
mission (Reeves et al. 1990). Subsequently, the activity of
both viruses declined in the Central Valley (Reisen et al.
1990), with the exception of a small SLEV outbreak of hu-
man disease in the San Joaquin Valley in 1989 (Reisen et al.

1992b) and widespread zoonotic transmission of WEEV in
the Sacramento Valley in 1993 (Reisen et al. 1995a). An
outbreak of SLEV also was documented in Los Angeles in
1984 (Murray et al. 1985), with continued low-level enzootic
transmission (Work et al. 1985, Reisen et al. 1992c) recorded
occasionally through 2003. Enzootic transmission of WEEV
and SLEV was documented consistently in the southeastern
deserts of California from 1967 through 2003 (Meylan et al.
1989, Reisen et al. 1992a, 1996c, Reisen et al. 2002), with
infrequent human disease (Reisen et al. 1996a, Reisen and
Chiles 1997). Although enzootic WEEV transmission was
detected briefly in 2005–2007, SLEV essentially disappeared
from California from 2004 through 2013.

WNV invaded California through the southeastern deserts
during 2003 (Reisen et al. 2004), just 5 years after being
discovered in New York City (Lanciotti et al. 1999), spread to
every county in the state by the end of 2004 (Hom et al. 2004),
and has remained continually active since this time, with
human disease detected annually (Feiszli et al. 2013). WEEV
and SLEV were not detected in mosquitoes from 2007 and
2003, respectively, through 2013, despite the continued

testing of mosquito samples (pools) for all three viruses
(Fig. 1). Widespread vaccination and natural immunization
have limited the number of equine cases of both WEEV and
WNV diseases reported annually.

The cascade of events that have led to the above transitions
in arbovirus activity remain unclear, although the California
landscape has changed dramatically since the 1930s. The
state human population has grown from ca. 7M in 1930 to
37M by 2010, with extensive urbanization of the Los Angeles
Basin and the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley. Ex-
tensive intermittent wetlands of the Central Valley have been
converted to farmland, and vernal runoff is now managed by
engineering projects along the western slope of the Sierra
Nevada. Concurrently agricultural production has risen from
$7.3 billion in 1974 to $45 billion/year in 2011, even though
some of the original farmland was converted to housing. This
increase in farm production followed the completion of the
extensive Central Valley Water Project bringing Sacramento
River water into the arid west side of the San Joaquin Valley
through several major canal systems and to Los Angeles
through the California Aqueduct (www.water.ca.gov/swp/
cvp.cfm, accessed 30 Aug 2015). Agriculture in the San
Joaquin Valley transitioned from cotton and fodder to carrots,
grapes, almonds, and dairy production. Following an exten-
sive drought in the 1980s, farming practices such as tailwater
recycling and laser leveling were adopted to conserve water.
Collectively, these changes to the California landscape al-
tered mosquito and avian populations and impacted arbovirus
epidemiology (Reeves and Milby 1989). In addition, the
epidemics that followed the invasion of California by WNV
resulted in the expansion and improvement of mosquito
control programs.

Birds are the vertebrate hosts for these three encephalitis
viruses and therefore have been studied intensively since
their role in transmission was discovered in the 1940s
(Hammon et al. 1943). Extensive field studies during 1946–
1951 in Kern County carefully characterized bird commu-
nities in rural, agrarian, and periurban habitats, documented
their seasonality and migration status, and described their
nesting habits (McClure et al. 1962). A subset of these birds

were tested for antibodies using a mouse protection neutral-
ization assay, of which 17% (n = 1147) and 9% (n = 1039)
were positive for WEEV and SLEV antibodies, respectively
(Reeves and Hammon 1962). Of the bird species tested,
House Finches, House Sparrows, and Bullock’s Orioles were
positive most frequently. The adaptation of the hemaggluti-
nation inhibition assay allowed for rapid and extensive test-
ing of wild birds to detect the prevalence antibodies. During
1952–1973 in Kern County and 1969–1973 in Butte and
Glenn Counties, a total of 14,713 blood samples from 131
species of wild birds were tested for antibodies, of which 4%
were positive for WEEV and 3% for SLEV, respectively
(Milby and Reeves 1990), a marked decline from the previ-
ous survey, although resident peridomestic passerines again
emerged as the most frequently infected species.

Our studies on the role of birds in the ecology of arbo-
viruses commenced at wetlands along the Salton Sea in the
Coachella Valley in 1996, following our discovery that
WEEV and SLEV seemed to overwinter in this area and then
disperse upland in the Coachella Valley (Reisen et al. 1995b,
1995c) and perhaps to other areas of California. The com-
bination of agricultural, desert, and wetland habitats in this
area along the Pacific Flyway has enabled one of the most
diverse avifauna in North America, with >380 species listed
at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (www.fws.gov/
refuge/Sonny_Bono_Salton_Sea/wildlife_and_habitat/index
.html, accessed 19 Nov 2015). We were interested to deter-
mine which of these species were infected most frequently,
may disseminate virus elsewhere, and how these results re-
lated to our understanding of mosquito host-seeking behav-
ior (Lothrop and Reisen 2001), host selection (Thiemann
et al. 2012, Reisen et al. 2013a), and arboviral amplification.
For comparison, similar studies were initiated in Kern
County in 1997 at some of the same collection sites used
previously by McClure and colleagues (Milby and Reeves
1990), allowing us to investigate the impact of landscape
change in the San Joaquin Valley on antibody seroprevalence
within the avian community. After the arrival of WNV, ad-
ditional sampling was initiated at urban habitats in Los An-
geles in 2003 (Kwan et al. 2012) and at suburban and rural

habitats at the city of Davis in the Sacramento Valley (un-
published data). The current article summarizes data on birds
that became infected and survived to produce antibody and
therefore compliments our recent article on those birds that
succumbed during infection and were tested as part of the
dead bird surveillance program for WNV (Foss et al. 2015).

Materials and Methods

Bird collection areas were selected near wetlands around
the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, Riverside County, in the
San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield, Kern County, and in the
Sacramento Valley near Davis, Yolo County, and at multiple
urban sites throughout Los Angeles. The locations of fre-
quently used collection sites are summarized in Table 1.
Additional sites were tried and then discontinued because of
low collection success, vandalism, or other logistical reasons.
Multiple net lanes and bird trap sites were tried at each lo-
cation until productive positions were selected for repeated
sampling. For netting, three sites at each of the three areas
were selected each season and sampled on two consecutive
days during each 2-week period, depending upon weather.
Each site contained from 7 to 15 mist net locations and
multiple small and large grain-baited traps, except for Los
Angeles sites where a single modified crow trap was operated
at each of seven fixed sites. Mist nets were mostly 2.6 · 12
meters with 38-mm mesh (some with 60-mm mesh were used
to collect large birds) and were operated starting at dawn for
3–5 h each day, depending upon catch size and weather.
Australian crow traps with drop-in top slits modified for
sparrows and/or walk-in bottom cone entrances (McClure
1984) were baited with mixed wild birdseed and water and
operated for 24 h for 2 days at each location during each
sampling rotation. Additional bird serum samples were col-
lected opportunistically, including samples from waterfowl
at the Kern NWR during an avian cholera outbreak, birds
taken to wildlife rehabilitation centers, heron chicks sampled
at a heronry near Davis, and birds taken under depredation
permits by aquiculture, pigeon, and vineyard bird removal
programs.

Birds were identified to species and aged using plumage
and/or skull ossification (Pyle 1997) and banded using ap-
propriate USGS bands (www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/). Some
species such as quail and pigeons were not provided federal
bands; these species were either not banded or banded with
non-USGS sequentially numbered plastic or aluminum bands
(National Band and Tag; Newport, NY). A 0.05 or 0.1 mL

blood sample (depending on bird size) was taken by jugular
venipuncture using a 0.5-mL tuberculin syringe with a 28 g
needle and immediately diluted with 0.9 mL saline; some
pigeons and doves were sampled from the brachial vein.
Birds recaptured on consecutive days were immediately re-
leased and not resampled.

Samples were clarified by centrifugation and then stored at
-20�C until screened for antibody by an enzyme immuno-
assay (EIA) using a conjugated anti-bird detector antibody
(Chiles and Reisen 1998, Ebel et al. 2002) produced com-
mercially in goats by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Mon-
tgomery, TX). Each sample was tested in three wells using a
96-well plate format—two wells with crude viral antigen and
one without antigen. Separate plates were precoated with
WEEV or SLEV antigen. Using this EIA, birds experimen-
tally infected with WNV or SLEV produced antibodies
equally reactive with our SLEV crude antigen (Fang and
Reisen 2006), so SLEV antigen was used to screen serum
samples for antibody against both flaviviruses. Samples with
the ratio of the mean absorbance of the two antigen-positive
wells divided by the antigen-negative well that were ‡ 2 were
confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
Samples were considered confirmed when endpoint titers on
Vero cell culture had >90% reduction of 75–100 plaque-
forming units (pfu) of WEEV, SLEV, or WNV at a dilution of
‡ 1:20. Because SLEV and WNV cross-reacted in our EIA
and PRNT assays (Fang and Reisen 2006, Patiris et al. 2008),
the purported infecting virus was required to produce an
endpoint titer ‡ 4· the competing virus. Positive bird sam-
ples were reported once and were limited to those birds with a
confirming PRNT90 titer ‡ 1:20 or ‡ 4· the competing virus.

Results

From 1996 through 2013, 54,546 individual birds com-
prising 151 species and 7 orders were banded, bled, and re-
leased, of which 142, 99, and 1929 individuals had serum
samples with neutralizing antibodies positive against WEEV,
SLEV, or WNV, respectively, at either initial capture or at
one or more recapture events (Table 2). Because the number
of samples required to detect a positive serum varied among
birds, data are presented as the number of individual birds
that were detected as positive among all birds sampled. An
additional 3732 birds from 137 species were bled, but not
banded, of which 16, 39, and 86 were positive for WEEV,
SLEV, or WNV, respectively (Table 3). These latter samples
came from birds that were not authorized for USGS bands

(quail, pigeons), were collected when USGS bands were not
available, or were collected for experimental or other pur-
poses. Because they were not banded, some of these birds
could have been sampled more than once, confounding at-
tempts to estimate prevalence of infection. Data from Tables 2
and 3 are combined in Figure 2 to show the temporal pattern of
seropositive bird collections at Coachella and Kern study sites.
Sample sizes reflected changes in landscape related to shore-
line changes of the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley and to the

flow of the Kern River in Kern County, as well as changes in
our staffing and collection methods (arrows show when mist
netting was terminated at each site). WEEV and SLEV anti-
bodies detected during 1996–2004 in Coachella disappeared
by 2005, two years after the initial detection of WNV in Ca-
lifornia (Fig. 1). Low-level activity of WEEV in Kern County
ended in 2001, was renewed briefly in 2005–2007, ended in
2008, and was not detected through 2013 in birds or by other
surveillance methods (Figs. 1 and 2); SLEV was not detected
in Kern County throughout the study period.

Sampling in Los Angeles and Yolo Counties was initiated
after the invasion of WNV, and neither WEEV nor SLEV
antibody-positive birds were detected at these locations,
agreeing with concurrent mosquito and sentinel chicken
surveillance. The relatively high proportion of recaptures at
these locations (Table 2) reflected the extensive use of grain-
baited traps and their attractiveness for passerines; for ex-
ample, one male House Sparrow was collected and bled 57
times over a 4-year period at the same trap in Los Angeles
(Kwan et al. 2012). Data from Los Angeles showed marked
temporal variation, with high seroprevalence associated with
outbreaks of WNV disease in humans during 2004, 2008, and
2012, when WNV seroprevalence increased to as high as
45% among after hatch-year and 60% among juvenile and
hatch-year House Finches and House Sparrows (Kwan et al.
2012). Peak WNV antibody positivity in Kern County during
2007 coincided with the largest outbreak of human disease in
this county since the arrival of WNV in 2004 (Reisen et al.
2009a). Interestingly, few human cases of mosquitoborne
encephalitis have been reported from Coachella Valley, de-
spite consistent enzootic transmission of all three viruses and
an elderly human population associated with several retire-
ment communities.

When sorted by resident status, >95% of seropositive birds
and >87% of recaptures were from species classified as year-
round residents (Table 4). The remaining positive birds were
winter residents that likely were infected during early or late
season transmission and summer residents that were infected
during the transmission season. Few transient migrants coming
north from Mexico or the Neotropics were seropositive,
agreeing with our previous study that focused on the role of
migratory birds in the movement of arboviruses through this
area (Reisen et al. 2010). Some of the species that traversed

through the Coachella Valley were summer residents in the
Central Valley, and 4 of these 592 birds were seropositive.
Overall, 15 of our captures were considered vagrants and were
collected outside of their normal ranges in North America
(<http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna>), including American Red-
start, Bay-breasted Warbler, Clay-colored Sparrow, Indigo
Bunting (2), Northern Waterthrush (4), Orchard Oriole,
Ovenbird, Ruddy Ground Dove, Tennessee Warbler, Virginia’s
Warbler, and Worm-eating Warbler (Table 2). Most vagrants
were captured in Coachella Valley and all were negative for
antibody.

Banded birds were summarized by order (Table 5). Overall,
85% of initial captures and 82% of recaptures were in the order
Passeriformes, followed by Columbiformes (mostly Mourning
Doves) and Galliformes (two species of Quail). Although these
latter two orders comprised <20% of the samples from original
and recaptured birds, they comprised 49% of the WEEV, 73%
of the SLEV, and 33% of the WNV seropositives, perhaps
indicating a trend for Culex vectors to blood feed on larger-
bodied birds. Adults of these columbiform and galliform birds
generally were low to moderately competent hosts based on
experimental infection studies (Komar et al. 2003, Reisen et al.
2003, 2005a); however, nestlings were highly competent before
their immune systems became fully functional (Mahmood et al.
2004, Reisen et al. 2006c). With the exception of House Finches
and House Sparrows, most of the seropositive Passeriformes
were fairly large-sized birds such as Western Scrub-Jays. Other
corvid species such as the American Crow and Yellow-billed
Magpie were infrequently collected and frequently succumbed
to WNV infection (Komar et al. 2003, Reisen et al. 2013b, Foss

et al. 2015), precluding their utility in serological surveys.
Another group frequently positive, but infrequently sampled,
was the Pelecaniformes, including the Least Bittern and Black-
crowned Night Heron. Some herons and egrets form large
multispecies nesting colonies during spring and early summer
that may be foci of intense virus transmission (Reisen et al.
2009b), provided these colonies did not form in trees over water
(Reisen et al. 2005b). Over land, Culex mosquitoes fed fre-
quently and preferentially on these birds (Thiemann et al.
2011), some of which such as Black-Crowned Night Herons
produced elevated WNV viremias as nestlings. Extensive sur-
veillance samples from sentinel or domestic chickens were not
included in this report, but serum samples from these birds
frequently were positive at all four study areas.

Of the 54,546 birds banded and released, only 128 were
reported to us as foreign encounters; that is, reported to the
USGS Bird Banding Laboratory by individuals from outside
of our research program. Of these, 90 were Mourning Doves,
of which 68 were reported as shot and 15 as found dead
during the hunting season and relatively near to where they
were banded and released. In addition, 12 Western Scrub-
Jays and 3 Yellow-billed Magpies were reported as found
dead. Five birds were reported from regions outside of Ca-
lifornia, including a Red-winged Blackbird banded in Ba-
kersfield in 1997 and reported from Alberta, Canada, in 2001,
a White-crowned Sparrow banded at the Tracy Ranch in Kern
County in 2003 and reported in British Columbia in 2005, a
Brown-headed Cowbird banded at the Kern NWR in 1997
and reported from Oregon in 2006, and a Western Wood
Pewee banded at the Kern NWR in 1997 and reported from
Nevada in 1999. In addition, a Common Yellowthroat banded
in Coachella Valley in 1997 was encountered in Santa Cruz
on the California Coast in 1999. Interestingly, we did not
document the movement of banded birds between our study
areas and made only a single foreign band recovery: a Brown-
headed Cowbird netted in Lamont near Bakersfield in No-
vember 2000 that was originally banded in the San Joaquin
Valley (data not available).

ANTIBODIES AGAINST ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES IN CALIFORNIA BIRDS 277



using standard metrics of human and equine passive case
detection and mosquito infection and sentinel chicken sero-
conversion, and confirmed the disappearance of both WEEV
and SLEV from California after 2008 and 2004, respectively,
through 2013. Conversely, WNV has remained active each
summer after its introduction in 2003, utilizing the same
mosquito vectors and generally the same avian hosts as
WEEV and SLEV. SLEV reappeared in Coachella Valley,
California, and Arizona during the summer of 2015 (un-
published data), but WEEV has not been detected to date.
Unfortunately bird sampling ceased in 2013, so the antibody
status of the avian community during the reemergence of
SLEV is not known.

It was difficult to understand these viral displacements.
Possibly very high viremia levels in susceptible avian hosts
and moderate Culex vector competence for WNV provided a
more effective transmission system than lower avian viremia
and greater vector competence by SLEV and WEEV (Hardy
and Reeves 1990b, 1990c, Reisen et al. 2005a, Maharaj et al.
2014). Although cross-immunity between SLEV and WNV
was demonstrated experimentally in avian hosts (Fang and
Reisen 2006, Patiris et al. 2008), SLEV seroprevalence levels
in Coachella Valley during 2002 and 2003 (Reisen et al.
2008b) apparently were inadequate to impede the invasion of
WNV in 2003 and then all of California by 2004. The es-
tablishment of WNV was followed by the immediate and
coincidental disappearance of SLEV from California and
most of North America (Reisen 2014). Previous infection
with WNV imparted sterilizing immunity against SLEV in
House Finches (Fang and Reisen 2006) and presumably other
birds, and this combined with more efficient WNV trans-
mission may have contributed to the disappearance of SLEV.

Coincidental with the invasion of WNV, WEEV also dis-
appeared from California and North America. WEEV is an
alphavirus and WNV is a flavivirus, and therefore there is no
cross-immunity. These two viruses utilize many of the same
avian hosts, but WEEV viremia was not impaired experi-
mentally by WNV infection when birds were coinfected with
both viruses (Reisen and Hahn 2007). Previously, Reeves
et al. (1994) speculated that WEEV may disappear due to
global climate warming. In support, the median infectious
dose of WEEV required to infect field-collected Culex tar-
salis was found to increase by two to three orders of mag-
nitude from early spring to midsummer (Hardy et al. 1990a,
Reisen et al. 1996b), perhaps indicating the negative impact
of warm temperature on susceptibility to infection. However,
the last location of active WEEV transmission in California
was in the SE deserts, the hottest area of California, where
temperatures average 3–5�C warmer than the San Joaquin
Valley where WEEV was previously endemic (Reisen et al.
2006b). In addition, WEEV replicates more effectively in
mosquitoes at cold temperatures than does WNV (Reisen
et al. 1993, 2006b), thereby theoretically extending the
transmission season. Previously, it was proposed that flood-
water Aedes mosquitoes and mammals (especially Lago-
morphs) composed an early season transmission cycle for
WEEV that preceded the well-documented Culex–bird cycle
(Burton et al. 1966, McLintock et al. 1970). However, our
studies in southern California did not support this paradigm
as few Aedes were found infected (Reisen 1984, Reisen et al.
1990, 1992a). In addition, we have failed to detect temporal
declines in WEEV replicative fitness as indicated by exper-

imental infections in mosquito or passerine hosts (Reisen
et al. 2008a) or mosquito and avian cell culture systems
(Zhang et al. 2011). Decreased murine neurovirulence was
reported for one WEEV strain (IMP181-05) isolated from
Imperial County, California, in 2005 (Logue et al. 2009).

The arrival of WNV in California was accompanied by
marked wildlife, veterinary, and human health impacts that
raised media attention and funding levels for surveillance and
mosquito control at the local and national levels. In combi-
nation with several drought years during which cropping
strategies were altered and irrigation practices modified to
increase water-use efficiency, enhanced mosquito control
perhaps reduced vector abundance below the entomological
thresholds required for efficient avian infection and the am-
plification of WEEV and SLEV, but not WNV.

Avian host selection

The presence of antibodies against arboviruses in avian
hosts depends largely upon the host selection patterns of the
mosquito vectors and the ability of the avian host to survive
infection and produce detectable and persistent antibodies.
Although Cx. tarsalis fed more frequently upon mammals than
did members of the Cx. pipiens complex, both vectors blood
fed frequently upon a wide variety of birds (Tempelis et al.
1965, Tempelis and Washino 1967, Molaei et al. 2010,
Montgomery et al. 2011, Thiemann et al. 2011, 2012, Camp-
bell et al. 2013, Reisen et al. 2013a). Related behavioral studies
showed the importance of vegetative ecotones, landscape
heterogeneity and composition, and mosquito flight paths
during host-seeking flights on the frequency of vector–host
contact (Lothrop and Reisen 2001).

A striking example of the importance of landscape was the
near absence of pelecaniform bloodmeals from Culex
(Thiemann et al. 2012) or antibody in ardeid birds (Reisen
et al. 2005b) collected in southern California, where these
and other waterbirds such as gulls and cormorants nested and
roosted in snags over water or on sand bars. When the same
ardeid species nested in trees over land near Davis in the
Central Valley, they were frequently infected with WNV
(Reisen et al. 2009b) and were the preferred bloodmeal host
for Culex (Thiemann et al. 2011).

Based on the current serological data, previous bloodmeal
analyses, and dead bird surveillance (Foss et al. 2015), larger
birds such as doves, quail, and domestic chickens seemed to
be selected more frequently than smaller birds such as war-
blers and wrens. This agreed with the general overselection of
thrushes (family Turdidae) by Culex in eastern United States
(Kilpatrick 2011) and Europe (Lundstrom et al. 2001). Adult
galliform and columbiform birds generally are poor to
moderately competent hosts for WNV (Reisen et al. 2003,
2005a, Wheeler et al. 2009), and along with mammals, their
frequent selection by host-seeking mosquitoes most likely
dampened virus transmission. Conversely, the corvids (es-
pecially American Crows) present an interesting conundrum
because they are large-bodied periurban birds, are highly
competent for North American strains of WNV and usually
die from infection (Komar et al. 2003, Brault et al. 2004), and
are frequently associated epidemiologically in time and space
with the transmission of WNV to humans (Eidson et al. 2001,
Reisen et al. 2006a, Nielsen and Reisen 2007), but seemed to
be infrequently fed upon by Culex (Molaei et al. 2010,

278 REISEN AND WHEELER



Thiemann et al. 2012), except under certain conditions of
host availability (Thiemann et al. 2011, Campbell et al.
2013). With the exception of Western Scrub-Jays, the high
mortality rate among infected corvids and their difficulty
in collection made them unsuited for routine serological
sampling. House Finches, House Sparrows, and perhaps
Oak Titmice seemed to be outliers to this general trend in
bird size, because although they are relatively small-sized
birds, they frequently were fed upon by Culex (Thiemann
et al. 2012), were frequently antibody positive in ser-
osurveys (current and historical studies), produced viremias
adequate to infect Culex (Reisen et al. 2005a, 2006b), were
linked closely to viral amplification and outbreak patterns in
urban settings (Kwan et al. 2012), and frequently tested
positive at necropsy when found dead in nature (Foss et al.
2015).

Sampling biases

Although avian serology may be informative and compli-
ment other surveillance measures such as infection prevalence
in dead birds for tracking arbovirus activity, our sampling
approach and the resulting data had multiple limitations and
biases. The diversity of species collected and therefore tested
was constrained by sampling. Based on historical studies, we
chose to focus on mist netting and grain-baited trap collections
that worked well for passeriform, galliform, and some co-
lumbiform birds; however, these methods did not collect all
species equally and often birds seen within our study areas
were rarely collected, making us reluctant to use the numbers
captured as an index of abundance.

In addition, these methods did not collect potentially im-
portant bird groups such as the psittaforms, anseriforms, and
pelecaniforms. Many cities in California now have large
resident populations of escaped psittaform birds, and New
World species have been found to be highly susceptible to
WNV infection (Komar 2003), but with the exception of an
occasional Budgerigar, these birds were never collected by
our sampling program. The role of anseriform birds in ar-
bovirus amplification remains poorly understood. Although
adult mallard ducks were relatively refractory to WEEV and
SLEV (low viremia response), 6-day-old ducklings produced
peak viremias of 3.3 to 4.3 pfu/mL and 4.4 to 6.7 pfu/mL
following needle inoculation with Kern County strains of
WEEV and SLEV, respectively, and produced a strong an-
tibody response (unpublished data). Adult mallards infected
with WNV produced a peak viremia of 6.7 pfu/mL; ducklings
were not tested (Komar et al. 2003). Our few blood samples
from anersiforms were taken from birds collected for other
purposes and none were antibody positive. Repeated sam-
pling at a heronry consisting of nesting Black-crowned Night
Herons, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, and Cattle Egrets
showed frequent infection of nestlings that had fallen from
nests, with elevated viremia and high antibody prevalence
(Reisen et al. 2009b), but adult birds in the canopy could not
be sampled.

Another sampling problem precluding the estimation of
prevalence was that individual birds were sampled on different
numbers of occasions. This created variation in the sensitivity
of detection of infection among birds within and among spe-
cies. Obviously birds collected on multiple occasions over
several transmission seasons would have a greater probability

of being detected as antibody positive than birds collected once
in a single occasion. In agreement, after hatch-year birds had a
higher prevalence of infection than hatch-year birds.

In addition to biases related to avian species sampling, our
data also were limited to those species or individuals that
became infected and survived to produce antibody and
therefore may not represent infection prevalence. Although
most species survive WEEV and SLEV infection (Reisen
et al. 2003), many species succumb to WNV infection (Ko-
mar et al. 2003, Reisen et al. 2005a, Wheeler et al. 2009).
Because the mortality rate from WNV infection varied
widely within and among avian species, this contributed to
the difficulty in calculating and interpreting seroprevalence
data. Therefore, to appreciate the range of avian involvement
in WNV transmission, the current study should be compared
with the results of concurrent dead bird surveillance (Foss
et al. 2015) as well as experimental host competence studies
(Wheeler et al. 2009).

Data from foreign recapture encounters were unrewarding.
Our sole foreign encounter was a single Brown-headed
Cowbird. In addition, we did not encounter banded birds
moving among our four study areas, even during migration
periods. For example, we banded and released 7294 White-
crowned Sparrows and recaptured 2788 that we banded. This
winter resident arrived at our study areas during fall and
departed in spring, thereby avoiding most of the virus
transmission season, although some were found antibody
positive for WNV. Many of the birds we collected in the San
Joaquin Valley purportedly nest in Alaska (Hardy et al.
1965), a journey of over 3000 miles each way. However, they
returned each fall to the exact same wintering grounds, and
banded birds were never recaptured at different sampling
sites. Most foreign encounters of our banded birds were by
hunters during dove season: 83 of 90 encounters of Mourning
Doves were shot or found dead. Overall, 12 of 12 Western
Scrub-Jay reports were from dead birds that may have suc-
cumbed from WNV, but were not submitted for testing. Only
five birds were reported from outside of our region. These
data certainly indicated the difficulty in understanding bird
migration routes and survival, and the low frequency of band
encounters along the Pacific Flyway.

Relatively few bird species were repeatedly positive for
antibodies against these three arboviruses. We sampled 152
different species of birds; however, 83% of the positive indi-
viduals were from 5 key species. From a WNV epidemiolog-
ical standpoint, information on cumulative seroprevalence
among two peridomestic maintenance hosts (House Finches,
House Sparrows) sampled by grain-baited traps seemed most
informative. In Los Angeles, when herd immunity or the
proportion of antibody-positive birds collected during Janu-
ary–March was >20%, the probability of a summer outbreak of
human disease was low (Kwan et al. 2012), and these data now
are used for early season planning by local mosquito control
agencies. In contrast, our attempts to establish similar trapping
programs at our Kern County and Coachella Valley study areas
were less successful because we failed to establish high trap
collection success and trap fidelity (Fig. 2), and seroprevalence
rates in these species generally were not predictive of virus
amplification (Reisen et al. 2008b, 2009a). Passive surveil-
lance using dead birds reported by the public seemed to be a
more cost-effective and efficient method of monitoring WNV
activity (Foss et al. 2015).

ANTIBODIES AGAINST ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES IN CALIFORNIA BIRDS 279



The intensive and widespread enzootic transmission of
WNV to birds and improved genetic methods of bloodmeal
host identification provided a more extensive appreciation of
encephalitis virus transmission patterns in California than
could be extracted from studies when there was low-level
activity of WEEV and SLEV. Although these viruses occa-
sionally infected a wide range of avian hosts, only a few
species seemed critical for maintaining transmission, and the
simplification of diversity in periurban landscapes allowed
effective virus amplification to outbreak levels. As suggested
previously (Reeves and Hammon 1962), key avian species
were abundant and widespread during the summer trans-
mission season in habitats frequented by questing Culex,
frequently survived infection, produced elevated viremias
following infection with small amounts of virus, had a high
reproductive or replacement rate ensuring a continued num-
ber of immunologically naı̈ve birds, and were fed upon
frequently by Culex vector species. In California, House
Finches, House Sparrows, and Western Scrub-Jays seemed to
best fit these criteria, although comparable adequate data
were not available on all other possible species.

ABSTRACT

Ninety percent (56/62) of sentinel chickens introduced to two regions within the Italian Alps seroconverted to West
Nile virus (WNV) during the summer of 2005, showing a range of antibody titres from 1/20 to 1/320 in a virus neu-
tralization test. Neutralization specificity for WNV antibodies was confirmed on an additional 34 sera that were
tested in parallel against WNV (16/34 seropositivity), Usutu virus (3/34 seropositivity) and Koutango virus. The
geometric mean neutralizing titre (GMT) calculated for WN-specific antibodies was 33.68 and did not differ sig-
nificantly amongst sample sites, although the overall results indicate more active circulation of WNV at the higher
elevations. Such high levels of seroconversion raise the possibility that many chickens may have been exposed to
virus via routes other than mosquito transmission. No chickens or any other local animals were associated with
illness due to WNV implying that WNV, and to a much lower extent Usutu virus, circulate harmlessly amongst
wildlife species in northern Italy from late May onwards until early autumn. Key Words: West Nile—Epidemi-
ology—Transmission—Field studies. Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Dis. 7, 411–417.

INTRODUCTION

WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV) is one of the mostwidespread of the flaviviruses, with a ge-
ographic distribution that includes Africa, Eu-
rope, Eurasia, Australasia, North and South
America and the Caribbean islands. The virus
is carried to Europe by birds that migrate be-
tween Africa, Asia and Europe. It is transmit-
ted to non-migratory resident birds and mam-
malian hosts by ornithophilic mosquitoes such
as Culex spp. (Hubalek and Halouzka 1999,
Malkinson and Banet 2002, Gould et al. 2001,
Buckley et al. 2003). Although WNV has been
shown to be pathogenic for humans and a wide
range of mammalian and bird species (Mc-
Clean et al. 2002), in the Old World it appears
to circulate relatively harmlessly, as demon-
strated by the detection of antibodies in a num-
ber of healthy avian species (Gould et al. 2006,

Buckley et al. 2006). However, outbreaks of
West Nile fever have been recorded in several
European and Mediterranean countries during
the last decades, including Romania, Russia, Is-
rael and Italy (Murgue et al. 2002, Autorino et
al. 2002). The introduction of WNV to North
America in 1999 (Jia et al. 1999, Lanciotti et al.
1999, Roehrig et al. 2002) led to widespread epi-
demics that currently do not appear to be re-
ceding in intensity. Despite the enormous num-
ber of publications on WNV epidemiology,
relatively little is known of the ecology and nat-
ural history of WNV transmission in Europe,
and most WNV outbreaks in humans and ani-
mals remain unpredictable and difficult to con-
trol (Dauphin et al. 2005). The unexpected ap-
pearance of Usutu virus (USUV) causing fatal
infections in birds in Austria in 2000 (Weis-
senbock et al. 2001) and the occasional cases of
WNV in horses in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002)

and France (Durand et al. 2002) have increased
our awareness of emerging arbovirus patho-
gens in Europe. Thus, early detection of virus
activity in animals, and analysis of the ecolog-
ical conditions that characterise WNV-active
geographic regions would be useful to devise
disease monitoring and early warning systems.

The Trentino-Alto Adige region of northern
Italy is located under one of the important bird
migratory routes across the Alps between
Africa and Europe. To assess whether or not
WNV circulates in this area and the period of
its major activity, we monitored WNV-specific
seroconversion in sentinel chickens placed on
open ground during the summer of 2005. The
use of sentinel chickens is known to be a cost-
effective and non-invasive alternative to the
use of wildlife species for detecting WNV cir-
culation (Buckley et al. 2006) and is used fre-
quently throughout North America to monitor
the presence of this virus.

METHODS

Fifty-two hand-reared 2-week-old chicks
were placed in two different fenced open areas
with other farm birds on May 4 until August
28, 2005. Fourteen of these chicks were lost by
predation during the sampling period. Serum
was collected fortnightly from each chicken; it
was clarified by centrifugation and stored at
�20°C. One site was located in Fiemme Valley
(Tesero, altitude 997 m above sea level) a
mountainous area of the Dolomites where the
mean annual temperature is 7.65°C, and the to-
tal annual rainfall is 688.6 mm (Fig. 1). The sec-
ond site (Pietramurata, altitude 549 m above
sea level) was located in the Lake Valley dis-
trict, an area characterized by the presence of
lakes, with a mean annual temperature during
2005 of 9.88°C and a total annual rainfall of
854.2 mm. An additional 10 chicks were placed
in Cavedine, located near Pietramurata site, on
June 21, 2005. Serum samples were tested for
the presence of antibodies to an African strain
of WNV (WN-DAK) using the 50% plaque re-
duction neutralization test (PRNT50) described
previously (Buckley et al. 2003, 2006). All
plaque reduction tests were performed blind;
the sera were numbered in Italy with no indi-

cation of their identity and they were tested in
Oxford, UK. The results were subsequently de-
coded in Italy.

The number of seroconverting sentinel chick-
ens (i.e., with a titer � 1/20) was estimated at
fortnightly intervals. The geometric mean anti-
body titer (GMT) was calculated for PRNT50
as described in Thrusfield (2005). To confirm
WNV antibody specificity, the sera of an addi-
tional 34 adult chickens kept on the same farms
and having similar exposure to mosquitoes and
migratory birds during the years 2005 and 2006
were collected during August 2006. These sera
were multi-tested using PRNT50 against the lin-
eage 1 (WN-DAK) strain of WNV (Lanciotti et
al. 2002) and closely related Usutu virus
(USUV) and Koutango virus (KOUV).

Statistical analysis

To assess differences in titers among sites, we
performed a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA).

RESULTS

Table 1 presents a summary of the PRNT50
results obtained from the 62 sentinel chickens
that were monitored fortnightly on three sites
of the Province of Trento during 2005.

The individual volumes of serum from May
4, 2005 through June 28, 2005 were too small
for analysis at a 1/10 dilution. Therefore, the
data are expressed with the lowest positive titre
being 1/20. However, in the older chickens the
volumes of sera were slightly larger and could
be titrated from 1/10 dilution. Thus, all posi-
tive results, i.e., including those from 1/10 di-
lution, are presented in Table 1. Of the original
52 chicks that were placed in May on the farms
of Tesero and Pietramurata, 47 (90%) individ-
uals seroconverted to WNV showing an anti-
body titer of at least 1/20, and in many cases,
the titers increased during the period of expo-
sure. The GMT recorded at these sites was re-
spectively 35.25 in Tesero and 31.46 in Pietra-
murata.

Eleven of 52 chicks that had been kept in-
doors until they were 2 weeks old were already
seropositive for WNV before being released

outdoors (Table 1), presumably indicating the
presence of antibodies transferred maternally
to the chicks through the egg (Rose et al. 1974).

However, 2 weeks later, eight of these chicks
showed an antibody titer of �1/20, while nine
new seroconversions (�1/20) were recorded,
implying exposure to WNV.

The number of seroconversions increased
significantly during May and then continued
to increase more gradually until the end of July
(Fig. 2).

The additional 10 chickens that were placed
outdoors at Cavedine on June 14, 2005 sero-
converted within 2 weeks from 10% (1/10) on
June 21 to 100% (10/10), with titers ranging
from 1/20 to 1/160. All of these sera remained
positive with gradual increases in titer for the
remaining period of observation and with a
GMT of 32.62.

In order to increase the stringency of the tests
and thereby to detect stronger immune re-
sponses, the positive PRNT50 samples were re-
calculated using a 90% plaque reduction end-
point. The Tesero samples recorded 5/26
PRNT90 positive samples with titers of 1/20 on
June 29, 2005 and 8/25 positive samples on July
13, 2005 with titers ranging from 1/10 to 1/40.
Prior to June 29, 2005, no samples from any of
the sites recorded PRNT90 positive samples.

These results appear to suggest that Tesero
showed greater viral activity than Pietramu-
rata. However, the comparison of the GMT us-
ing PRNT50 titers did not differ statistically
(F(2,271) � 1.28; p � 0.27). The more stringent
tests demonstrate that, during the period of
major seroconversion (May to late July), im-
mune responses in some chickens were equiv-
alent to those that would be expected in ani-
mals that presented with clinical symptoms.
However, it is known that, although chickens
respond immunologically to infectious WNV,
they do not succumb to disease caused by this
virus (Komar 2003).

Of the 34 additional sera multi-tested for
West Nile virus (WN-DAK), Usutu virus
(USUV), and Koutango virus, 16/34 produced
positive WN virus results but only 3/34 were
positive for USUV, of which two were negative
for WNV. These combined observations con-
firm the specificity of the test for WNV or a
very closely related virus. The third serum had
a high titer (1:80) against USUV, a slightly
lower titer against WNV, and a low titer against
KOUV. This is almost certainly an example of
antigenic cross-reactivity because of the higher
titer. Two sera showed low antibody titers
(1/10) for KOUV, but were negative against
WNV and USUV. We conclude that these tests

demonstrate the specificity of the PRNT50 test
for WNV, and they also demonstrate that
USUV and KOUV or very closely related
viruses (possibly variants of WNV) circulate
much less successfully in this region of Italy.

DISCUSSION

WNV causes human epidemics and is also
known to circulate amongst a wide range of
wildlife species in Russia (Lvov et al. 2004) and
the Czech Republic (Ernek et al. 1977, Barkonyi
et al. 2005, Hubalek and Halouzka 1999). More-
over, a variety of strains of the virus have been
isolated several times in these countries. Ro-
mania suffered a significant human epidemic
outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1996 and
further outbreaks in 1997 and 1998 (Savage et
al. 1999, Cernescu et al. 2000). Nevertheless, de-
spite these epidemics in central Europe, and al-
though there have been sporadic cases of WNV
infection in wildlife species, in general this
virus has not caused significant human epi-
demic outbreaks in western European coun-
tries. Thus, WNV is not considered to present
a major epidemic threat to humans in this area
of Europe. Occasional cases of neurological dis-
ease due to WNV have been recorded in horses
in Italy (Autorino et al. 2002) and in the Ca-
margue region of France (Durand et al. 2002),
and serological evidence of the presence of a

WNV-related virus has been obtained in many
other parts of Europe (Buckley et al. 2003, Mur-
gue et al. 2002). Thus, there is concern that
WNV has the potential to cause human epi-
demic outbreaks in Europe, but at this time, we
have no clear understanding of the underlying
ecological and epidemiological basis for WNV
epidemicity.

The data presented in this brief study are
based on the plaque reduction neutralization
test which is more discriminating than other
serological tests following primary immuno-
logical responses (Burke and Monath 2001).
The results obtained by testing in parallel the
sera of adult chickens, exposed for at least two
subsequent years to mosquitos bites or to con-
tact with migratory birds, clearly indicate that
the neutralization results are highly specific
and can discriminate between antibodies due
to exposure to different flaviviruses which may
circulate in the same geographic area.

The PRNT results presented in this study
therefore show clearly that WNV, or a very
closely related virus, and to a lesser extent
USUV, are transmitted to sentinel chickens and
presumably to other outdoor animals or hu-
mans in Northern Italy, despite the fact that
there are no records of recognized neurologi-
cal disease due to these viruses in humans, an-
imals or birds. It is presumed that WNV is 
being introduced annually from warmer coun-
tries such as Africa by migratory birds that in
part overfly and, in part, reproduce in the re-
gions where this study was carried out. Ac-
cording to the sentinel chicken survey, efficient
virus transmission between, or to chickens, ap-
pears to commence in late spring and contin-
ues during the summer period. Whilst the pres-
ence of mosquitoes such as Aedes spp, Anopheles
spp. Culex spp, Coquillettidia spp and Culiseta
spp. is recognized in this part of Italy (Ferrarese
1994), the high efficiency with which the virus
appears to be transmitted to the chicken pop-

to arthropod transmission, such as fecal and/or
oral transmission (Banet-Noach et al. 2003, Ko-

to transmission efficiency. In addition, non-

et al. 2005), might also increase the efficiency
of WNV transmission.

An obvious question arises from these sen-
tinel experiments: Why is there no disease in
animals and birds in Northern Italy? First, one
possibility is that the strains of WNV that cir-
culate silently in western Europe are naturally
sylvatic in Africa; that is, these viruses might
correspond to the lineage II clade of viruses de-
fined by Lanciotti et al. (1999). Second, these
sylvatic viruses are not considered to be highly
virulent for mammalian species, presumably
because they have evolved with vertebrate
species over a long period of time in Africa.
Third, the low virulence could reflect genetic
resistance that has evolved in European species
as the viruses have been introduced annually
from Africa. Fourth, mosquito density and/or
vector competence may rarely reach suffi-
ciently high levels amongst human populations
in northern Italy, and presumably other more
northerly parts of western Europe, to effect an
epidemic outbreak of WN fever or encephali-
tis. It is believed that the epidemics in Roma-
nia in 1996 and in Russia during the beginning
of the new millenium arose largely because of
the climatic conditions that ensured high mos-
quito densities and high virus transmission ef-
ficiency (Roehrig et al. 2002).

In conclusion, this preliminary investigation
indicates that WNV or a very closely related
virus is introduced into northern Italy, pre-
sumably annually, by migratory birds from
Africa under a variety of different ecological
conditions that characterise the alpine envi-
ronment, ie ranging from the lower, warmer
and wetter valleys to higher altitudes where the
density of potential vector mosquitoes is ex-
pected to be lower. The gradually increasing
antibody titers and proportions of positive sen-
tinel chickens through the summer months im-
ply that, once introduced into a region, the
virus is then able to circulate efficiently
amongst the resident populations. Our obser-
vations support and extend the findings of oth-
ers that, although mosquitoes are known to be
important vectors in disease transmission,
other modes of transmission such as fecal, oral,
and aerosol may also be important in the trans-
mission of WNV (Nir et al. 1965, Komar et al.

2003). Discrimination between these different
transmission routes could be addressed in fu-
ture studies using sentinel chickens in individ-
ually fenced open areas to avoid chick-to-chick
infection.

Clearly, we now need to understand why in
most cases WNV can disperse very successfully
without causing overt disease, but on other oc-
casions its introduction to a region can lead to
major epidemic outbreaks.

Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), is an

encephalitogenic arbovirus broadly distributed in the Americas. Phylogenetic analysis based on

the full-length E gene sequences obtained for 30 Brazilian SLEV strains was performed using

different methods including Bayesian and relaxed molecular clock approaches. A new genetic

lineage was suggested, hereafter named genotype VIII, which co-circulates with the previously

described genotype V in the Brazilian Amazon region. Genotypes II and III were restricted to São

Paulo state (South-east Atlantic rainforest ecosystem). The analysis also suggested the

emergence of an SLEV common ancestor between 1875 and 1973 (mean of 107 years ago),

giving rise to two major genetic groups: genotype II, more prevalent in the North America, and a

second group comprising the other genotypes (I and III–VIII), broadly dispersed throughout the

Americas, suggesting that SLEV initially emerged in South America and spread to North America.

In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the high genetic variability of SLEV and its

geographical dispersion in Brazil and other New World countries.

INTRODUCTION

Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is an encephalito-
genic arbovirus with a primary life cycle associated with
Culex mosquitoes and wild birds (Travassos da Rosa et al.,
1997; Vasconcelos et al., 1998; Reisen, 2003). Taxonom-
ically, Saint Louis encephalitis virus is a recognized species
of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and belongs to
the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) group, which includes
other important human pathogens such as West Nile virus
(WNV), JEV and Murray Valley encephalitis virus
(Calisher & Gould, 2003).

SLEV is widely distributed throughout the western hemi-
sphere from Canada to Argentina. SLEV was first isolated
in 1933 during a major epidemic that occurred in St Louis,
Missouri, USA, with more than 1000 encephalitis cases
reported. Outbreaks or clusters of encephalitis cases

associated with SLEV have been reported annually in the
USA (Reisen, 2003). Usually, the fatality rate ranges from 5
to 20 % (Tsai & Mitchell, 1988), with higher mortality rates
observed among the elderly (.75 years of age) (Reisen,
2003).

The low number of human cases reported in tropical
regions of the Americas may reflect inadequate laboratory
diagnosis, circulation of less virulent virus strains and/or
enzootic cycles involving mosquitoes that are not typically
anthropophilic (Spense, 1980). Only three SLEV strains
have been isolated from humans in Brazil. Two patients
resident in Para state had clinical manifestations char-
acterized by fever and jaundice (Pinheiro et al., 1981;
Vasconcelos et al., 1998), whilst one from São Paulo was
suspected of dengue-like disease (Rocco et al., 2005). None
of them had neurological symptoms. Recently, the SLEV
genome was detected by RT-PCR in four patients with
clinical symptoms similar to those observed in dengue
fever, as well as in two other patients clinically diagnosed as
presenting with viral meningoencephalitis, in the muni-
cipality of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, south-eastern
Brazil (Mondini et al., 2007a, b).

The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the SLEV E gene
sequences determined in this study are GU808530–GU808559.

Details of the SLEV strains included in the phylogenetic analysis are

In Brazil, several SLEV strains have been obtained from
wild birds, especially from those belonging to the family
Formicariidae (Dégallier et al., 1992), and also from Culex
mosquitoes. Furthermore, many strains have been isolated
from Culex declarator and Culex coronator mosquitoes,
both predominantly ornithophilic but also able to infect
primates and considered potential SLEV vectors in the
Brazilian Amazon (Travassos da Rosa et al., 1985; Hervé
et al., 1986; Vasconcelos et al., 1991).

Other potential vectors, including species belonging to the
genera Aedes, Mansonia and Sabethes, can become infected
and transmit SLEV to other vertebrate hosts. Thus,
secondary cycles certainly exist on different forest levels,
resulting in the participation of other animals in the cycle,
including rodents and marsupials on the ground and non-
human primates in the canopy (Hervé et al., 1986).
Moreover, a serological survey performed on equines from
the Brazilian Amazon and Pantanal areas revealed a high
prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (50.9 %) to SLEV
(Rodrigues et al., 2009).

Previous phylogenetic studies based on complete nucleo-
tide sequences of the envelope gene (E) (Kramer &
Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003; May et al.,
2008; Auguste et al., 2009; Ottendorfer et al., 2009) and the
ORF (10 236 nt) (Baillie et al., 2008) of SLEV strains have
revealed the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas.
However, there is no consensus in terms of number of
SLEV genetic lineages and sublineages.

Most SLEV strains have been grouped geographically
(Kramer & Chandler, 2001), suggesting that SLEV is pre-
dominantly maintained in a particular area. However,
some strains have occasionally been transported between
areas within and outside the USA (Kramer et al., 1997;
Kramer & Chandler, 2001). There is no evidence of a
correlation between phylogenetic grouping (based on the
nucleotide sequence of the E gene) and phenotypic
characteristics (such as virulence) (Kramer et al., 1997).
In those analyses, the SLEV strains from the Brazilian
Amazon were classified as genotype V (subgenotypes VA
and VB), whilst isolates from south-eastern Brazil (São
Paulo state) were classified as genotypes II and III.

In this study, we examined the molecular epidemiology of
SLEV, including the genetic diversity and dispersal of
SLEV, through phylogenetic analysis based on the complete
nucleotide sequence of the E gene of 30 SLEV strains
isolated in the Brazilian Amazon that had not previously
been studied.

RESULTS

The nucleotide sequence divergence between groups was
assessed and determined as 6.3±0.4 % (mean±SD). The
mean within-group genetic divergence was estimated at 4 %
ranging from 3.2 % for genotype II to 4.7 % for genotype IV,
and the confidence value (CV) was determined as 5.1 %.

Phylogenetic trees constructed by neighbour-joining (NJ),
maximum-parsimony (MP), maximum-likelihood (ML)
and Bayesian methods revealed similar topologies. All
methods generated trees with a similar topology; thus, we
used the ML and Bayesian reconstructions, which presented
higher bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability values,
respectively, to represent the final topology. The phylogeny
depicted all SLEV strains divided into eight phylogenetic
groups: groups I–VII corresponding to previously described
genotypes (Kramer & Chandler, 2001) and a distinct group,
hereafter designated genotype VIII. Phylogenetic groups
were determined using the association of bootstrap
(.75 %), posterior probability (.0.9) and CV (5.1 %) as
the criteria established for group inclusion or exclusion.

Fourteen out of 37 strains (37.8 %) isolated in the Brazilian
Amazon region were identified as genotype VIII, and 23
(62.2 %) as genotype V (Fig. 1). Seven strains isolated in
Pará state were classified as subgenotype VIIIA. One strain
isolated in Mato Grosso state was classified as subgenotype
VIIIB together with six other isolates from Pará state
(Fig. 1). For genotype V, nine isolates (eight from Pará
state and one from Rondônia) were grouped in the VA
subgenotype, whilst seven isolates from Pará were included
in the VB subgenotype.

To investigate the divergence time among SLEV strains in
the Americas, we used a time-scaled analysis based on
evolutionary rates estimated using the Bayesian coalescent
method (Fig. 1). The nucleotide substitution rate for all
analysed strains ranged from 3.961024 to 7.761024

substitutions per site per year (mean of 4.961024

substitutions per site per year).

The time of emergence of the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) for SLEV in the Americas [(expressed as the 95 %
highest posterior density (HPD)] was estimated to have
occurred between 1875 and 1973 (mean 1898). For genotype
II, a common parental virus emerged between 1898 and
1930 (mean 1920). For the group including genotypes I and
III–VIII, a common virus ancestor emerged between 1893
and 1942 (mean 1915). The time of emergence for each
genotype was estimated as follows: genotype I, between 1924
and 1951 (mean 1932); genotype V between 1944 and 1952
(mean 1948); genotype VIII, between 1956 and 1966 (mean
1959); genotype VI between 1946 and 1969 (mean 1949);
genotype VII between 1962 and 1965 (mean 1964); genotype
IV between 1962 and 1968 (mean 1966); and genotype III
between 1967 and 1979 (mean 1971) (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION

Previous studies on comparative phylogenetic analysis have
demonstrated the genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas
(Kramer & Chandler, 2001; Twiddy & Holmes, 2003;
Baillie et al., 2008; May et al., 2008; Auguste et al., 2009;
Ottendorfer et al., 2009), but there is disagreement among
authors regarding the classification of certain strains into
lineages and sublineages.

Our comparative and chronological phylogenetic analysis
carried out using full-length E gene sequences for 133 SLEV
strains, 30 of them sequenced in this study, identified the
presence of the seven genotypes reported by Kramer &
Chandler (2001), as well as 14 strains within a new
genotype, designated genotype VIII (Fig. 1).

The results obtained by the molecular clock analysis
suggested that SLEV is a relatively new flavivirus in
comparison with other flaviviruses that are transmitted
by mosquitoes, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus
(Zanotto et al., 1995, 1996; Bryant et al., 2007), as its
evolutionary history was dated between 1875 and 1973
(mean 1898). The analysis conducted by Auguste et al.
(2009), which included 73 SLEV strains, indicated SLEV
dispersal from South America towards North America and
is in agreement with the current chronological analysis of
the 133 SLEVs performed in this study (Fig. 1). In fact, the
current analysis suggests evolutionary events that occurred
almost simultaneously in both hemispheres (North
America: 77–108 years ago; South America: 72–121 years
ago) through the introduction of a given progenitor (geno-
type common ancestor), leading to the emergence and
geographical dispersal of distinct phylogenetic lineages in
North and South America along the time line.

These two ancestral groups are mainly represented by: (i)
genotype II, which was almost entirely restricted to North
America and included the strains isolated during major
SLEV epidemics in North America between 1933 and 2003;
and (ii) the other genotypes I and III–VIII, which were
more widely distributed and responsible for outbreaks,
epizootics and/or enzootic transmission during the same
period of time in various countries in South America
(Argentina, Brazil and Peru), Central America (Guatemala
and Panama) and the Caribbean (Jamaica and Trinidad
and Tobago), as well as in the USA (Fig. 1).

Genotypes V and VIII were more prevalent in Brazil and,
according to the analysis using the relaxed molecular clock
method, these genotypes evolved from a common ancestor
between 1937 and 1950, segregating with time into two
distinct subgenotypes that emerged in almost the same
period (Fig. 1). High Bayesian posterior probabilities
(BPPs) support the designation of SLEV genotype VIII
(1.0), as well as the subgenotypes VIIIA (0.97) and VIIIB
(0.92). The genotype VIII phylogenetic group was also
supported by its within-group genetic divergence (3.9 %),

which was less than the CV (5.1 %) used as a criterion for
group inclusion or exclusion (Fig. 1).

Genotype VIII was restricted to the Pará state in the
northern Amazon region, whilst genotype V was widely
distributed in the Americas, with strains isolated in
Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago, which
were grouped in subgenotype VA, and USA strains, which
were grouped in subgenotype VB. Based on our analysis,
the MRCA for subgenotype VA emerged between 1948 and
1955 (mean 1953) and is more closely related to a Trinidad
and Tobago strain, following a dispersion pattern in the
Brazilian Amazon from east to west in different muni-
cipalities of Pará (Altamira, Belém, Faro, Itaituba,
Medicilândia, Oriximiná, Santarém and Tucurui) and the
Rondônia states (Jamari) (Fig. 2). The prevalence of
subgenotype VA in the 1980s was higher than that observed
for subgenotype VB, being subsequently detected over the
time in Tucuruı́ (1990) and Medicilândia (2002) in Pará
state (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the SLEV strains from Cali-
fornia (1998–2001) and Texas (2002) identified as geno-
type V were closely related to the strain from Medicilândia
isolated in 2002 (BRA-02) (Fig. 1), suggesting an intense
traffic of SLEV through the two American subcontinents,
probably by migratory birds.

SLEV strains identified as genotype VB were isolated in the
1960s and 1970s from wild birds and mosquitoes or
sentinel animals at a surveillance site for arboviruses placed
in a forested area near Belém, the capital of Pará state
(Table 1, Fig. 2). The circulation of SLEV in the 1970s was
associated with isolation of the BRA-78 strain from a
patient resident in Belém, although epidemiological
investigations in the workplace and residence of the patient
revealed no evidence of extensive SLEV transmission
(Pinheiro et al., 1981). The subgenotype VB was also
isolated in the north-eastern and southern regions of Pará,
respectively, in the municipalities of Ipixuna (1960),
Itaituba (1971, 1973) and Marabá (1984) (Table 1, Fig. 2).

The phylogenetic analysis suggested a broad distribution of
SLEV genotype VIII in the Amazon (Fig. 2). Genotype VIII
represented 41.7 % (n55) and 61.5 % (n58) of the
Amazonian isolates from the 1970s (n512) and 1980s
(n513), respectively. Subgenotype VIIIA was already
detected in Brazil in 1964, as demonstrated by strain
BRA-64B. Furthermore, strains were also detected in 1984
in different municipalities from distinct geographical

regions of Pará state (Altamira, Belém, Monte Alegre and
Tucuruı́) (Figs 1 and 2); SLEV subgenotype VIIIB was
equally dispersed and was also detected in the state of Mato
Grosso (Fig. 2).

In the surveillance site neighbouring Belém, the subgeno-
types VA, VB, VIIIA and VIIIB were also detected. The VIIIA
and VIIIB subgenotypes were identified until 1984 (Figs 1
and 2); however, it was not possible to conclude whether
there is current circulation of these subgenotypes in the
Brazilian Amazon due to the small numbers of SLEV strains
isolated in the years following those included in the analysis.

The two SLEV strains isolated in São Paulo state, south-
eastern Brazil, were distinct from those from the Brazilian
Amazon region, with one strain (BRA-68) identified as a
member of genotype II and the other (BRA-04) a member
of genotype III (Santos et al., 2006). The BRA-04 strain was
isolated from a patient with clinical symptoms suggestive

of dengue fever (Rocco et al., 2005) and was genetically
related to SLEV strains isolated from Culex quinquefascia-
tus mosquitoes during a SLEV outbreak in 2005 in
Córdoba, Argentina (Diaz et al., 2006; May et al., 2008).

Based on the time-scaled analysis, our results suggested
that SLEV genotype II was the first to emerge in the
Americas between 1898 and 1930, followed, in order, by
genotypes I, VI, VIII, IV, VII, III and V within a period of
42 years between 1936 and 1978.

In conclusion, this study identified a new genetic lineage of
SLEV (genotype VIII) and demonstrated that genotypes V
and VIII are largely distributed in the Brazilian Amazon,
whereas genotypes II and III are genetic lineages that
circulate in an area restricted to the south-east Atlantic
Forest system (state of São Paulo). To understand better
the spread of SLEV in the Americas regarding different
populations and geographical regions, further studies using

robust phylogenetic inferences and more strains from other
South American regions are needed.

METHODS

Viral samples. Thirty low-passage-number SLEV strains were
obtained from the reference arbovirus collection at the Department
of Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fevers, Instituto Evandro Chagas,
Brazil, isolated between 1964 and 2002 in the states of Pará (n528),
Rondônia (n51) and Mato Grosso (n51) (Table 1). The viral strains
were obtained primarily from infected newborn mice brains. The
lyophilized strains were rehydrated and recovered after a single
passage in Vero cells.

RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of
infected Vero cells exhibiting approximately 75 % cytopathic effect.
RNA extractions were performed using the Trizol LS method (Gibco
Life Sciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

RT-PCR. The SLEV full-length E gene was amplified by RT-PCR
using three sets of primers specific to the E region (F880/B1629,

F1390/C207 and F1990/B2586; Kramer & Chandler, 2001). Amplicons

were purified using a PureLink Quick Gel Extraction kit (Invitrogen)

and the cDNA was sequenced directly using the dideoxyribonucleo-

tide chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) in an automated

capillary sequencer (ABI 3130; Applied Biosystems) using an ABI

PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction v3.1 kit

(Applied Biosystems). Amplicons were sequenced in both directions

using the same primers as for the RT-PCRs.

Assembly and sequence analysis. The obtained sequences were first
analysed for quality and then assembled into a single contig using the

SeqMan v5.0 program (LaserGene; DNAStar). Multiple sequence

alignment was performed using CLUSTAL_X software to determine the

genetic divergence among the studied strains. The genetic divergence

within and between groups was assessed using MEGA v4.0 software

(Kumar et al., 2008) and used to estimate a CV to define the phylogenetic

grouping. The CV was determined as described previously (Medeiros

et al., 2007) as the mean of genetic divergence within and between groups

based on well-established SLEV genotypes (genotypes I–VII). Viruses

were grouped when the genetic divergence within a given group was less

than the CV; strains were excluded from a given group if the value for the

genetic divergence within the group was greater than or equal to the CV.

Phylogenetic analysis and evolution. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed by comparing the entire E gene sequences obtained for the

30 Brazilian SLEV strains with sequences of homologous regions from

103 other SLEV strains (see Supplementary Table S1, available in JGV

Online) available in GenBank.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the NJ (Saitou & Nei,

1987), ML and MP methods using PAUP v4.0 software (Swofford,

1999). The Modeltest v3.6 program (Posada & Crandall, 1998) was

used to determine the best nucleotide substitution model to be used

according to the Akaike information criteria. For the NJ method, a

distance matrix was calculated using the aligned sequences using the

Tamura three-parameter and gamma distribution (gamma distri-

bution parameter51). For the MP method, a 4 : 1 transition : trans-
version ratio was used. Bootstrap replication (2000 replicates) was

applied to give confidence on phylogenetic grouping (Felsenstein,

1985). WNV strain NY99 (GenBank accession no. DQ211652) was

used as an outgroup to root the trees. Phylogenetic groups were

defined using the highest bootstrap or BPP values over each main

node in combination with the criteria for group inclusion or

exclusion using the CV as reference.

The nucleotide substitution model selected by Modeltest was also

used to estimate trees using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo

approaches implemented in MrBayes and BEAST (Drummond et al.,

2003). In this case, the final tree presented was the maximum clade

credibility tree estimated in BEAST with a chain length of 175 million,

sampling every 1000. The BPP was estimated from the data obtained

for 50 % of the generated consensus trees (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001).

The TRACER program (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) was

used to inspect whether MrBayes reached the appropriated conver-

gence. Nucleotide substitution rates and the age of the MRCA were

estimated for the whole dataset using models that allowed for rate

variation among lineages under a relaxed (uncorrelated exponential)

molecular clock (Drummond et al., 2006) performed in BEAST where

tip times corresponded to the year of virus sampling (Drummond

et al., 2003). Bootstrap values less than 75 % and a BPP less than 0.9

were not represented in the final tree.

slaughterhouse. Also included in the study were
a small number of human sera collected in 1961
and 1962 at three sitesâ€”La Gallareta, ParanÃ¡
and Corrientesâ€”on the ParanÃ¡River in the
Litoral region of northeastern Argentina.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The human donors, all apparently healthy,
were of both sexes and ranged in age from 4 to
69 years. Wild mammals were generally caught
alive in traps and wild birds in mist nets, but
occasionally mammals and birds were caught by
hand or shot. Bats, rodents, marsupials and wild
birds were bled from the heart, domestic birds
from the wing vein, cattle, horses and goats from
the jugular vein, and rabbits from the marginal
ear vein. At the slaughterhouse, animals were
bled after death. Bird bloods were collected in
heparinized syringes. After separation, all speci
mens were stored at â€”15Â°Cuntil tested.

Table 2 lists the 24 arboviruses used in this
study, their strain numbers and passage levels in
newborn mice. All strains were isolated in Brazil:
the WEE strain in Rio de Janeiro,2 Itaporanga
in SÃ£oPaulo State3 and the rest in the Amazon
region by the BelÃ©mVirus Laboratory. BE Ar
7272 virus has been shown by Whitman4 to differ
slightly from prototype Cache Valley virus in
antigenic properties, but for convenience it will
be referred to in this paper as â€œCacheValley.â€•

Hernagglutinating antigens were prepared
basically by the methods of Clarke and Ca.sals,5
and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were
done in plastic plates by a microtechnique de
scribed by one of the authors.6 Sera were cx
tracted twice with acetone prior to testing.
Antigen titers were corrected to 4 units, and
serum HI levels of 1:20 or greater on this basis
were considered positive. Titers of HI positive
sera were determined using 2-fold dilutions.

In neutralization (N) tests, infected newborn
mouse brain was used as virus source for Bus
suquara, Cache Valley and Turlock viruses, and
viremic sera of newborn mice for group A and
St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses. Sera were

Epizootics of equine encephalomyelitis, recur
ring at intervals of several years, have been
described in Argentina since 1919. Some of these
are known to have included CÃ³rdoba Province
in central Argentina, and during the most recent
epizootic, in 1958, the viruses of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE)' and western equine enceph
alitis (WEE) were isolated in this provrnce from
horses. Since the vectors and reservoirs of these
viruses in CÃ³rdobaare unknown, and the possible
presence of other arboviruses has never been ex
plored, a serosurvey by hemagglutination-inhibi
tion and neutralization tests was undertaken
among human residents and domestic and wild
mammals @ndbirds.

CÃ³rdoba Province is located in the southern
temperate zone, between 29@and 35Â°south lati
tude and 62Â°and 66Â°west longitude. The annual
median temperature ranges from 17Â°Cin the
southeastern portion to 20Â°Cin the northwest.
The rainfall pattern is one of wet summers and
dry winters; the annual median precipitation is
lowest, 200 mm, in the hill area of the northwest
and rises to 800 mm in the fertile plains of the
southeast.

Between June 1962 and June 1963, various
localities representative of different ecological
zones in the province were sampled (Fig. 1).
Table 1 lists the numbers of serum specimens
collected by type and locality. Human serum
specimens were collected from the rural popula
tions at Chancam, Pins, Pocho and Medanito

in the northwest; Calera in the foothills along
the Rio Primero ; Oncativo and Marcos Ju@rez.
Blood specimens from non-human vertebrates
(mammals and birds) were collected at Calera;
Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck
farming; and Manfredi, the center of an agricul
tural grazing zone. In addition, wild birds were
captured on a hill near Piquillmn and cattle from
various parts of the province were bled at a

test. This single positive was from a 7-year-old
boy at Medanito. Three HI negative sera from
other Medanith residents (aged 5, 8 and 31 years)
failed to protect against 100 LD5, of EEE virus.

While there was a greater incidence of group
A HI antibody among the sera from mammals
and birds, the number of positives was still small.
Excluding the results at Manfredi where horses
had a history of vaccination with EEE and WEE
vaccines, only 34 sera reacted with one or more
antigens. These sera came from horses, chickens,
cattle and wild birds.

In the case of EEE virus, three of 41 sera from
unvaccinated horses at Colonia Tirolesa reacted
in HI test, two at a titer of 1:20 and one at 1:80.
All three sera neutralized at least 10,000 LD@ of
virus, while three HI negative horse sera failed
to protect against 100 LD@. Only one cattle
serum was positive for EEE in both HI test
(1 :40) and N test (320 LD@). Three HI negative
cattle sera neutralized 800, 200 and 100 LD@.;
however, since nonspecific neutralization of EEE
virus by cattle sera has been reported,7 these
results are not considered conclusive.

Table 3 gives the details for the six sera that
were positive in HI and/or N test for WEE or
AiiM, viruses closely related.8 Horse serum No.
3 is considered positive for WEE with an liii
munological cross-reaction with Aura, but the
reactions may be due to a double infection. Serum
No. 4, from a Furnar-lus rufus, perhaps represents
infection with AiiM, although the low dosage
used in the N test leaves this a question. The
five HI negative sera (two horse, three chicken)
included in these N tests failed to neutralize the
dosages used.

Two of 63 sera from chickens at Colonia Tiro
lesa reacted with Mayaro antigen at a titer of
1:20, and one of these neutralized at least 160
LD@of virus. The second HI positive serum was
negative in N test, as was the only HI negative
serum tested.

The other sera HI positive for group A viruses
reacted in dilutions of 1:20 or 1:40 and were
uniformly negative in N test. Eighteen of these
sera reacted with only one antigen: EEE, one
Columbina, one Zenaidura and one chicken ; Una,
three ZOnOtriCJ&ia,two Zenaidura, one M@thrus
bo.dius, one Columbina, one Spinus mageilanieus
and one Glaucidium brasilianum; and Pixuna,
one Columbina, two cattle and three chickens.
One M. badius serum had HI antibody for two

with equal amounts of one or more 10-fold dilu
tions of virus; in the case of SLE virus half log

arithmic dilutions (1:10, 1:32, 1:100, 1:320,
etc.) were used. The serum-virus mixtures were
incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°Cbefore inoculation
into newborn mice. Cache Valley virus was in
oculated intracerebrally and all other viruses
intraperitoneally.

RESULTS

All sera were initially screened in HI tests with
each antigen, except in the case of Itaporanga
where only 50 sera were tested, all from human
donors. In meet instances the HI positive sera,
as well as selected HI negative sera, were tested
in N test with the appropriate viruses. Results
are presented below arranged according to virus
group.

1075ARBOVIRUS SURVEY IN ARGENTINA

TABLE 1
Numbers of serum specimens collected in Cdrdoba Province and Litoral region, Argentina, 1961-1988

S The most commonly sampled species were : Zonotrichia capensis, Molothrus badius, Pitangus suiphu

ratus, Passer domesticus, Chloroceryle americana, Machetornis rixosa, Furnar'ius rufus, Nystalus macu
tatus, Pseudoseisura lophotes, Coryphistera alaudina, Guira guira, Zenaidura auriculata and Columbina

viruses, Mayaro and Pixuna. Finally, one M.
badius, one M. bonariensis and one Pitangus
reacted with three antigensâ€”EEE, IJna and
Pixuna. In the N test with Una virus, an HI
negative serum from a Speotyto cunicularia, the
only bird of this species tested, protected five
out of six mice inoculated with 320 LD@oof virus.

Although Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis
(VEE) virus has been isolated in Argentina (as
cited by Bettinotti and Aguirre'), no serum
reacted with Mucambo virus, which is closely
related to VEE.@

Group B viruses. Table 4 shows the numbers of
sera that reacted with SLE antigen in HI test.
Titers of 1 : 160 or higher were seen. All of the
human sera that were HI positive for group B
were positive for SLE; some of them also reacted
with IlhÃ©usor Busauquara antigen or both, but
none reacted with yellow fever antigen. The SLE
positive sera from mammals and birds also
showed broad group B reactivity. In all cases,
however, titers for SLE were equal to or greater
than those for other group B antigens.

Fifty-four of these SLE positives were exam
ined in N test with SLE virus only, and 38 neu
trali.sed 50 or more LD.o. Of 20 sera HI negative

for group B, four neutralized 50 LD@oof SLE
virus. Sera positive for SLE in both tests came
from human donors in all localities surveyed
except Calera and from horses, goats, cattle,
chickens, turkeys, ducks and wild birds (Mob
thr'us badius, Chboroceryle, Furnarius, Zenaidura
and Columbina).

Eight sera from chickens and wild birds (M.
badius, Columbmnaand Zonotrichia) reacted only
with Bussuquara antigen in HI test and were
negative in N test against 100 LD@oof virus. Of
five HI negative sera tested with Buseuquara in
N test, one chicken serum from Colonia Tirolesa
was protective.

Bunyamwera group viruses. Forty-one of 87

sera from horses reacted in HI test with Cache
Valley antigen, 17 at dilutions of 1 :80 or higher.
Three of the positive horse sera which had titers
of 1:640, 1:160 and 1:80 with Cache Valley
also reacted with Guaroa antigen at titers of
1:20 and 1:40. Twelve other seraâ€”sixhuman,
two mule, one goat and three cattleâ€”inhibited
Cache Valley antigen at dilutions no higher than
1 :80. Table 5 shows locality and titer for the six

positive human sera. No serum reacted only with
Guaroa antigen.

not done with these viruses. No serum reacted
with Oriboca, Murutucu, Cati@,BE An 46852
(Anhanga) or Itaporanga antigen.

DISCUSSION

Unexpectedly, little reactivity with EEE and
WEE viruses was encountered in this survey.
Both HI and neutralizing substance for EEE
virus was demonstrated in only five sera (one
human, three horse, one cattle) and for WEE in
only three sera, all from horses. The other HI
positive reactions with these viruses occurred
at low titers and are considered nonspecific, a!
though they may represent response to a group
A agent not included in the study.

The greatest numbers of sera reacted with
SLE and Cache Valley viruses. These two viruses
accounted for all the positive reactions in human
sera from the Litoral region. Sera positive for
SLE in both HI and N tests came from human
donors in all localities except Calera and from
horses, cattle, goats, and wild and domestic
birds. Added to the serological evidence of SLE
activity among residents of Tucum@n, Mendoza
and Buenos Aires obtained by Mettler et ob.,â€•'
these results indicate a wide dispersal of SLE
neutralizing substance in Argentina. Assuming
specificity of the neutralization and a short life
span of some of the animals involved, these
results may also indicate recent virus activity.

The excellent correlation of HI and N test
positive reactions with Cache Valley virus sug
gest.s that this agent or one closely related has
been active in CÃ³rdoba Province, involving
horses and to a lesser degree man and goats.

Of the different ecological zones sampled,
Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck
farming, had the highest rate of positivity as well

Thirty-five HI positive sera and 25 HI nega

at this location were at least 5 years old and thus

could have been infected during the 195S equine
encephalomyelitis epizootic or earlier. The fact
that no birds were N test l)ositive for EEE and

Several domestic and wild birds had HI or

viruses, These results may indicate the presence
of one or more additional group A agents In

were not inactivated, the results may represent
the effect of nonspecific, heat-labile neutralizing
substance.

SUMMARY

Serum specimens from human beings (159)
and domestic and wild mammals and birds (884)
were collected in CÃ´rdoba Province, Argentina,
during 1962-1963 and tested in hemagglutina
tion-inhibition (HI) and neutralization (N) tests
with 24 arboviruses representing groups A, B,
C, GuamÃ¡, Bunyamwera, Turlock and Phieboto

mus fever plus one ungrouped agent. Included in
the study were 54 human sera collected in the
Litoral region of northeastern Argentina in 1961
and 1962.

There was a high incidence of HI and N test
reactors with BE Ar 7272, a Cache Valley-like
agent, among human beings, horses and goats,
and with St. Louis encephalitis virus among
human beings, wild and domestic birds, horses,
cattle and goats. A few sera neutralized eastern
or western encephalitis, Turlock, Aura, Mayaro
or Una virus. Of the different localities sampled,
Colonia Tirolesa, in an area of irrigated truck
farming, had the highest rate of positivity and
the greatest variety of antibody.

West Nile Virus

Kunjin (KUN) and West Nile (WN) viruses belong to the
Japanese encephalitis (JE) antigenic complex of the
Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (1). The
Flavivirus genus comprises >70 antigenically related,
positive-stranded RNA viruses (2,3). KUN and WN viruses
are maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving
mosquito vectors and bird reservoir hosts, with humans and
horses believed to be incidental hosts (4,5). Clinical symptoms
most commonly associated with infection with KUN and WN
viruses include febrile illness or mild encephalitis. WN virus
has been associated with fatal cases of acute meningoenceph-
alitis and fulminant hepatitis (6).

Early cross-neutralization studies with polyclonal
antisera raised to single strains of WN and KUN viruses
revealed that these viruses shared a close relationship but
were antigenically distinct (7-9). This close relationship was
also shown genetically by Coia et al. (10), who compared the
sequence of the MRM61C KUN isolate with that of a Ugandan
strain of WN (WNFCG) (11-13) and showed that the
nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity between the two
viruses was 82% and 93%, respectively, in the coding region of
the genome. Although genetic studies have shown that KUN
virus exists in Australia as a single topotype with <2%
nucleotide divergence (14,15), Berthet et al. (16) demonstrat-
ed that WN viruses were divided into two lineages. Although
these comparisons demonstrated a close relationship between
the two viruses, further sequence information is needed from
additional isolates of both viruses to fully establish their

phylogenetic association within the genus. This report
describes the results of sequence analyses of 31 Australian
KUN isolates; a KUN isolate from Sarawak, Malaysia; and 28
WN isolates from Africa, India, Europe, and New York
(Tables 1 and 2). These virus isolates had all been identified
as WN or KUN virus by traditional antigenic means. The
Koutango (KOU) isolate was also included in this study, as it
belongs to the JE serogroup and is closely related to the KUN/
WN group of viruses (9,17).

Materials and Methods

Virus and Cell Culture
Virus strains sequenced in this study are listed with their

sources of isolation in Table 1. African green monkey (Vero)
cells were grown at 37°C in M199 (Gibco, New York) with 20
mM HEPES (Gibco) and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine
and either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for growth or 2% FBS
for maintenance. Viruses were cultured in Vero cells by
inoculating cell monolayers with virus at a multiplicity of
infection of 1. Infected cell culture supernatants were
harvested when  >70% of the cells exhibited cytopathic effect.
Infected supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 x
g at 4°C for 15 min, and aliquots were stored at -70°C. A line
of Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells was cultured in M199
without HEPES and supplemented with FBS for growth or
maintenance, as described. The cells were incubated at 28°C
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Sequencing

A single-step RT-PCR procedure (22) was performed on
each virus isolate. The region amplified within the envelope

Until recently, West Nile (WN) and Kunjin (KUN) viruses were classified as
distinct types in the Flavivirus genus. However, genetic and antigenic studies on
isolates of these two viruses indicate that the relationship between them is more
complex. To better define this relationship, we performed sequence analyses on
32 isolates of KUN virus and 28 isolates of WN virus from different geographic
areas, including a WN isolate from the recent outbreak in New York. Sequence
comparisons showed that the KUN virus isolates from Australia were tightly
grouped but that the WN virus isolates exhibited substantial divergence and
could be differentiated into four distinct groups. KUN virus isolates from Australia
were antigenically homologous and distinct from the WN isolates and a
Malaysian KUN virus. Our results suggest that KUN and WN viruses comprise a
group of closely related viruses that can be differentiated into subgroups on the
basis of genetic and antigenic analyses.

(E) gene used the primers KUN5276 (GCG TGT GGT TCT
TCA AAC TCC A) and WN4752 (TGC GTG TCC AAC CAT
GGG TGA AGC) with the isolates Sarafend, MP502-66, and a
strain of KOU virus, DakAad 5443. Primer KUN5276 was
used with primer KUN4778 (ATA ATG ACA AGC GGG CTG
ACC C) for the remaining isolates. The region of the virus
genome encompassing the terminus of the nonstructural
protein, NS5 and the 5' end of the 3' untranslated region
(3’UTR), was amplified by using the previously published
universal flavivirus PCR primers EMF1 and VD8 (23).

Both strands of the PCR product were then sequenced on
a 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Internation-
al [ABI], Foster City, CA, USA) by using the same primer pair.
The two sequences derived from each PCR product were
initially aligned by using the program SeqEd (ABI) and a
consensus sequence determined. The consensus sequences
were then aligned by using the program Clustal W (24), and
results were further analyzed by using phylogenetic programs
in Bionavigator (http://www.bionavigator.com). Percentage
nucleotide similarity was calculated by the Old Distance
(GCG) program, and bootstrap confidence levels were
calculated with 1,000 replicates by using the Consense
program (25). Sequences determined in this study have been
deposited in GenBank (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA) (Table 1). Additional sequences included
in this analysis are listed in Table 2.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Antigenic profiles of each isolate were compared by using

a panel of anti-KUN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (26,27)
and anti-WN MAbs (28,29) in ELISA as described (26). All

MAbs were produced to the E protein except for 3.1112G,
which was specific for the NS1 protein.

Results

Genetic Analysis
In accordance with previous reports (16,18,21), the

phylogenetic trees generated from both E gene and NS5/
3'UTR sequences grouped most of the isolates into two major
lineages (Figures 1 and 2). Australian KUN isolates and WN
isolates from North, West, and central Africa; southern and
eastern Europe; India; the Middle East; and New York
constituted lineage I. Lineage II comprised WN isolates from
West, central, and East Africa and Madagascar. Genetic
lineage was not significantly associated with date or source of
isolation, with most isolates of both lineages coming from
human, mosquito, and avian sources between 1950 and 1990.
However, as noted, all viruses isolated during outbreaks of
human or avian disease in the last decade belonged to lineage
I. Lineage I viruses grouped together with an average
sequence identity of 80% (E gene) and 77% (NS5/3'UTR),
while the viruses of lineage II contained a single cluster with
an average identity of 82% and 83%, respectively. The lineage
I viruses were further separated into three clusters: the
Australian KUN isolates; the Indian WN viruses; and WN
isolates from Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North
America. The divergence observed between lineage I and
lineage II viruses was in the range of 16.5% to 30.8% and 19%
to 36.5% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR,
respectively. High bootstrap confidence levels (100%) for the
sequences of the NS5/3'UTR also support the separation of the

two lineages and the branching of the NY99 cluster of WN
viruses with the Australian KUN viruses in lineage I, rather
than with the WN group of viruses in lineage II. The
clustering of the Indian WN group in lineage I based on
sequences in the E gene, however, was at a lower bootstrap
confidence level  (63%).

The sequence of the virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502-
66, grouped outside the two lineages described. Similarly, the
KOU virus, which was 72%-73% identical to KUN MP502-66,
did not group with either lineage. The range of percentage
divergence between KUN MP502-66 and KOU viruses with
the lineage I and lineage II viruses (Table 3) shows that these
two isolates display similar divergence from all other isolates
in this study, supporting their grouping outside the two main
lineages.

The viruses of lineage I group together in three tight
clusters. The first of these includes the Australian KUN
viruses, which were 94% identical when sequences of the E
gene were compared and 90% when the sequences of the NS5/
3'UTR were compared. High bootstrap confidence levels
(100% for sequences from the E gene and 99% for sequences

from the NS5/3’UTR) separated the Australian KUN viruses
from the other isolates. However, extremely low bootstrap
confidence levels were observed for most of the branches
between the Australian KUN viruses in both dendrograms,
which also suggests that these viruses are closely related and
cannot be definitively separated from each other. The Indian
viruses also cluster together, with a sequence identity of 97%
and 98% for sequences of the E gene and NS5/3'UTR,
respectively. The WN isolates in the remaining cluster of
lineage I are 90% and 97% identical, respectively, for the
regions sequenced. When compared with the Australian KUN
isolates, this cluster, which includes the 1999 New York
isolate, shared a sequence identity of 89% for the E gene and

88% for the NS5/3'UTR. Similarly, when the sequences of the
Australian KUN isolates were compared with those of the WN
Indian viruses, they were 80% identical for the E gene and
77% identical for the NS5/3'UTR. In comparison, the two
clusters of WN viruses in lineage I and the WN isolates in
lineage II shared an average sequence identity of only 78%
and 71% for the E gene and NS5/3'UTR, respectively. These
results demonstrate that the sequences of some WN isolates
are more closely related to the Australian KUN viruses than
to other WN isolates.

The high degree of nucleotide sequence homology within
clusters is consistent with the observed similarity of the
amino acid sequences. The most notable variation in amino
acid sequence in this study appears around the potential
glycosylation site at amino acid 154 of the E protein (Figure
3). The Australian KUN viruses generally contain either the
glycosylation motif NYS at this position or the sequence NYF,
which abolishes glycosylation of the E protein. In contrast, the
KUN virus SH183 has a 154N→ K  substitution, which also
ablates the potential for glycosylation at this site. In
comparison with the KUN prototype, the amino acids 159
(T→ I, T→ V, or T→ Q) and 162 (A→ T) of all the WN isolates in

this study contain an amino acid substitution. The KUN
isolate P1553 also differs from the KUN prototype at amino
acid 159 (T→ I). Two aberrant isolates, 63134Ent280 and
WNFCG, incur a deletion of four amino acids (154 through
157), which also abolishes the glycosylation site.

Our results concur with those of Berthet et al. (16), who
suggested the presence of signature motifs within the E gene
that support the segregation of WN viruses into two lineages.
These signature residues include the amino acid substitu-
tions from lineage I→ II as follows: 172A→ S, 205T→ S, and
210T→ S. The amino acid substitution 208T→ A holds true in
general; however, two of the Indian isolates (lineage I) have K
at this position and WNFCG (lineage II) has E. Of particular
note is the substitution at amino acid 199. The Australian
KUN isolates (199S) share the same amino acid as the lineage
II WN viruses, while the lineage I viruses contain an N
residue at this position. We have also identified an additional
three signature motifs (I→ II) at amino acids 128R→ W,
129T→ I, and 131L→ Q. When we attempted to place the
Malaysian KUN isolate within either lineage by using these
signature motifs, the residues at 128, 129, 131, 172, and 208
were similar to those of lineage I viruses, but the residues at

205 and 210 were consistent with those of lineage II viruses.
Residue 199 (D) was unlike any of the other viruses. The KOU
isolate displayed more similarities with the lineage II WN
viruses (residues 131, 172, 199, and 210) when signature
motifs were compared. Residues 129 and 208 differed from
viruses of both lineages.

We have identified signature motifs within the NS5
protein that correlate with the separation of the two lineages.
Substitutions between lineages I→ II include 860A→ T,
869Q→ H, 878I→ V (except for the isolate MgAn798, which
has 878I→ L), and 899L→ V (except for the isolate ArNa1047,
which has 899L→ I) (Figure 4). At amino acid 877, the lineage
I WN viruses are separated again from the lineage II WN
viruses with an A→ S substitution; however, the KUN isolates
(including MP502-66 from Malaysia) have the same motif as
the lineage II WN viruses (877S). The amino acid substitution
at 903 separates the Indian WN viruses (903S) from the WN
and KUN viruses of both lineages (903T), instead grouping
them with the Malaysian isolate and the KOU virus. Once
again, the signature motifs cannot be used to classify the
Malaysian isolate and KOU virus into either lineage.

Nucleotide sequences in the 3'UTR of the viruses
included in this study had a highly variable region in both
length and nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of
the open reading frame stop codon (Figure 5). Deletions as
well as point mutations were observed in this region, which
varied from 38 (MgAn798) to 129 (ArNa1047) nt in length.
The Australian KUN viruses displayed only point mutations
when compared with the KUN prototype, except for the isolate
P1553, which contained a 7-nt insertion, consistent with the

WN viruses of lineage I. The long deletion in the nucleotide
sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of the
WN prototype virus, WNFCG (53 nt), has been described (31);
it is also present in the sequences of another two lineage II
WN viruses analyzed in this study, Sarafend (53 nt) and
MgAn798 (65 nt). The rest of the 3'UTR for these viruses was
found to be highly conserved.

Antigenic Analysis
The MAb 10A1, produced to the KUN isolate OR393 (26),

reacted specifically with the Australian KUN isolates in
ELISA and did not react with the KUN isolate from Malaysia
(MP502-66) nor with KOU virus or any of the lineage I or
lineage II WN viruses (Table 4). The MAb 546 (29), produced
to the WN strain Eg101, reacted with all the lineage I and
lineage II WN isolates except WN-Sarafend; it did not react
with the KOU, KUN, or Malaysian viruses. The MAbs 2B2,
produced to the KUN isolate MRM 16 (27), and 2B4, produced
to the WN isolate H442 (28), reacted with all the isolates in
the study, while the MAbs 3.67G and 3.91D, again produced
to the KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all the isolates
except WN-Sarafend. The MAb 3.1112G, produced to the NS1
protein of KUN isolate OR393 (26), reacted with all isolates
except KOU. The Mab binding patterns (Table 4) clearly
digress and fail to differentiate KUN and WN isolates into two
distinct groups. Instead, they define five distinct antigenic
groups: Australian KUN viruses, Malaysian KUN virus,
lineage I and lineage II WN viruses, WN-Sarafend, and KOU
virus.

Conclusion
The results of the phylogenic analysis in this report

clearly illustrate that the KUN, WN, and KOU viruses make
up a closely related group of viruses, which can be further
subdivided into several subgroups on the basis of genetic and
antigenic data. Previous phylogenic studies have also shown
that KUN and WN viruses share a close relationship (16-
18,21). This report however, further defines this relationship
by using a comprehensive panel of both viruses. Also included
in this study were several anomalous isolates, including an
isolate from Southeast Asia (MP502-66), a laboratory-adapted
WN strain of uncertain passage history and origin (Sarafend),
and a flavivirus from West Africa (KOU), which has been
shown to be closely related to the KUN/WN group of viruses.

The region sequenced in the E gene spans a glycosylation
site that, although highly conserved among viruses of the JE
antigenic subgroup, is absent from many KUN and WN
isolates (16,26; Scherret JH, Khromykh AA, Mackenzie JS,
Hall RA, unpub. data). While glycosylation at this site has
been associated with neuroinvasiveness of WN isolates in
mice (32,33), the biological significance of E protein
glycosylation is still unclear. Indeed, sequence analysis of the
E gene of WN viruses responsible for fatal outbreaks of
encephalitis in Romania (Rom 96) and New York (NY99)
showed that only the latter contained a potential
glycosylation site, casting doubt on the importance of E
protein glycosylation in viral pathogenesis. However, our
studies and those of others have shown that limited passage of
WN and KUN viruses in some cell types can alter the
glycosylation status of the E protein and that analysis of
passaged viral isolates should be interpreted with caution

data).

The 3'UTR of flaviviruses
ranges in length from 400 nt to 600
nt and is thought to play a crucial
role in the initiation and regula-
tion of viral translation, replica-
tion, and assembly. It includes a
potential stable secondary RNA
structure at its terminus (2,34-38),
and upstream it contains several
domains that appear to be con-
served among mosquito-borne fla-
viviruses (2,39, 40). Men et al. (41)
have suggested that deletions in
the distal 80 nt to 90 nt would most
likely lead to disruption of the
stem-loop and loss of viability. In
contrast, the region sequenced in
this study contains highly variable
regions suitable for genetic classi-
fication and analysis of the
relationships among viruses, which
had been subjected to deletions
or insertions or both during
evolution (17).

Phylogenetic trees con-
structed from sequence data from
both regions identified two major
lineages, consistent with previous
reports (16,18,21). These two
lineages did not separate the KUN
isolates from the WN isolates;
rather, they emphasized the close
link between KUN and WN
viruses of lineage I. Nevertheless,
within lineage I, the Australian
KUN isolates formed a tight
cluster with an average nucleotide
divergence of 6% for the E gene and
10% for the NS5/3'UTR. In con-
trast, the WN isolates were spread
between the two lineages in three
clusters, with a divergence of up to
30.6% for sequences of the E gene
and 28.3% for sequences of the
NS5/3'UTR. Signature motifs in
the deduced amino acid sequences

of the E and NS5 proteins also support the separation of the
viruses into two lineages.

The virus from Malaysia, KUN MP502-66, and the
African virus, KOU, pose a conundrum as to their relationship
with the WN and KUN group of viruses. Statistical support
for clustering with either of the WN lineages was poor,
suggesting that they represent two single-isolate lineages.
Although our previous findings suggested that the Malaysian
KUN isolate may represent an evolutionary link between the
KUN and WN viruses (17), the lack of sequence identity
between KUN MP502-66 and the KUN/WN group of viruses
in our study suggests that these viruses have evolved
separately from a common ancestor.

West Nile Virus

The binding patterns of MAbs to KUN and WN isolates
did not differentiate these viruses into the same phylogenetic
lineages observed in the dendrograms, although they did
support the sequencing results by identifying the Australian
KUN viruses, the Malaysian KUN virus, and KOU virus as
distinct antigenic groups. The WN-specific MAb used in this
study, 546, could not distinguish subgroups within the WN
group of viruses; however,  Besselaar and Blackburn (28) and
Damle et al. (42) have differentiated Indian WN isolates from
lineage I South African strains by using MAbs, consistent
with the earlier studies of Hammam et al. (43,44). These
findings support our sequence data, which show tight
clustering of the Indian isolates on a separate branch from
other WN isolates in the phylogenetic trees (Figures 1 and 2).
Additional MAbs to the E protein of WN viruses may be
required to differentiate between lineage I and lineage II
viruses.

The unique binding pattern of anti-E MAbs to the
Sarafend WN isolate is difficult to explain in light of the E
gene sequencing results and amino acid alignments, which
show that this virus is similar to other lineage II viruses.
However, Sarafend also differs from other WN viruses in the
way that it buds from the cell membrane of infected cells (45).
Sequencing of the entire prM and E genes of this virus may
identify the basis for structural differences in the envelope
heterodimer that account for the loss of MAb binding sites and
unusual virion maturation.

Phylogenetic analyses enable more precise determina-
tion of the relationships among similar viruses and
consequently aid in identifying the origin of unknown viruses
in subsequent outbreaks. The importance of defining the
relationship between the KUN and WN viruses was
emphasized during the 1999 outbreak of viral encephalitis in
New York City (46,47). Until recently, WN and KUN had been
classified as distinct virus types in the Flavivirus genus.
However, the latest report by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (25) recognized that KUN and WN
should not be classified as two separate species and
designated KUN as a subtype of WN. Our results suggest that
this definition requires further consideration. The species
should perhaps be further subdivided into at least six
subtypes on the basis of the clusters of viruses displayed in
the phylogenetic trees. Subtypes would then include lineage
II WN group, Indian WN group, Australian KUN group,
lineage I WN group, Malaysian group, and KOU group.

Indeed, the assessment of viruses from each subgroup for
transmissibility by the major mosquito vectors of each
geographic region and relative virulence and amplification in
primate, equine, and avian species will provide valuable
information on the likelihood and possible consequences of
the spread of these viruses to new geographic regions.
Additional studies of cross-protection between subgroups by
natural infection or immunization with vaccines derived from
these viruses and the specificity and sensitivity of serologic
and molecular assays for each subgroup in monitoring and
diagnostic applications will be useful in defining control
strategies.

Abstract. Plasmas of sloths and other Central Panamanian wild vertebrates were tested
for plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibodies against four flaviviruses and one alpha
virus. Forty percent of 97 two-toed sloths, Choloepus hoffmanni, and 8% of 168 three-toed
sloths, Brady/ms variegatus, were specifically positive against St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
virus. The prevalence of antibody against SLE virus was considerably higher in sloths than
in any other group of wild vertebrates tested, including birds, and was found mainly in adult
sloths. Specific PRN antibody against yellow fever (YF) virus was found only in monkeys.
A high prevalence of PRN antibody against Ihhcus and Mayaro viruses was detected in agoutis,
Dasyprocta punctata, and against Mayaro virus in howler monkeys, Alouatta villosa. No
plasma was specifically positive against Bussuquara virus. The results are interpreted as
evidence that sloths are probably not important hosts in jungle YF cycles, but may be sig
nificant amplifying hosts in tropical SLE virus cycles.

Tree sloths are New World arboreal mammals
related to armadillos and anteaters. They occur
from Honduras to Argentina. The two existing
genera include Bradypus, the three-toed sloths,
and Choloepus, the two-toed sloths. Although they
share the same arboreal habitat and many con
vergent anatomical features, the behavioral and
anatomical differences between the two genera are
clear enough to place them in separate families. â€˜@2

Sloths arc difficult or impossible to see when cam
ouflaged in their forest canopy habitat, but they
are nevertheless among the most abundant mam
mals of the Neotropical forest.@5 Both genera arc
characterized by bow body temperature and met
abobic rate,6 and are highly evolved for a vege
tanian@ Choloepus commonly survive in

captivity for over 10 years,7 8 and probably both
genera are bonghived in nature.

Interest in sloths as hosts of flaviviruses initially
centered on the search for alternate hosts in New
World jungle yellow fever (YF) cycles, which are
usually considered to involve monkeys and forest
canopy mosquitoes.9 10In early experimental work,
Colombian two-toed sloths Choloepus didactylus
showed little potential as YF amplifying hosts.9
In 1974, P. A. Webb and K. M. Johnson of the
Gorgas Memorial Laboratory repeated this obser
vation with the Panamanian species Choloepus
hoffmanni ; however, they also showed that some
Panamanian Bradypus variegatus sustained re

markabby bong experimental YF viremias of un
usually high titer, with no apparent ill effects.â€•

The hypothesis that sloths are natural amphi
fying hosts of YF virus was tested by field studies
in Panama in 1974â€”76,during and after a wave
of jungle YF. These and other concurrent field
studies also included observations on related fla
viviruses, among them St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
virus, a human pathogen which is transmitted by
mosquitoes among wild birds in most of North

12 In the tropics, SLE virus causes spo

radic human illness, but its natural cycle is poorly
13 As with YF virus, inoculation of

sloths with SLE virus produces prolonged vire

mias of high@ Field studies of flavivirus in

fections of sloths were therefore a test of the role
of these animals in tropical cycles of SLE virus as
well as YF virus.

fections of sloths and other forest vertebrates.
Other anticles in this series describe experimental
SLE infection of sloths and conmonants,'4 as well
as the isolation from sloths of several viruses un
related to flaviviruses.15

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study areas

Sloths were captured at five Central Panama
nian localities (Fig. 1). At Aguacate (elevation
300 meters) and Chilibre (100 meters), vegetation
was mostly secondary, with patches of primary
tropical humid forest (Holdnidge ifi'6
At the other three areas the vegetation was pre
dominantly primary, with the following Holdridge
classifications: El Llano-CantI road camp (eleva
tion 300 meters), tropical wet forest; Cerno Azul
(500â€”800 meters), tropical humid forest; MajÃ©
(less than 200 meters) tropical humid-to-dry tran
sitional forest.

Animal capture and bleeding

Two-toed sloths C. hoffmanni (Fig. 2), and three
toed sloths B. variegatus (Fig. 3), were captured
by hand; at Cerro Azul, they were fitted with ra
dio transmitters'7 and periodically recaptured for
serial blood samples. Sloth age was determined as
infant when the animal was still attached to its

mother, juvenile when it was independent but not
fully grown, and adult when it had reached full
size, (Brady/ms forearm 180 mm; Choloepus fore
arm 170 mm). B. variegatus leave their mothers

at 6 months, and are fully grown at two years.4
Choloepus sloths probably develop somewhat more
slowly.18

Most other mammals and birds were either

trapped or netted routinely by the Gongas Me
monial Laboratory Bayano Riven Program, on nes

cued from impounded waters by the International
Society for the Protection of Animals (ISPA). At
El Llano-CantI and Cenro Azul, howler monkeys
and other mammals, apart from sloths, were shot.
Mammals which were shot or which were cap
tuned by ISPA were bled by cardiac puncture.

Otherwise, sloths were bled from the brachial vein;
rodents, bats and marsupials from the netroonbital
sinus, and binds from the external jugular vein.
In the field, whole hepaninized blood was frozen
in liquid nitrogen within 2 hours of collection.
Plasma was aseptically separated from hepanin
ized blood either by centnifugation on by overnight
settling, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen until
transfer to electric freezers. Whole blood was stored
at â€”60Â°C,and plasma at â€”20Â°C.

Virus isolation attempts

Heparinized whole blood (0. 1 ml) was inoculated
onto tube cultures of Vero cells, which were main
tamed at 35Â°Cand observed for 14 days.

Neutralization tests

Test viruses included the four sylvatic flavivi
ruses known to occur in Panama: YF virus (French
neutrotropic strain); SLE virus, stnain Buena Vis
ta-7 , isolated from Panamanian mosquitoes in

1956; Bussuquana (BSQ) virus, strain GA-7, from

Panamanian mosquitoes captured in 196 1; and Il

heus (ILH) virus, strain Guat-245 , isolated in 1956
from Guatemalan mosquitoes. Mayano (MAY) vi
rus, an alphavirus, was included as an antigen to
control for non-specific plaque reduction, since it

is antigenically distinct from the four flaviviruses;
it was also included because its natural transmis
sion cycle is thought to be similar to that of Neo
tropical jungle YF virus. We used MAY strain
Pan Ar 443 isolated in 1974 from Panamanian
mosquitoes.

Plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) tests were
basically performed as described@
Briefly, plasmas were screened 1:8 against 40â€”250
(generally 50â€”100)plaque forming units (pfu) of
challenge virus. Guinea pig serum at a final con
centration of 1:60 was incorporated in the virus
plasma mixture as a source of fresh serum factor.

The mixtures were incubated at 4Â°Covernight be
fore inoculation onto 2 cm2 Vero cell monolayens.
A second overlay including neutral red followed

2 on 3 days after the initial overlay, which varied

in composition for each virus. To enhance plaque
clarity, Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium re
placed the original basic nutrient medium in ILH
virus tests; gum tnagacanth was used in various
combinations with either aganose or agar in fla
vivinus overlays.

Plasmas reducing plaque counts by at beast 80%
were retested in serial dilutions; 90% plaque ne
duction by plasma diluted 1:16 was considered
positive. Plasmas positive against any one flavi
virus were subsequently titrated against all four
flavivinuses with approximately equal test virus
doses, for comparison of PRN titers. Low plasma
quantities reduced the number of screening anti
gens in tests of some animals.

RESULTS

Virus isolation attempts

No flaviviruses were isolated from 45 Bradypus
and 14 Choloepus. Other viruses isolated from
these animals are described elsewhere. 15

Antibody titers and test specificity

Ninety percent plaque reduction serum titers of
1:8 were considered negative because they wene
not reproducible. Also, in other di'5 titers of
1:8 have been associated with low level inhibition
of two or more unrelated viruses, suggesting broad
spectrum non-specific activity. Ninety percent ne
duction by plasmas diluted 1:16 was therefore
considered positive, but most positive titers were
at beast as high as 1:64. The frequency distribution
of sloth antibody PRN titers against SLE virus
are shown in Table 1, and are representative of
positive reactions seen in this study against other

togaviruses and in other vertebrates.

A possible problem of cross-reactions between
the four senobogically rebated flaviviruses was re
solved by experimental demonstration of the spec
ificity of sloth antibodies against SLE@ and
by the infrequency of multiple reactions and con
fusing titers in this study. In multiple positives,
differences in titer as little as 4- on 8-fold occurred
so rarely as to be insignificant, and in these cases,
antibody was considered specific against the an
tigen of higher titer for simplicity.

Sloth plasmas were never positive against more
than two of the four test flaviviruses. Even taking
into account reactions at 1:8 (a level considered

negative in this study), 73% of the positive ani
mals reacted against a single flavivirus. Of 14
multiple flavivirus reactions involving sloths pos
itive against SLE virus, 12 consisted of only a 1:8
reaction against another flavivirus, with the SLE
virus titer higher by at beast 16-fold (Table 1).
Only two sloth plasmas were considered to be pos
itive against both SLE and another flavivirus.
However the titers were 4- and 8-fold respectively
higher against SLE virus than the other agent (ILH
virus).

The specificity of PRN reactions was as clear
in most cases involving other flaviviruses and forest
vertebrates as it was for SLE virus and sloths. No
multiple positives were seen in three sloth plasmas
positive against ILH virus and two anteaters and
a bird positive against SLE virus. Of 12 monkeys
positive against YF virus (titers 1:32â€”1:512, mc
dian 1:128), eleven did not react with any other
flavivirus even at a 1:8 plasma dilution. The
twelfth monkey reacted at 1:128 against YF virus
and 1:64 against SLE virus, and probably was
infected by both agents.

Three of four ILH virus antibody-positive plas
mas from agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) were
multiple flavivirus positives. Although reactions
against ILH virus were always strongest (1:128-
1:1,024), titers against BSQ virus in three plasmas
were only 2-, 4-, and 16-fold lower than against
the corresponding ILH titers. Reactions against
YF virus were 8- to 64-fold bower than those
against ILH virus in two agouti phasmas.

The inclusion of MAY virus, an ahphavirus, in

the battery of test antigens proved useful in con
trolling for non-specific plaque inhibition. The
number of double alpha- and flavivirus positive
plasmas was not greater than that expected by
chance double infections.

Yellowfever virus

Only primates reacted specifically against YF
virus (Table 2). Of 14 howler monkeys, A. villosa,
from MajÃ©,only five juveniles did not have PRN
antibody against YF virus; these five animals were
born after the 1974 sylvatic YF wave had already
passed through MajÃ©.Other MajÃ©monkeys spe
cifically inhibiting YF virus antigen include two
marmosets, Saguinus geoffroyi, and one night
monkey Aotus trivirgatus. YF antibody was not

detected in plasmas from 33 adult Bradypus, 16
adult Choloepus or any other non-primate species
collected at MajÃ©4â€”26months after active YF
transmission there. At El Llano-CartI, another
forest locality which had suffered a sylvatic YF
wave within 6 months previous to collection of
plasmas, 9/15 adult howler monkey plasmas were
positive against YF virus, in contrast with none
of 10 adult Bradypus and none of three adult
Choloepus sloths.

from Aguacate which was attached to its seroneg
ative mother. The other was a radio-marked in
fant Choloepus at Cerro Azub; it developed spe
cHic PRN antibody against SLE virus between 17

September 1974, when its plasma titer was <1:8,
and 6 November, when the titer was 1:32. Its
mother also showed a significant rise in SLE an

by negative against the other three flaviviruses.

1:128 (range 1:32â€”1:512).AtAguacate, none of 14
Bradypus or 15 Choloepus was positive against

Mayaro virus.

DISCUSSION

Interpretation of these results is facilitated by
the paucity of flavivirus cross-reactions. Positive
tests were usually monospecific in all species cx
cept agoutis, and in the few cases of multiple pos
itives, titers were almost always clearly higher
against one particular flavivirus than against the
other three. The rarity of hetenologous flavivirus
reactions in sloths experimentally infected with

Our results support the working hypothesis that
New World sylvatic YF virus is a monkey virus.
No evidence was found to suggest alternate hosts.

Prolonged non-fatal experimental YF viremias of
high titer in B. variegatus have been uniformly
followed by the development of neutralizing an
tibody,1' but no neutralizing antibodies were de
tected in adult Bradypus from two areas recently
affected by sylvatic YF. Therefore, it is logical to
infer that if any Bradypus sloths were naturally
infected, their viremias were not long nor of high
titer, and that this species did not amplify the
transmission of YF virus.

On the other hand, our results indicate a high
prevalence of natural SLE virus infection in sloths
of both species. The vertebrate hosts in tropical
SLE cycles are not well understood. Previous iso
lations from tropical vertebrates include strains
from birds, an opposum, armadillos, two rodent
species and a three-toed sloth,20 and from mites
combed from a rice rat.2' At MajÃ©,specific anti
body against SLE virus was found more frequent
ly in sloths than in any other species or group of
vertebrates tested. By itself, this observation sug
gests that sloth antibody is useful as the best index
of the past occurrence of SLE virus in a given
area. However, in combination with the demon
stration of high prolonged SLE viremias in both
sloth species,'4 the serological evidence of natural
infection suggests that sloths are important natu
ral hosts of SLE virus. Their remarkable abun
dance in tropical forests is little recognized but is

epidemiologically important. Their density on
Barro Colorado Island in Panama has been esti

mated at 8.5 Bradypus and 1. 1 Choloepus pen
hectare,1 and our unpublished data using identical

techniques at Cerro Azul indicate similar densities
and proportions.

The lack of antibody against SLE virus in young
animals may be interpreted as evidence that sloths
are infected very infrequently, and gradually ac
cumulate a high percentage of positives in a pop
ulation only because of their long life span and
slow population turnover. However, lack of an
tibody in young animals may also be interpreted
as evidence that SLE virus had not been active in
the areas studied for 2 years or more. Little is
known of the epidemiology of Neotropical SLE
virus, and it may follow the pattern of intermit
tent waves or wandering foci as classically seen
for Neotnopical YF virus.22 In this case, dense
sloths populations would be important sources of
SLE virus. The recent isolation of SLE virus by
Dr. F. P. Pinheiro from a Brazilian Bradypus tn
dactylus is interesting in this respect.2Â°

The observations of antibody against ILH and

MAY viruses in agoutis D. punctata are intnigu
ing but difficult to interpret. Antibody against
MAY virus in howler monkeys agrees with pre
vious observations on the ecology of this virus.23
The high titers and lack of double positives at a
frequency higher than predicted by chance mdi
cate that the results are specific. ILH virus has
previously been isolated from binds in Panama.24

A final intriguing point found in these field re
sults is the apparently nearly simultaneous SLE
virus infections of the radio-marked Choloepus
mother-baby pair. Either they were both infected
by mosquito(es), or one infected the other with
SLE virus by contact or aerosol, as observed for
a baby Bnadypus and its experimentally infected
mother. â€˜@

Abstract. To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we
investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere
Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belong-
ing to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one
Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic
disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCR–positive bat species are considered
abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats. To our knowledge, this study is the first study
conducted in southeastern Mexico to identify DENV-2 in bats by a widely accepted RT-PCR protocol. The role that bats
play on DENV’s ecology remains undetermined.

Dengue fever is an important public health concern in the
tropics,1–4 and ecological and epidemiological studies are
needed to assess the role of bats and other mammals in a
possible sylvatic maintenance cycle.5 Dengue viruses (DENVs)
comprise four antigenically distinct but genetically related
serotypes of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family).1

DENVs are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that
cause one of the most common infectious diseases in humans
in tropical regions.2 Their transmission includes an urban
endemic/epidemic cycle between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
and humans as the reservoir host and a sylvatic enzootic cycle
between non-human primates and arboreal mosquitoes of the
genus Aedes.3 The urban cycle is well-documented in the Neo-
tropics, with four serotypes reported in urban areas,1–4 whereas
the sylvatic cycle has been shown in West Africa and peninsu-
lar Malaysia.5 Thus far, the sylvatic cycle has not been
described in the Neotropics. However, in Bolivia, DENV sero-
conversions among the indigenous Ayoreo people were found
in a remote area where Ae. aegypti, the primary vector, was
absent.6 This finding suggests a possible sylvatic cycle involving
a different mosquito species or cross-reaction with antibodies
to another flavivirus. In French Guiana, all four DENV sero-
types have been identified by molecular methods in 92 wild
mammals (bats, rodents, and marsupials) in all settings investi-
gated: periurban, rural, and sparsely populated areas.7 This
finding suggests that primarily urban DENV strains could
infect wildlife in non-urban forested areas.7 The role of wildlife
in DENV transmission remains unknown.
Bats are important reservoirs of many viruses, such as rabies

viruses, Nipah viruses, and coronaviruses.8–12 Flaviviridae are
the second most frequently reported viral family in the order
Chiroptera (13% frequency; second only to rhabdoviruses)9;
however, their role in the dynamics of DENVs remains poorly

understood. DENV have been reported in large frugivorous
bats (Pteropus genus) in Australia.13 More recently, polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) and antigen detection (direct immuno-
fluorescent assay) of DENV were described in bats from
DENV-endemic islands in China.14 Seroconversion in bats
(DENV-1, -2, and -3) has been reported in urban areas in
Costa Rica and Ecuador.15 Bats captured during a dengue
fever outbreak along the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of Mexico
were found to beDENV-seropositive (enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay [ELISA]), have DENV NS1 protein, and be
positive on reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR for DENV-2.16

Molecular evidence of DENV-1, -2, and -3 in bats from French
Guiana was reported, including a phylogenetic sequence from
a Carollia perspicillata bat consistent with DENV-1.7 Qualita-
tive detection of the NS1 antigen of DENVs in bat serum
samples and plaque reduction neutralization tests has been
reported in bats from southeasternMexico from disturbed sites
near human settlements in Campeche (S. Cabrera-Romo and
others, unpublished data) and Mérida,17 which is the largest
city in the Yucatan Peninsula.
In this study, samples were collected from bats trapped in

two biosphere reserves located in southeastern Mexico. High
bat diversity and large tracts of continuous forest characterize
these areas. Additionally, DENV-1, -2, and -4 have been
reported in human populations. The aim of this study was to
show the presence of DENV serotypes in bats within the
biosphere reserves and adjacent areas with anthropogenic
changes using RT-PCR. Bats were collected in Montes Azules
Biosphere Reserve (Chiapas; 16 °9¢46² N, 90 °41¢18² W)
and Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (Campeche; 18°26¢1² N,
89°36¢61² W) from two landscape types categorized as undis-
turbed forest (UD), comprised of primary forest with no
human disturbance, and disturbed forest (D), defined as a
transitional zone between primary forest and agricultural/
livestock areas or human settlements. In both regions, the sites
were located at least 20 km from significant human populations
where dengue has been reported (Xpujil in Campeche State
and Benemérito de la Américas in Chiapas State). Bats were

captured using four mist nets (5 + 9 m) in foraging sites. Nets
were opened at dusk and remained open for 4 consecutive
hours. Each site was sampled three times between November
of 2010 and August of 2011. Field guides were used for the
taxonomic species identification of all bats captured.18

In total, 146 bats were euthanized following the Guidelines
of the American Society of Mammalogists for the Use of Wild
Mammals in Research19 with the approval of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Subcommittee of the Veterinary Fac-
ulty of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. One hun-
dred forty-six spleen specimens were collected and preserved
in liquid nitrogen, and RNA from all samples was extracted
using TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RT-PCR was carried out for DENV (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4)
as described previously using highly specific and sensitive
primers.20 The DENV-positive control strains used in the
RT-PCR for DENVs (D1/AO/XX/1988 Angola, D2/CR/
13538/2007 Limón, D3/CR/14532/2007 Corredores, and D4/
DM/814669/1981 Dominica) were donated by the Dengue
Reference Center, Instituto Costarricense de Investigación y
Enseñanza en Nutrición y Salud (INCIENSA; Costa Rica).
Nuclease-free water was used as a negative control. RT-PCR
products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis
and stained with Gel Red (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). Pos-
itive and negative controls resulted as expected.
Samples from 16 bat species were analyzed. Six DENV-2–

positive bats were detected (prevalence of 4.1%; 95% confi-
dence interval ± 3.22) (Table 1). In Calakmul, four bats were
PCR-positive: two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus
jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus. Two bats, G. soricina and
A. jamaicensis, were captured in the UD sites, and two bats,
G. soricina and A. lituratus, were captured in a D site. In
Montes Azules, two A. lituratus were positive to DENV-2:
one bat from a UD site and one bat from a D site. These three
bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) are
considered highly abundant bat species in the Mexican Neo-
tropics,21–23 coinciding with the relative abundance found in
this study (A. lituratus: 179 [22%]; G. soricina: 118 [14.5%];

and A. jamaicensis: 111 [13.6%]). No significant difference
was detected comparing the presence of DENV-2 and the
type of site (UD and D) using a test of equal or given propor-
tions in R24 (c2 = 0.1738, degrees of freedom = 1, P = 0.6768).
This preliminary study provides additional evidence of

DENV exposure in Neotropical bats.7,15–17 Unfortunately,
because of sample degradation, we could not amplify a differ-
ent region of the viral genome for phylogenetic analysis from
the positive samples. Although DENV infection was sero-
logically recognized in 26 bats of the same three species
(A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and G. soricina) from Merida
City,17 this detection is the first detection of the DENV-2
genome by molecular diagnostic methods in bats from south-
eastern Mexico. DENV-1, -2, and -3 have been reported in
bats from French Guiana by RT-PCR, where DENV was
found in A. planirostris and C. perspicillata.7 Along the Gulf
Coast of Mexico, DENV-2 was identified in Myotis nigricans,
Carollia sowelli, andA. jamaicensis.16 However, this detection
is the first molecular detection of the DENV-2 genome in
A. lituratus and G. soricina.
Old World DENV-2 strains diverged relatively recently and

spread to the Neotropics by human carriers and the transpor-
tation of infected monkeys and mosquitoes.5 The encroach-
ment of human settlements and agricultural areas on UD
areas could promote new interactions among DENV vectors
and potential hosts, increasing the possible development of
sylvatic DENV.5 Large-scale research of anthropogenic change
and pathogen evolution using an epidemiologic framework is
vital to develop comprehensive policies across public health,
economic development, and conservation biology.5

This study adds additional evidence for the presence of
DENV-2 in three bat species (A. jamaicensis, A. lituratus,
and G. soricina). However, the extent to which bats are
involved in DENV transmission and their ability to act as
competent hosts remain undetermined. Because these species
are the three most abundant species in the region, we may be
seeing random spillover into dead-end hosts. Understanding
the ecology of DENV in bats is important before implicating
bats as a threat to public health. Sylvatic DENV in any species
could evolve from biological interactions between wild reser-
voirs and sylvatic vectors.5,7 Lastly, it may arise from socio-
economic factors, such as human encroachment into natural
areas in locations where medical and health services are
absent.25 Future investigations of DENV in Neotropical bats
and other potential wild reservoirs will improve the under-
standing of the ecological dynamics of these viruses in nature.

Tickborne 
Encephalitis 
in Naturally 

Exposed Monkey 
(Macaca sylvanus)

We describe tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in a monkey 
(Macaca sylvanus) after natural exposure in an area at risk 
for TBE. TBE virus was present in the brain and could be 
identifi ed as closely related to the European subtype, strain 
Neudoerfl .

Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is a zoonotic disease caused by TBE virus (TBEV), a fl avivirus. There are 
3 subtypes of TBEV, the European subtype, transmitted 
by the hard tick Ixodes ricinus, and the Far Eastern and 
Siberian subtypes. Except in Austria, where mass vaccina-
tion campaigns were organized, the incidence of TBE in 
humans has increased in the past 30 years in all European 
countries with regions with risk for the disease. The aver-
age increase of TBE in 10 European countries was 311% 
from 1974–1983 to 1994–2003 (1,2). In Germany TBE in-
cidence has increased enormously during recent years.

Most TBE group viruses use rodents as maintenance 
and amplifying hosts. TBE is predominately reported in hu-
mans, seldom in dogs and horses, and is as yet unknown in 
monkeys.The clinical progress of TBE is typically biphasic. 
In humans, a nonspecifi c infl uenzalike illness develops as 
the fi rst phase of illness 7-14 days after they are bitten by a 
TBEV-positive tick. A second phase, with central nervous 
system involvement, develops in ≈30% of patients. Initial 
signs and symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, and 
radiculitis. The case-fatality rate is 1%–2% in central Eu-
rope and 20%–40% in Siberia and the Far East.

The Study
On July 14, 2006, staggering paresis of the hind legs, 

incoordination, and intermittent opisthotonos developed in 
a female barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus). No nystag-
mus was present. The monkey, born April 27, 2005, was 

from a group of ≈200 animals living in 3 social groups. 
The animals were kept in a large, outdoor enclosure of a 
monkey park situated in a TBE-risk area in southern Ger-
many. Four days after the onset of clinical signs, the animal 
became comatose and was euthanized. Blood was collected 
before euthanasia, and serum was prepared.

At necropsy, no macroscopic lesions were observed. 
The brain was removed and immediately frozen on dry ice 
and sectioned in 2-cm slices. Alternating slices were placed 
in 3.5% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C. After 48 h, rep-
resentative areas, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, 
basal ganglia, and cerebellum, were embedded in paraffi n. 
Sections (3–5 μm) were cut from each block and stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin for standard histopathologic evalua-
tion. For immunohistochemical detection of TBEV antigens, 
a noncommercial rabbit polyclonal hyperimmune serum (di-
lution 1:1,000) was used as described previously (3).

Histologic examination of the brain tissue could be 
satisfactorily performed despite moderate artifacts caused 
by freezing (Figure, Panel A). Moderate perivascular in-
fl ammatory cuffs and slight diffuse infi ltration of brain pa-
renchyma by mononuclear cells were observed in almost 
all brain areas, including basal ganglia and cerebellum 
(Figure, Panel B). In addition, slight mononuclear infl am-
matory infi ltrates were present in the meninges. Microglial 
nodules were not detected. Immunohistochemical testing 
demonstrated several anti-TBEV immunoreactive neurons 
and processes, mainly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar 
cortex (Figure, Panel B), and to a lesser extent in pyrami-
dal neurons of the temporal cortex. Single neuronophagias 
were also observed.

From the frozen material, 10 samples of brain tissue 
were selected for PCR analysis, including cerebrum, cer-
ebellum, and brain stem (Table). Viral RNA was extracted 
from brain tissue with RNeasy Kit and from cerebrospinal 
fl uid  with QIAamp Viral Kit (both from QIAGEN, Hilden, 
Germany). The brain tissue was homogenized by bead-
milling (Retsch, Haan, Germany) with 3-mm stainless steel 
beads in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer, and the QIAshredder sys-
tem (QIAGEN) was used to improve homogenization. A 
modifi ed nested reverse transcription–PCR (nRT-PCR) was 
conducted with primer pairs Pp1, Pm1 (reverse transcrip-
tion and fi rst PCR), and Pp2, Pm2 (nested PCR) (4). Am-
plifi cation was done in a 50-μL reaction volume containing 
10 μL 5× buffer, 2 μL deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix 
(10 mmol/L), 2 μL enzyme mix (all from QIAGEN), 2 μL 
RNase inhibitor (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), 1.25 μL 
primers Pp1 and Pm1 (20 pmol/μL; Jena-Bioscience, Jena, 
Germany), 27.5 μL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)–treated 
water, and 4 μL RNA extract. The reaction was performed 
in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) thermal cycler for 
30 min at 60°C for RT and 15 min at 95°C for denaturation 
as the initial step, followed by 40 cycles of PCR with 30 s

at 94°C, 30 s at 66°C, and 1 min at 72°C. Final extension 
was 10 min at 72°C.

The second amplifi cation reaction was carried out with 
4 μL of amplifi cation product in a 50-μL reaction (25 μL 
Taq PCR Master Mix [QIAGEN], 1.25 μL of each primer 
Pp2 and Pm2 [20 pmol/μL], and 18.5 μL DEPC-treated wa-
ter). After a denaturation step of 2 min at 95°C, 30 cycles 
of 30 s at 94°C and 30 s at 65°C were performed, followed 
by 10 min at 72°C.

PCR products (178 bp) were visualized under UV 
light after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and ethid-
ium bromide staining. Bands were cut out, and DNA was 
extracted by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIA-
GEN). DNA sequencing was conducted by cycle sequenc-
ing, using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit 
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplifi cation primers Pp2 
and Pm2 were also used as sequencing primers. Nucleotide 
sequences were determined on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic 
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Six of the10 brain samples were positive and CSF was 
negative for TBEV by nRT-PCR (Table). The sequences of 
these 6 PCR products (178 bp) differed by only 1 nt from 

that of strain Neudoerfl , the prototype strain of the Euro-
pean virus subtype.

The serum was tested for whole specifi c TBE antibod-
ies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and IgM) by ELISA (5). Solid-
phase bound antigen and antigen conjugate were from a 
commercially available test kit (Immunozym FSME, Pro-
gen, Heidelberg, Germany). As standards, negative and 
positive test serum samples were used, and the following 
limit values were defi ned: <5 U/L, negative; 5–7 U/L, bor-
der line; 9–14 U/L, weakly positive; >14 U/L, positive; and 
>50 U/L, strongly positive. The serum of the macaque de-
scribed in this paper was positive for specifi c TBE antibod-
ies (24 U/L)

Conclusions
Experimental infections of macaques with TBEV and 

related fl aviviruses (Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Powas-
san virus) have been reported (6–8), but natural infections 
with TBE virus have not been reported previously. In our 
case, clinical signs, neuropathologic fi ndings, and immuno-
histochemical detection of TBEV antigen in neurons and of 
TBEV by nRT-PCR indicate that the macaque succumbed 
to natural TBEV infection. Although the classical multi-

nodular pattern of lesions in the brain was not observed, 
the distribution of viral antigens was comparable to that 
observed in fatal human TBEV infection with a short clini-
cal course. The TBEV was characterized as closely related 
to the European prototype strain Neudoerfl , which suggests 
that the infection was acquired locally by infected ticks. 
This fact is surprising because macaques generally quickly 
remove ticks during social grooming.

The monkey park where the animal became infected 
is situated in southern Germany, close to the Bodensee 
(Bodenseekreis). This area, fl anked on the west by an area 
at high risk for TBE (Kreis Konstanz), is also at risk for 
TBE. From 1999 to 2006, a total of 29 autochthonous clini-
cal cases of TBE in humans were reported in the Bodens-
eekreis and 35 in the Kreis Konstanz (Hellenbrand W., 
pers. comm.); 19% of unvaccinated forestry workers in the 
Bodenseekreis and 15% in the Kreis Konstanz were sero-
positive for TBEV (9). The prevalence of TBEV in ticks 
was 1.2%–2.3% in the Bodenseekreis (10).

Retrospective analyses of anamnestic data from the 
affected monkey park show that TBE may have appeared 
sporadically in macaques in the past. A monkey died in 
September 1995 and another in May 2006, and TBEV anti-
gen was subsequently detected in brain tissue from the fi rst 
animal and antibodies to TBEV were detected in both ani-
mals (12 U/L and 46 U/L, respectively, by ELISA). These 
2 cases have not been systematically evaluated. Clinical 
signs of encephalitis were observed in another animal in 
1999, but it seroconverted (42 U/L, ELISA test) and re-
covered after 2 months. Thus, TBE should be considered 
as a differential diagnosis in cases of encephalitis in mon-
keys kept outdoors in areas at risk for TBE. Further sero-
epidemiologic studies are planned to determine the status 
of TBEV infection among animals in this German monkey 
park. Vaccination against TBEV should be an option to 
protect other macaques in the group.

ntroduction

Over the past decades, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has become
growing public health concern in Europe and Asia and is the most

mportant viral tick-borne disease in Europe. It is also important
n the Far East and in other parts of Asia. Vaccination can effec-
ively prevent TBE. Protective vaccination is indicated for persons
nhabiting or visiting TBE areas who have an increased risk of tick
ites. For this purpose, it is necessary to know where TBE virus
ccurs, where vectors are a potential hazard, and where as a con-
equence autochthonous TBE cases have been registered. Unlike
yme borreliosis endemic regions, TBE risk areas are distributed in a
atchwork pattern, sometimes the situation remains stable, some-
imes changes occur due to altered climatic conditions or other
actors. This review is an update of an earlier one on the same topic

The principal vectors of TBE virus (TBEV) are the hard ticks Ixodes
icinus and I. persulcatus. I. ricinus has the primary role as a vec-

or of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus of TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib which
epresent different subtypes of TBEV. In some areas of Siberia and
he Far East, where I. persulcatus is not the predominant species,

physalis concinna, have been associated with local TBE outbreaks
(Nuttall and Labuda, 2005). In China, TBEV has been isolated from
H. concinna and I. ovatus.

Zoonotic tick-borne diseases are an increasing health burden
in Europe, and there is speculation that this is partly due to cli-
mate changes affecting vector biology and pathogen transmission
(Gray et al., 2009). Currently, individual aspects of tick activity
(Gray, 2008) and distribution (Danielová et al., 2008) as well as the
distribution of risk areas (Danielová et al., 2010) suggest an influ-
ence of the climate. The remarkably high host seeking activity of
I. ricinus in Berlin, Germany, in the winter 2006/07 was probably
due to a very mild winter (Dautel et al., 2008), and a retrospective
study suggests that hotter summers might change the dynamics
and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick
population becoming active in the later part of the year (Gray,
2008). However, the nature and significance of climate change
effects on the components of TBEV ecology have not yet been fully
determined.

It has been reported that ticks (I. ricinus) and TBEV reach higher
altitudes in the mountains, higher than in former years between
1970 and 1980 (Danielová et al., 2006; Materna et al., 2008; Daniel

et al., 2008a; Holzmann et al., 2009), and spread north in Sweden
(Lindgren et al., 2000; Lindgren and Jaenson, 2006; Eisen, 2008),
Norway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Finland (Jääskeläinen et al., 2006),
Germany (Hemmer et al., 2005; Süss et al., 2008a) and west in
Austria (Holzmann et al., 2009). Nearly all these data were collected

long the fringes of tick distribution and do not apply to the core

However, there are authors who dispute the influence of cli-
ate change on TBE risk areas based on the current state of

nowledge (Korenberg, 2009) or hold other factors (political and
ociological changes and human behaviour which influenced the
ick bite exposure of humans, vaccination acceptance) responsible
or the increase (or decrease) in TBE incidence (and/or distribu-
ion) (Randolph, 2008; Šumilo et al., 2007, 2008a,b; Süss et al.,
008b). Randolph and Rogers (2000) predicted that the expected
ummer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture might pro-
ressively drive the distribution of TBEV (Ixodes ticks) into higher
atitude and higher-altitude regions through the 2020s, 2050s, and
080s.

When previously undescribed risk areas are detected, it is often
ard to decide whether these areas had already existed previously
nd remained undetected due to the absence of humans or whether
hey have developed recently. Risk areas can be very large, but
hey can also be extremely small and contain special TBEV variants
Kupča et al., 2010).

The epidemiological knowledge of TBE should be updated from
ime to time to provide a solid basis for recommendations with
egard to protective vaccination.

For an understanding of the eco-epidemiology of TBEV, some
asic facts about the biology and ecology of the virus are first pre-
ented.

BE virus classification

Taxonomically, TBE viruses belong to the tick-borne viruses
ithin the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae (Fauquet et al.,

005). Most members of this virus genus are arthropod-borne. The
osquito-borne virus group of the genus Flavivirus includes medi-

ally important viruses such as Yellow fever virus, the 4 serotypes
f Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.
he group of tick-borne flaviviruses currently comprises 12 virus
pecies divided into 2 groups, mammalian and seabird group. In
he mammalian group, TBEV, but also the louping ill virus and the
owassan virus (POWV) as well as the closely related deer tick virus
ause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. The Kyasanur for-
st disease virus and the closely related Alkhurma virus as well as
he Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus, which have also been classi-
ed into this group, cause severe haemorrhagic disease in humans.
one of the other members of the virus group affecting mammals,

uch as the Kadam virus and the Royal farm virus, cause human
iseases and neither do the members of the sea bird virus group
Hubálek and Halouzka, 1996; Süss and Schrader, 2004; Gould and
olomon, 2008).

TBEV occurs in 3 subtypes, the European virus (previously CEE
irus, Central European encephalitis virus, TBEV-Eu), the Far East-
rn virus (previously RSSE virus, TBEV-Fe), and the Siberian virus
previously west Siberian virus, TBEV-Sib). TBEV-Eu is closely asso-
iated with I. ricinus and TBEV-Fe and TBEV-Sib with I. persulcatus.
ccording to Ecker et al. (1999), variation in amino acids within
subtype is up to 2% and between subtypes 5–6% (Lindquist and
apalahti, 2008).

All data gathered so far indicate that immunization of persons
n clinical trials with a vaccine based on the European subtype
virus strains Neudoerfl or K23) showed cross-protection against
he other 2 subtypes (Holzmann et al., 1992; Hayasaka et al., 2001;

akashima et al., 2001).

TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe, borne by I. persulcatus ticks, are mono-
hyletic (Tonteri et al., 2011). The diversity of the 2 TBEV species
arried by I. persulcatus is much higher than for TBEV-Eu and has
robably been evolving for thousands of years, whereas TBEV-Eu
Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 3

strains in I. ricinus are very similar, do not show clear geographic
clustering (i.e. strains within a given region do not form genetic
groups) and occur in most TBE-endemic countries (Kuno et al.,
1998; Haglund et al., 2003; Han et al., 2005; Jääskeläinen et al.,
2006; Grard et al., 2007; Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008). Recently,
Jääskeläinen et al. (2010a) isolated TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Fe strains
from I. persulcatus collected in the Republics of Karelia and Buryatia,
respectively.

TBEV-Eu, louping ill virus, and other flaviviruses transmitted
mainly by I. ricinus are closely related to each other. Inexact diag-
nostics for these closely related viruses can cause problems insofar
as apparent detections of TBEV may really be detection of louping ill
virus. This could be the case, for example, in Denmark and Norway
where louping ill virus and TBEV cocirculate.

I. ricinus occurs in large parts of Europe. It extends as far as
Turkey, northern Iran, and the Caucasus in the southeast. I. persul-
catus occurs in eastern Europe, Siberia and as far east as Japan and
China. There is an overlapping zone of I. ricinus with I. persulcatus
from the northern Baltics to the Urals.

The western border of the I. persulcatus distribution runs
through Latvia. Only I. ricinus occurs west of this border, while both
tick species occur east of it. Other transition zones can be found in
eastern Estonia, Karelia (Russia), and the St. Petersburg area.

Sequences of the TBEV-Eu subtype have been found in Latvian
I. ricinus and those of TBEV-Sib in Latvian I. persulcatus (Süss et al.,
2002). Such a boundary also exists at the border between Finland
and Russia with I. persulcatus occurring on the Russian side. With
the exception of one tick engorged on a migratory bird in Sweden
(Jaenson et al., 1994), I. persulcatus has never been detected in west-
ern or northern Europe until Jääskeläinen et al. (2006) detected I.
persulcatus and the Siberian virus subtype in the Kokkola region in
western Finland, 300 km south of the Arctic Circle, which was the
first finding of the TBEV-Sib in northern Europe.

Recently, Jääskeläinen et al. (2010b, 2011) identified a new TBE
endemic focus in Simo, Finnish Lapland, and an unusual combi-
nation of TBEV-Eu and I. persulcatus ticks in an area without any
evidence of the occurrence of both Ixodes tick species or any cocir-
culation of different TBEV subtypes.

In the TBEV-endemic areas in Russia, the 3 subtypes persist at
varying prevalences in ticks in individual geographic areas. Based
on the E-glycoprotein sequences, the Far Eastern subtype predom-
inates in the Far East (approximately 70%) along with the Siberian
subtype. In Central Russia, 90% of the isolates can be classified
as TBEV-Sib, the other isolates belonging to the TBEV-Fe group.
In addition, a small number of isolates of the TBEV-Eu could be
detected in I. persulcatus (Karan et al., 2010). In western Russia,
TBEV-Sib is predominant, followed in decreasing order by TBEV-
Fe and TBEV-Eu (Karan et al., 2010). For several regions in Russia
(e.g. Yekaterinburg and Kemerovo) it is suspected that within the
period from 1939 to 2009, TBEV-Fe has been replaced gradually by
TBEV-Sib.

In 1999, a large number of fatal cases of TBE characterized by an
unusual haemorrhagic syndrome were identified in the Novosibirsk
region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TBEV variants clustered
with TBEV-Fe, but not with TBEV-Sib, and that they also differed
from the already known Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus (Ternovoi
et al., 2003).

Unfortunately, the number of characterized TBEV strains and
isolates is very low. As an example, only a few isolates have been
obtained and fully identified in Germany so far, but all these sub-
strains of TBEV-Eu (Salem, Amberg) showed the highest homology

with the prototype strain Neudoerfl. The other 2 TBEV subtypes
have not been detected at all (Süss et al., 2008a; Kupča et al., 2010).

For Asia, with the exception of Japan, only a few strain char-
acterizations are available. Thus, TBEV-Fe is predominant in China
where it was isolated from the cerebral tissue of patients as well

s from ticks (Lu et al., 2008). In Japan, the Hokkaido isolate was
learly classified as TBEV-Fe (Takashima et al., 2001).

Surprisingly, TBEV sequences clustering with TBEV-Eu have
een found in wild rodents (Apodemus agrarius) in South Korea (Kim
t al., 2008; Yun et al., 2009).

In I. ricinus in Europe, TBEV prevalence in unfed ticks varies
etween 0.1 and 5% and increases during the tick development
rom stage to stage. Higher virus prevalences have been recorded in
ngorged ticks removed from humans (Bormane et al., 2004; Süss
t al., 2004) and also in unfed ticks in certain regions of the Baltic
tates (Latvia, Bormane et al., 2004). One hypothesis for this phe-
omenon could be the virus replication in cells of host blood in the
ick during and after the blood meal, but there is no experimental
vidence of this yet. Bormane et al. (2004) reported that the annual
ean infection rate with TBEV from 1993 to 2002 in field-collected

nfed I. ricinus adults varied between 1.7 and 26.6%.
In general, TBEV prevalences in I. persulcatus seem to be higher

han in I. ricinus. Bormane et al. (2004) detected TBEV prevalence
ates between 0 and 37.3% in adult I. persulcatus.

iology of TBE virus transmission

TBEV circulates within a ‘parasitic triangle’ of interactions
etween virus, vector ticks, and tick hosts and is able to persist

n a given habitat over long periods of time (Nuttall, 1999).
The occurrence of vector ticks and suitable vertebrates on

hich ticks can become infected are crucial for virus existence
n a given area. The following mechanisms of virus transmission
etween ticks occur: (i) feeding/cofeeding (Labuda et al., 1993a,b),
ii) transovarial transmission, and perhaps (iii) sexual transmis-
ion. Cofeeding transmission is especially effective, and the virus
an be transmitted through this mechanism from a feeding vector
ick to cofeeding ticks even on immune hosts, while transovarial
ransmission is considerably less efficient.

ransmission hosts

I. ricinus feeds on many species of mammals, birds, and reptiles.
n contrast, the number of transmission hosts for TBEV classified so
ar is low. The host species that sustain the transmission cycle of
BEV are partly determined by the host preference of the involved
ector tick(s). A given reservoir host for TBEV must fulfil numerous
equirements when infected.

The outcome of human infection depends on the virus tropism
e.g. the neurotropism), the virus subtype and its pathogenic poten-
ial, on the immune status of the host, its age, and its genetic
usceptibility to infection. During the infection process, virus fusion
ith the host cell membrane is an essential and highly complex
rocess. Membrane fusion by the TBEV is triggered by the mildly
cidic pH of the endosome and is mediated through the enve-
ope glycoprotein E, a class II viral fusion protein (Rey et al., 1995;
tiasny et al., 2002). During the viraemic phase, many extraneu-
al tissues are infected (Monath and Heinz, 1996). Haematogenic
pread allows different organs to be infected (spleen, liver, bone
arrow) (Haglund and Günther, 2003). During this phase of the

linical course in patients, the virus crosses the blood–brain barrier
o invade the central nervous system (CNS) (Dumpis et al., 1999).
iral replication in the CNS causes lysis of cells, inflammation, and
ellular dysfunction (Dumpis et al., 1999; Maximova et al., 2009).
he neuropathogenesis of TBE is a complex of interactions between
he TBEV and a number of host factors that trigger the susceptibil-

ty to infection and the capacity for an effective antiviral response
Ružek et al., 2009; Maximova et al., 2009). Encephalitis during a
BEV infection has an immunopathological basis.

There is a tendency for the 3 developmental stages of I. ricinus
o feed on different kinds of host. Larvae feed on animals of all
iseases 2 (2011) 2–15

sizes, nymphs mainly on medium-sized to large hosts, and adults
are limited to medium-sized and large hosts. There is much over-
lap between the hosts of larvae and nymphs. Certain small mammal
species act as the main transmission hosts, in that they are able to
transmit the virus via viraemia to feeding ticks and also by cofeed-
ing. The rodents Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, and Myodes spp.
are important as reservoir hosts for TBEV-Eu in Europe, A. agrar-
ius and A. peninsula for TBEV-Sib in Siberia, and Myodes rufocanus
and Microtus arvalis for TBEV-Fe in the Far East. Waldenström et al.
(2007) found that some ticks attached to birds in Sweden carried
TBEV. However, the TBEV prevalence in such ticks was over than the
prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, detected with com-
parable methodologies, and little is known about the capability
of birds of functioning as reservoirs of TBEV (Waldenström et al.,
2007).

TBEV infections may be amplified to significant levels as a result
of the aggregated questing and feeding behaviour of the vector tick
larvae (Labuda et al., 1993a). At the end of the blood meal, the larva
detaches from the host, moults, and develops into a virus-infected
nymph that can in turn transmit the virus to its host. Since most
transmission hosts are not suitable for the adult stage to feed on,
larvae and nymphs are of special importance for TBEV transmission.

The development of I. ricinus from one generation to the next
(egg to egg) can take as long as 2–6 years, but averages 3 years
(Gray, 1991) and within this long time period, the virus can persist
in the various tick stages and can also be transmitted.

Even if the virus can infect a particular animal and replicate
and disseminate in this host, this does not mean that the host is
effective in transmitting the virus to feeding ticks. The viraemia
of TBEV-infected goats, for example, is generally very short and
of low intensity but this differs from animal to animal. Also, the
time course of the shedding of the virus in goat milk is very short,
between 2 and 8 days (Balogh et al., 2011).

Cofeeding transmission

Transmission between cofeeding ticks can occur in the absence
of systemic viraemia in the host. If different developmental stages
of I. ricinus feed in close proximity to each other, for example, on
the ear of a mouse, the virus is, as a rule, transmitted directly from
infected ticks to other (co-)feeding ticks. As the virus is transmit-
ted directly, this mechanism is also very effective if the host has
already developed neutralizing antibodies (Labuda et al., 1993a,b,
1997). According to the present state of knowledge and based on
very sophisticated data, ecoepidemiologically cofeeding transmis-
sion seems to be more common than viraemic transmission of
TBEV. Labuda et al. (1996) revealed viral antigen in both migratory
Langerhans cells and neutrophils. Also, migratory macrophages
were shown to produce infectious virus. According to these results,
the skin site of tick feeding is an important focus of viral replication
early after TBEV transmission.

Alimentary transmission

The main route of TBEV infection of humans is a tick bite; much
more rarely, the infection was transmitted by the alimentary route
involving dairy products from livestock.

Large domestic animals such as goats, sheep, and cattle are
potential hosts for I. ricinus and may become infected by TBEV in
endemic areas. These animals are viraemic over a very short period
only and, as a rule, do not any show clinical symptoms. However,

goats and sheep, more rarely cattle, are of special importance for
the so-called alimentary acquired TBE. During the viraemic stage,
the virus is excreted in milk and can be ingested orally by con-
sumption of non-pasteurized milk or cheese produced from raw
milk. The occurrence of individual cases or of small clusters of cases

J. Süss / Ticks and Tick-

n humans (e.g. in connection with holidays on a farm) may be
he consequence. The clinical course of alimentary TBE is usually

ore often biphasic than that of TBE induced by tick bite, in which
nly 20–30% of the patients show a 2nd phase in the course of dis-
ase. TBE in humans caused by virus-infected milk has increased
ver the past decades in Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rus-
ia, Albania, Austria, Czech Republic, and Hungary (Blaškovič, 1954;
an Tongeren, 1955; Gresíková, 1958a,b; Levkovich and Pogodina,
958; Gresíková and Řeháček, 1959; Nosek et al., 1967; Gresíková
t al., 1975; Kohl et al., 1996; Matuszczyk et al., 1997; Labuda et al.,
002; Kerbo et al., 2005; Leutloff et al., 2006; Balogh et al., 2009;
olzmann et al., 2009; Kříž et al., 2009). Clinical cases of alimentary
BE have not been reported from Germany and Switzerland during
he last few decades.

In addition to transmission by tick bites and alimentary trans-
ission, other routes of transmission have been described, e.g.

aboratory infections (Avšič-Županc et al., 1995), blood transfusions
Wahlberg et al., 1989), slaughtering of a viraemic goat (Kräusler,
981), and transmission from a viraemic mother to her baby by
reast milk (Vaisviliene, 1997).

oinfections

It has been known for a long time that Ixodes species can
arry several different pathogens at the same time, which they
an also transmit to the host, e.g. TBEV, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
ato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia spp. It has also been
hown that not only can simultaneous pathogen transmission dur-
ng the blood meal occur, but that the host can also develop
imultaneous clinical infections caused by different pathogens. Dif-
erent pathogens in the same tick do not usually interfere with each
ther, because they usually occupy certain different organs, tis-
ues, or even cell structures that serve as specific ecological niches
pathogens may be (i) mainly extracellular, (ii) mainly intracellular,
nd (iii) both extra- and intracellular]. An overview of some of the
ssues arising from mixed infections transmitted by ixodid ticks has
een provided by Korenberg (2004).

hanges in TBE epidemiology since 1990

Over the past decades, TBE has become a growing public health
oncern in Europe and other parts of the world (Süss, 2003, 2008;
unze and ISW-TBE, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010).

TBEV is endemic in areas extending from central and Eastern
urope to Siberia and parts of Asia. More and more TBEV endemic
reas are being detected, especially in Asia, and therefore a large
umber of new data must be expected.

TBEV occurs in central Europe, the Baltic and Scandinavian
ountries, and the Russian Federation. There are low-risk areas,
or example, in Finland and Norway, with a trend towards both
n expansion of risk areas and an increase in incidence. New
oci have emerged in Denmark (Fomsgaard et al., 2009), Finland
Jääskeläinen et al., 2010b, 2011), Sweden (Burenhult et al., 2002),
orway (Skarpaas et al., 2006), Austria (Walder et al., 2008),
ermany (Süss et al., 2008b), and Switzerland (Krech, 2002).

Table 1 summarizes the number of human TBE cases from
990 to 2009 in European countries with reliable epidemiologi-
al information. TBE is notifiable in 15 of these countries. Over the
ast 20 years, a total of 169,937 clinical cases of TBE have been
egistered in Europe and Russia, with morbidity being subject to

ather extreme fluctuations between countries and over time. In the
eriod of observation, morbidity was highest in 1996 with 12,733
eported cases and lowest in 2008 with 5352 cases. There have
een no known autochthonous cases in Belgium, Portugal, Spain,
K, Ireland, or the Netherlands. Ta

Fig. 1a shows the number of human TBE cases in Europe from
990 to 2009, Fig. 1b without the Russian cases, and Fig. 1c the
umber of TBE cases in Russia alone.

Surprisingly, the overall incidence of TBE in 7 countries in
urope increased to a very high level in 2006 (Daniel et al.,
008b). The exact reasons for these fluctuations are not fully under-
tood. In view of their short-term nature, a direct influence of
limate change and vaccination coverage appears unlikely. The
xplanation of Randolph et al. (2008), who analyzed data from 8

ountries (Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Poland,
ithuania, Estonia, Latvia), involves human behavioural responses
o weather favourable for outdoor recreational activities, includ-
ng mushroom and berry harvesting, differentially influenced by
ational cultural practices and economic constraints. Daniel et al.
iseases 2 (2011) 2–15

(2008a) comes to the conclusion that the epidemiological situa-
tion of TBE in the Czech Republic in 2006 was obviously affected
by 2 main factors – persisting host-seeking activity of I. ricinus in
the autumn and increased tick-bite risk in the mushroom picking
season.

In 2009, increases in TBE incidence outside the range (±1
standard deviation) over recent 5 years were seen in Lithuania,
Latvia, and Poland; higher numbers, but not statistically sig-
nificant occurred in the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Slovenia;
slightly higher numbers than usual (apart from 2005 to 2006) were
reported from Germany.

Based on preliminary data, in Europe registered 7226 human
cases of TBE in 2009 – 3721 (51.5%) of these in Russia alone. In
2008, 5352 cases had been registered in Europe – 2817 (52.6%) of
them in Russia.

In some central European countries (Poland, Germany, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, and Switzerland), the number of human TBE
cases increased during the last 2 decades. The increase in TBE inci-
dence shows a mean of 892 annual cases from 1990 to 1999 and a
mean of 1382 annual cases from 2000 to 2009.

Key epidemiological concepts

Unfortunately, country data are not fully comparable because,
even though many countries with mandatory notification use a
case definition based on clinical and laboratory data, these defi-
nitions vary between countries. Other endemic countries such as
Switzerland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Norway do not
have a formal case definition at all. Epidemiological data would be
comparable more directly if, at least at the European level, endemic
countries were to use a common TBE case definition and a com-
mon definition of what should be considered an endemic area. To
get developments in this direction underway, a European working
group has developed a definition for both of these concepts (Süss
et al., 2010).

Endemic area definition

An area endemic for TBEV is defined as an area with proven TBEV
circulation between ticks and vertebrate hosts as determined by the
detection of TBEV or the confirmation of autochthonous infections
in animals or humans in the past 20 years. The development of a
natural TBE focus depends on a variety of factors, including the pop-
ulation dynamics of vector ticks and there hosts and the presence
of susceptible host species.

However, the reason for the patchy distribution of TBE is not
quite clear. Korenberg (2009) summarizes a large number of pos-
sible factors influencing the manifestation of a natural TBE focus,
including virus prevalence in ticks, vector occurrence, and host
activity as well as socio-economic and climate changes.

Endemic areas of TBEV can only be characterized exactly, if all
direct (virus isolation from ticks and small rodents) and indirect
(serological detection of TBEV in animals, autochthonous human
cases) specific virus detections within a complex natural focus were
analyzed (Leutloff et al., 2006; Klaus et al., 2009; Holzmann et al.,
2009). Klaus et al. (2010a) demonstrated this using as an example
the natural focus of Salem, district Bodenseekreis, Germany.

In this area, TBEV was detected due to the occurrence of
autochthonous clinical TBE cases in humans. In 2006, a clinical TBE
case in a monkey (Macaca sylvanus) of the Salem monkey park was

confirmed, the TBEV strain Salem (substrain of Neudoerfl prototype
virus) was isolated from the brain of this animal and retrospective
analysis of anamnestic data from monkeys showed that TBE may
already have appeared sporadically in macaques in the past (Süss
et al., 2007). To characterize this endemic area further, the sero-

J. Süss / Ticks and Tick-

revalence in monkeys of this colony (283 animals) was assessed
nd was found to be 2.6%. Sheep of a migratory flock in the direct
urroundings of the monkey enclosure showed a TBEV seropreva-
ence of 9.0% (neutralization assay). However, no TBEV-RNA was
ound in (a small number of) ticks collected in this area.

In conclusion, the seroprevalence in free-ranging animals and
he prevalence of TBEV in hosts can, together with human and
nimal clinical TBE cases, provide further information on the eco-
pidemiological situation and help describe the TBE risk in a defined
rea, especially if the TBEV prevalence in ticks is low (Klaus et al.,
010a,b).

Within its geographic range, the virus is not equally distributed;
nstead, it tends to occur patchily in local foci (Blaškovič and Nosek,
972; Jusatz, 1978; Kunz, 1992; Süss et al., 1992; Kupča et al., 2010).
ecently, Kupča et al. (2010) described a TBE focus considering the
emporal and spatial dynamics of the respective TBEV in its vector
icks as well as its isolation and molecular characteristics. Within a
ery small area, an unusually high number (9 cases) and – what
s more important – severe cases of disease with fatal outcome
3 cases) occurred. The authors were able to isolate a TBEV strain
nd suggested after molecular analysis that the genomic changes
etected in this local virus strain may play a role in this unusual
lustering of severe infections.

In general, TBE risk maps cannot be regarded as 100% accurate
ue to the technical difficulties of precisely determining the site of
documented infection. Not only are people mobile, but so are the
osts (e.g. birds, deer). These animals may transport virus-infected
ngorged ticks to other parts of a given habitat (Waldenström et al.,
007). Endemic foci can shift within a given area.

In addition to this definition of what is an endemic area, a further
efinition is in official use in Germany. A given district is a TBE risk
rea if the number of confirmed TBE cases in a five-year period
n that district or in the district region (the given district plus all
he adjacent districts) is significantly higher than the number of
xpected cases given the incidence is 1 per 100,000 (Anonymous,
007).

BE case definition

According to Nuttall and Labuda (2005) the incidence of clini-
ally expressed forms of human TBE is dependent on 4 main factors:

(i) degree of exposure to infected ticks,
(ii) infection prevalence in ticks, which varies in different years

and in different regions, ranging from <0.1 to 5% in Europe and
from 4 to 39% in Asia,

iii) concentration of infectious virus in ticks; most people receive
bites from ticks carrying low doses of virus, and only about 15%
are bitten by highly infected ticks,

iv) virulence of the infecting TBEV strain.

Thus, an estimated one clinical case occurs for every 100 people
itten by ticks in regions of TBE endemicity. These calculations cor-
elate well with 1.4% of people who develop TBE after knowingly
eing bitten by a tick.

The definition of what should be considered a case of TBE as
greed between the members of the ISW-TBE working group is
ased on the clinical picture of TBE, its serological diagnosis, and
pidemiological factors (Süss et al., 2010).

(i) Clinically, TBE often takes a biphasic course with flu-like

ymptoms during the first phase, a subsequent asymptomatic
eriod without fever, and signs of meningitis, encephalitis, radiculi-
is, or mixed forms of any of these symptoms in the second phase.
ii) The serological diagnosis relies on the detection of TBEV-specific
mmunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies in serum, detection
Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 7

of TBEV-specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and an
increased CSF:serum index. Cross-reactive antibodies against other
flaviviruses to which the patient might have been exposed to or
been vaccinated against must be ruled out by performing a neu-
tralization test.

Epidemiological data include the history of exposure, the
patient’s vaccination status, the history of a tick bite, and the pos-
sible consumption of raw milk in risk areas.

Descriptive country-by-country TBE epidemiology

TBE is endemic in 27 European countries as well as in Asia,
notably in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and
South Korea.

Europe

Detailed maps of TBE endemicity and descriptions of risk areas
are helpful for inhabitants and travellers in order to identify the
geographic risk. Based on these data, active immunization is the
most effective tool for TBE prevention (Rendi-Wagner, 2004).

If we additionally consider TBE incidence (number of TBE cases
per 100,000 inhabitants per year, in this case based on the number
of inhabitants in 2008) in 2005–2009, the most important European
countries where vaccination is highly recommended for all persons
who plan a vacation involving contact with nature, are (in descend-
ing order of TBE incidence in the whole country) Slovenia (14.07),
Estonia (11.10), Lithuania (10.59), Latvia (8.76), the Czech Republic
(7.02), Switzerland (2.15), Sweden (1.99), Slovakia (1.16), Austria
(0.94, but see section on Austria below!), Poland (0.66), Hungary
(0.60), Germany (0.44), and Finland (0.39). Russia has one of the
highest TBE incidences (whole country), however, there are large
endemic, but also large non-endemic areas.

TBE risk occurs in other countries also, but is variable. Thus,
almost the entire country of Norway can presently be visited
without being exposed to a TBE risk; only one small focus exists
at the southern tip of the country with TBEV-infected ticks and
some human cases, which should not be entered unvaccinated. In
Sweden, there are many non-risk areas, but also distinct known risk
areas in a patchy distribution.

Special problems are faced by travellers living in non-risk coun-
tries visiting risk areas and return to their countries of origin, in
some cases during the incubation period of TBE. Thus, 5 known
cases of clinical TBE were registered in the USA from 2001 to 2008
where exposure and infection had taken place in Eastern Russia,
Siberia, Sweden, China, and the Czech Republic (Granger et al.,
2010). This publication shows that TBE in non-endemic regions
(New World) is usually registered as an Old World and Asian disease
problem.

Natural foci are found throughout Albania, but according to early
reports, endemic areas are concentrated in the southern districts of
Pėrmet and Gjirokastėr. These reports show a TBEV antibody preva-
lence of 22% in selected sera of farmers. Alimentary cases of TBE
have also been reported. Before 1990, 25 new cases were registered
every year (Eltari, 1991). Since then, no data have been published.

Austria
Before the annual TBE vaccination campaign was introduced in
1981, Austria had the highest recorded TBE morbidity in Europe,
with up to 700 hospitalized cases per year (Kunz, 2002, 2003).
The increase in vaccination coverage since 1981 has led to a

Fig. 2. TBE cases in Austria from 1979 to 2009 (data from the Insti

teady decline in TBE incidence (Fig. 2). In 2008, 88% of Aus-
rians had received at least one TBE vaccination, and 67% were
ithin the officially recommended vaccination schedule (Kunze

nd ISW-TBE, 2008a,b). Fig. 2 shows the influence of this very high
accination coverage, namely a drastic reduction of the number
f TBE cases since the beginning of the mass vaccination cam-
aigns. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a mean of 74 cases were
eported annually, an incidence rate of 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants
Virusepidemiologische Information, 2009). In 2009, 79 cases were
egistered.

The regions most affected by TBE are the provinces of Styria,
arinthia, and Upper Austria, the southern part of Vienna, and parts
f the Burgenland. In 2003, new endemic areas were described in
he region around Mattsee, Wallersee, and Thalgau north of the
ity of Salzburg. New risk areas have also been found in the Inntal
nd the Zillertal as well as in Vorarlberg, notably in the surround-
ngs of Feldkirch. In 2008, a series of TBE cases due to milk-borne
ransmission demonstrated for the first time that I. ricinus, the TBEV
ector, is present at altitudes of more than 1500 m above sea level
Holzmann et al., 2009).

On the basis of epidemiological data available from Austria due
o an excellent TBE surveillance system that has been in place for
he last 30 years, the considerable risk of acquiring TBE of about

per 10,000 man-months of tick exposure can be estimated for
n unvaccinated tourist staying for 4 weeks in a highly endemic
rovince (Styria, southern Austria) (Rendi-Wagner, 2004).

Based on the number of tourist overnight-stays in Austria during
he summer, about 60 travel-associated cases of clinical TBE can be
xpected to occur among unvaccinated visitors to Austria (Rendi-
agner, 2004). The high risk of contracting TBE in many areas of

ustria is masked by the high vaccination coverage of the Aus-
rian population, which, despite the continuously high prevalence
f TBEV in ticks, has led to a substantial reduction in disease burden.

ered risk areas. The highest TBE incidence is found in the Brest and
Grodno oblasts, followed by Minsk City. In 2003, 25 clinical cases
were reported in the area of Minsk (Karaban et al., 2009).

In the decade 1998 and 2007, the number of registered cases
ranged from 19 in 2002 (incidence rate, 0.18 per 100,000) to 108
in 2006 (1.11 per 100,000). Overall, 523 cases were registered from
1998 to 2007, corresponding to a mean annual case number of 52
(Karaban et al., 2009).

Between 10 and 15% of all cases registered from 1998 to 2007
concerned children younger than 14 years (Karaban et al., 2009)
– a proportion substantially lower than in the 1970s, when con-
sumption of raw goat milk was considerably higher than it is today.
Despite the high level of endemic TBE, information on clinical cases
in Belarus is scarce.

Bosnia

Even though there have been some cases in the northern parts of
the country, including alimentary infections, details have not been
published (Süss, 2003).

Croatia

Previously, only one natural focus in the northern part of the
country was described, between the rivers Sava and Drava (Zagreb,
Koprivnica) (Borcic et al., 1999). Around Križevci and in the north-
east of Osijek, the risk of infection seems very high. Other ‘new’ risk
areas occur along the Adriatic coast and on islands between Istria
and Dubrovnik in the south. From 1998 to 2007, the annual number
of cases ranged from 12 to 38. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a
mean of 24 cases were reported annually.

Czech Republic
TBEV is endemic in all parts of the country. From 2003 to 2009,
the annual average was 681 autochthonous cases.

In the Czech Republic, there is a high risk of acquiring a TBE
infection by tick bite. TBE incidence is higher in regions south of

latently persisted in areas where no cases occurred over prolonged
periods (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). Another interesting
feature is the occurrence of single cases in Saarland and Rhineland-
Palatinate in southwestern Germany. Outside the risk areas in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and Thuringia, more than 5%

rague, near the city of České Budějovice, and around Brno. Also,
isease incidence has been high near the town of Plzeň in the west-
rn part of the country. Recently, TBE foci have also been identified
n the northern part of the province of Bohemia. In the east of the
ountry, incidence has been high in the area of Olomouc. Clinical
ases of TBE are notified between April and November every year,
ith a peak in July (Beran, 2004).

Recent reports suggest that the altitude distribution limits of
oth I. ricinus and TBEV have changed from 700 m to about 1200 m
bove sea level, notably in the Giant Mountains (Danielová et al.,
006; Materna et al., 2008).

Currently, the alimentary route of transmission of TBEV
ccounts for only 0.9% of cases (Beneš, 2006). From 1997 to 2008,
total of 64 clinical cases of alimentary TBEV transmission were

eported.

enmark

The island of Bornholm has long been known for being a TBE
isk area. From 2001 to 2008, 30 patients with TBE were diagnosed
n Denmark. A total of 22 acquired the infection on the island of
ornholm and 8 during visits to other well-known TBE-endemic
reas outside Denmark (Laursen and Knudsen, 2003; Mølbak et al.,
009). In 2008, one clinical case was reported (Mølbak et al., 2009).
rom 2008 to 2009, the first 2 TBE cases acquired outside Born-
olm were reported, both in North Zealand (Fomsgaard et al.,
009).

The level of TBEV prevalence in ticks on Bornholm is similar to
hat seen in other European countries where TBEV is endemic. On
he island of Bornholm, TBEV and the louping ill flavivirus have
een found to coexist in I. ricinus (Jensen et al., 2004).

stonia

In Estonia, infection with TBEV can occur across the country,
ith both of its main vectors, I. ricinus and I. persulcatus, present

nd carrying the virus.
TBE cases have been registered in each of the 17 administra-

ive districts of the country. However, the risk of infection varies
etween regions, as reflected in the mean incidence rates. For
xample, from 2000 to 2007, incidence rates ranged from 30 to 83
er 100,000 in Saaremaa–the highest level of morbidity through-
ut Estonia, whereas incidence rates in Ida-Virumaa were from 9
o 45 and in the range of 20 in Hiumaa, 16 in Vörumaa, and 6 in
allin and surroundings (Vasilenko et al., 2002; Epstein and Kutsar,
009).

Countrywide, the highest incidence rates were noted in 1997
27.8 per 100,000). From 2004 to 2007, incidence rates ranged from
0.4 to 13.5. From 2004 to 2008, the average number of TBE cases
eported in Estonia was 149. By 2008, the incidence rate (6.7) had
eturned to the level observed in the early 1990s (6.5). In 2009, 179
ases of TBE were registered (Epstein and Kutsar, 2009).

The highest morbidity (53.5%) in this period was among people
ver the age of 40. The proportion of TBE cases in children aged
–14 years was 16.0%. The percentage of cases transmitted via the
limentary route was 2.2% in 2004, 29.3% in 2005, and 8.8% in 2006.
n 2007 and 2008, no alimentary cases were reported (Epstein and
utsar, 2009).

inland
In Finland, a record number of 41 cases were registered in 2000
Han et al., 2002). From 2004 to 2008, an average of 22 cases was
eported annually. So, in Finland, the incidence of clinical disease is
ow. The known endemic areas are situated mainly in Åland (66% of
Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 9

125 cases reported from 1987 to 1997, 80 per 100,000 population
in 2000), on the archipelago of Turku (10%), and in the Kokkola (6%)
and Lappeenranta regions (5%). The coastal areas of Turku and Kum-
linge island (Åland archipelago) bear the highest risk of infection.
Anti-TBEV antibody analyses suggest that 1 in 5 Ålanders becomes
infected during his or her lifetime. Cases have also been identified
on an island close to the city of Helsinki (Han et al., 2001). Two
new endemic areas were identified recently, i.e., Varkaus in the
east and Simo on the Gulf of Bothnia, 100 km south of the Arctic
circle, so far the northernmost TBE risk areas (Jääskeläinen et al.,
2010a).

France

Some cases have been reported from the Alsace region, and sin-
gle cases of TBE infection have been documented from the region
of Nancy, Lorraine. New cases have been reported recently from
Faverges and Grenoble (Süss, 2003). From 2000 to 2009, 38 clinical
cases of TBE were registered.

Germany

Since 1992, usually between 100 and 300 autochthonous clini-
cal TBE cases were recorded annually (Fig. 3). There is no trend of
change since 2000 apart from 2 unusually high years in 2005 and
2006. An all-time high was reached in 2005, when 431 cases were
reported. This was exceeded by an additional increase in 2006 with
546 cases. In recent years, a decrease in reported cases was seen,
with 238 cases in 2007, 285 cases in 2008, and 314 cases in 2009.
From 2004 to 2008, the average number of reported cases was 355
(Anonymous, 2004–2008).

The highest numbers of autochthonic TBE cases were seen
in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, with 2454 cases registered
2001–2009 (85.9% of all cases in Germany). These Federal States
were followed by Hesse with 190 cases (6.6%) and Thuringia with
40 cases (1.4%). In the remaining 11 Federal States (with the excep-
tion of Bremen), isolated cases were registered but did not lead to
a classification of the respective district as risk area. Interestingly,
isolated cases were also diagnosed in northern Germany, in areas
where no TBE cases had been detected previously (Hamburg, Lower
Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein). The virus also seems to have

f all registered clinical TBE cases were reported from ‘non-risk’
reas.

Whereas the incidence of TBE in Baden-Wuerttemberg and
avaria has remained on a consistently high level for years, increas-

ng incidences have been reported in other areas of Germany, such
s the Odenwald (Süss et al., 2004).

Currently, 136 of the 440 German districts are classified as TBE
isk areas. In 2009, 3 new risk areas, i.e., Unterallgäu, Oberallgäu,
nd Memmingen, were identified (Anonymous, 2010).

reece

In Greece, isolated clinical cases of TBE have been reported in the
orth of the country, in the Thessaloniki region. A 2007 study by
avlidou et al. provided detailed seroprevalence data (ELISA-IgG) in
ealthy blood donors from the northern parts of the country. Thus,
.8% of unvaccinated volunteers in the province of Chalkidiki, 3.6%

n Evros, 2.7% in Imathia, 2.4% in Kastoria, 1.6% in Kaval, 5.4% in
ell, and 2.9% in Xanthi were IgG-positive (Pavlidou et al., 2007).
owever, these data were not confirmed by neutralization test,
nd so, these serological data could refer to Greek goat encephalitis
irus.

ungary

The average yearly incidence rate from 1977 to 1996 was 2.5 per
00,000 inhabitants (range 1.3–3.8), with the highest incidences
rom 1981 to 1990. From 1997 to 2002, a significant decrease in
he number of registered TBE cases was observed, with an incidence
ate of 0.5 per 100,000 in 2000. From 2004 to 2008, an average of
6 cases was reported annually. In 2009, 64 cases were reported
Balogh et al., 2009).

Extended high-risk areas are located in western Hungary and
long the Danube, i.e. in the counties of Zala, Somogy, and
as (western Hungary), Nógrád (northern Hungary), and around
ake Balaton (National Institute of Health, Budapest, Hungary,
007).

The significance of alimentary route of the TBEV has again
een illustrated by an event observed in Hungary in 2007. In
akhegy, western Hungary, 31 of 154 persons having consumed
on-pasteurized goat milk developed clinically manifest TBE; in 25
f the 31 patients, TBE was also detected serologically (Balogh et al.,
009).

taly

A few clinical cases have been recorded in northern Italy in the
rea of Florence, Trento, and Belluno. Anti-TBEV antibodies have
een found in about 1% of persons exposed to potential risk, such
s foresters, hunters, woodcutters, and gamekeepers (Cristofolini
t al., 1993). In 2006, the first cases were reported in Friuli Venezia
iulia, with one taking a lethal course (Ruscio, 2009). Since the
arly 1990s, 2–34 cases were reported annually, with 23 cases in
004, 14 in 2006, 34 in 2008, and 32 in 2009. The natural foci in

taly continue to remain endemic at low incidence levels, but with
trend upwards. Thus, 1990–2000, a mean of 6 cases of TBE were

eported annually; 2001–2009, a mean annual number of 19 cases
as registered (D’Ágaro et al., 2009).

atvia
From 1990 to 2000, Latvia was a country with one of the high-
st TBE incidences in the world. Since then, the annual number
f reported cases has dropped considerably from an average of
59 cases 1990–1994 to an average of 243 cases from 2001 to
005. 2004–2008, a mean of 183 cases annually were reported.
iseases 2 (2011) 2–15

In 2009, 328 cases were registered (EpiNorth Database, 2010). In
1993, annual incidence rates quadrupled compared to the mean
level of the previous 2 decades (nearly 8 cases per 100,000 pop-
ulation), reaching the highest levels in 1994 and 1995 at 53 cases
per 100,000. Since 1999, the incidence has been significantly lower,
down to 6.5 cases in 2002, but back up to 15.7 per 100,000 in 2003.
From 2004 to 2007, countrywide incidence rates ranged from 6.2 to
10.8. TBE risk areas are spread across the entire country, although
there are differences in virus load in ticks. Generally, the risk of
infection in Latvia is high, and only the southeast is less severely
affected. TBE cases have even been reported in and around the city
park of Riga, a very important recreation area for many inhabitants
of the capital of Latvia.

Food-borne outbreaks (caused by dairy products, mainly goat
milk) accounted for up to 5% of total annual cases (Lucenko et al.,
2004).

Ticks in Latvia have been reported to carry a higher TBEV load
than ticks in other risk countries (Bormane et al., 2004).

Lithuania

TBE is present in all districts of Lithuania (Han et al., 2002). From
2004 to 2008, a mean of 317 cases of TBE were reported annually.
In 2009, 617 cases were registered.

The highest annual incidences of TBE are recorded in the north-
ern and central parts of the country, i.e. mainly in the counties
Kaunas, Panevezys, and Siauliai. In these 3 regions, 17–32% of total
annual case numbers have been registered. In 2003, the incidence
rates in these areas remained unchanged, but increased substan-
tially in many other counties. Eight of 44 districts reported a 2–5
times higher incidence rate than the average incidence in Lithuania.
The highest incidence rate was recorded in Panevezys, with about
100 per 100,000 inhabitants (Asokliene, 2004).

Generally, the epidemiology of TBE in Lithuania in 2003 was
highly unusual. The incidence rate (763 cases, 22 per 100,000
inhabitants) was more than double the average incidence over
the previous 10 years (347 cases annually) and the highest ever
recorded since notification began at the end of the 1960s. Also, it
was the highest of all the Baltic countries in 2003. Four lethal cases
of TBE were notified in 2003. In 2004, a total of 425 hospitalized
cases were reported (Asokliene, 2004). 2004–2007, incidence rates
ranged from 6.9 to 13.5.

Even though mostly transmitted through a tick bite, 22 cases of
TBE in 2003 (4 clusters) were acquired by consumption of unpas-
teurized goat milk.

Moldova

Although there are no reliable data, it is assumed that TBE is
present (A. Movila, pers. comm.).

Norway

In Norway, TBE was first reported in 1998. All of the 44 cases
that occurred in Norway from 1998 to 2009 were acquired within
a limited area along the southern coast, mainly in the municipality
of Tromøy (Blystad et al., 2009). Most patients were infected in East
and West Agder counties.

A study carried out among regular patients attending a health

centre in Tromøy showed an anti-TBEV antibody seroprevalence of
2.4% (Skarpaas et al., 2002). In previous studies, IgG antibodies to
the TBEV had been found in 0.3–0.4% of persons from different parts
of Agder county, a region where TBE had not been seen previously
(Csango et al., 2004).

Since 1993, the number of reported cases at country level has
anged from 100 to 350 cases per year. In 2003, the number of
eported cases was 339 (0.89 per 100,000). In 2006, 316 cases were
eported. From 2004 to 2008, 237 cases were reported annually.
n 2009, the case number was 335 (P. Stefanoff, pers. comm.). The

ost important risk areas are located in the northeast of the country
tretching from Podtachia to Brest, in the border region in the east
etween Bialystok and Suwalki, in wide areas of the Masurian lake
istrict, including Olsztyn, and along the Baltic sea around Gdańsk,
dynia, and Elblag. High-risk areas also occur along the northwest-
rn border of Poland, stretching along the Vistula river and from
zczecin to Gorzow Wielkoposki. In southern Poland and in Silesia,
ighly endemic areas are found around Opole and Stalowa Wola.
here are also a few small areas in Poland where the virus appears
o be rare.

The north-east of the country around Bialystok is the main area
f endemicity (Grygorczuk et al., 2002). Eighty percent of cases
ccurred in the 2 north-eastern provinces adjacent to Lithuania
nd Belarus. Another important focus of the disease is in the south-
estern part of Poland, in districts adjacent to the Czech Republic.

omania

A risk for TBE is reported for Transylvania at the base of
he Carpathian Mountains and the Transylvanian Alps. There are
nconfirmed reports that clinical cases of TBE occur across the
ountry, some of alimentary origin (Molnár et al., 2008).

ussia

TBE is endemic from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. The high-
st morbidity rates have been registered in the Ural, Perm, and
verdlovsk regions (13.4 per 100,000 of population; Udmurt
epublic: 53.5 per 100,000; West Siberia, Tomsk region: 72.5 per
00,000; East Siberia, Krasnoyarsky Krai: 37 per 100,000) (Karan
t al., 2010).

After 1999, when 9955 cases were reported, the number of TBE
nfections decreased continuously, reaching an all-time low of 3098
eported cases in 2007. From 2004 to 2008, on an average 3642
ases were reported annually. In 2009, 3721 cases were diagnosed
Fig. 1c).

The fact that TBE incidence in Russia decreased continuously
rom 1999 to 2009 and that on the other hand in certain regions
f the country, it has been increasing steadily is not a contradic-
ion. Thus, 1997–2009, the incidence rate of TBE in the province
f Arkhangelsk increased from 1.4 per 100,000 to 11.2 (climate
hange?) (Karan et al., 2010).

The most dangerous foci of TBE have been found to be located
n the southern Okhotsk region with its dark coniferous forests
Leonova and Somov, 1989) and in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range
ear Vladivostok (Leonova and Borisovets, 1990). In the Primorye
egion, the far-eastern part of Russia along the coast of the ‘East
ea’ (Sea of Japan), 126 persons were hospitalized and diagnosed
ith TBE between from January to August 2004, 17 of them chil-
ren. A total of 8 fatalities were reported. From 1996 to 1999, the
umber of TBE patients in the Lake Baikal region ranged from 460
o 780 per year and showed a trend towards an increase. The rela-
ive index per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 2.6 to 18.1 (Titenko
t al., 2002).
The Sverdlovsk region has long been known to be a natural
idus of TBE. The majority of cases have been reported in Yekaterin-
urg. Other foci are in Nizhni Tagil, Kamensk-Uralsky, Verkhnyaya
yshma, Nizhnyaya Tura, Nevyansk, and Sukhoy Lo. The main TBEV
ector in the Asian and European parts of Russia is I. persulcatus.
Diseases 2 (2011) 2–15 11

Lethal TBE outcomes have been registered in Siberia (Irkutsk region
and Krasnoyarsk territory) and in the European parts of Russia
(Yaroslavl region) (Pogodina and Bochkova, 2004).

The northwestern parts of Russia are popular destinations for
tourists from Western Europe, the Baltic countries, and Scandi-
navia. The TBE incidence rate ranges between from 0.7 to 1 in and
around St. Petersburg, 0.1–0.4 in Murmansk, 8–11.6 in Karelia, and
0.9–1.3 in and around Kaliningrad.

In Russia, mixed infections after a tick bite are frequent. For
example, in the Kemerovo region, up to 48% of ticks were found
to carry 2 or more pathogens, with a wide variety of pathogen
combinations and mixed infections (e.g. Borrelia and TBE; Borre-
lia and human monocytic ehrlichiosis; Borrelia, TBE, and human
granulocytic anaplasmosis, etc.) (Poponnikova, 2010).

Serbia

A few TBE cases have been reported in the area near Belgrade,
including food-borne outbreaks near the Adriatic coast, but there
is no published information available on these cases.

Slovakia

The TBE risk areas have been known for a long time. From
1961 to 2004, 1786 clinical cases of TBE were registered, i.e. 40
cases annually (Lukan et al., 2010). More recently, from 1998 to
2007, the average annual number of reported cases was 65, rang-
ing from 46 to 92. In 2009, 71 cases were registered. Some of these
were caused by consumption of homemade raw goat or sheep
milk.

The known risk areas, where the highest numbers of clinical
TBE cases have occurred, are located in the southwest of Slovakia
and along its southern border. Most risk areas are situated in the
Carpathian Mountains, in the southern subcarpathian regions, and
in the Pannonian lowlands. New small foci, e.g. around Košice, have
been identified in areas of eastern Slovakia traditionally thought to
be free of TBEV (Labuda et al., 2002).

Slovenia

Although endemic foci of TBE are spread across the country, they
are mainly concentrated in the central part and in the Alps, partic-
ularly around the cities of Kranje and Trzic, and in the south around
Ribnica and Kocevje. The risk of infection is particularly high in and
around Ljubljana and Celje (Jereb et al., 2006).

From 2001 to 2005, the 5-year average in the number of TBE
cases was 261. The highest case number was reported in 1994, with
a total of 762 cases. In 2006, 373 cases were registered. From 2004
to 2008, an annual mean of 264 cases was reported. In 2009, 307
cases were registered. In recent years, incidence rates were 12–14
per 100,000 inhabitants.

Sweden

TBE epidemiology in Sweden is characterized by continuous
increases in incidence, an expansion of classical risk areas, and the
detection of new foci. From 1990 to 1999, an annual mean of 68
cases had been registered, from 2000 to 2009, the annual mean
number was 155 cases. In the 5-year period 2004–2008, the annual
average was 173 cases. The highest number of cases in recorded his-
tory was registered in 2008, with a total of 224 cases (M. Haglund,

pers. comm.). In 2009, 211 cases of TBE were reported.

From 2004 to 2007, incidence rates were 1.5–2.4 per 100,000.
In 2003, most infections were acquired in the counties of Stock-
holm (56%), in the adjacent coastal regions in Södermanland (15%),
and in Uppsala (6%). Cases have occurred on the islands of Gotland

nd Öland as well as on other islands in the area. In the county
f Västra Götaland south of Lake Vänern, 5–10 cases are notified
nnually, with a trend towards an increase in case numbers. In the
est of Sweden, sporadic cases occur every year. A few scattered
ases have been reported from Dalsland and Bohuslän in the west
nd Skåne and Blekinge in the south of Sweden (Burenhult et al.,
002). More recently, during 2007–2009 there were three human
BE cases recorded in the province of Dalama, one case in 2008 in
he province of Västerbotten (about 600 km north of Stockholm),
nd another case in 2009 in the province of Ångermanland (T.G.T.
aenson, pers. commun.).

witzerland and Liechtenstein

In the 5-year period 2004–2008, a mean of 169 cases was
eported annually. In 2006, 259 cases were reported, the highest in
ecorded history in Switzerland. In 2009, 118 cases were registered
T. Krech, pers. commun; Bundesamt für Gesundheit, 2007). There
re 2 high-risk regions, the larger one covering the midland, with
he exception of the far-western part, and the smaller one located in
he upper Rhine valley, including the principality of Liechtenstein. A
ocus of ticks infected with the TBEV is located on a much-used for-
st path near Vaduz, the capital of the principality (Aberham et al.,
992). The canton Zürich has become the most dangerous region for
BE in Switzerland (Krech, 2002), followed by Thurgau, St. Gallen,
argau, and Bern. The TBE risk areas in the northeast of Switzerland
ave remained stable, but risk areas in western Switzerland have
eveloped, i.e. Neuchâtel.

kraine

The TBE foci are located throughout the entire mountain forest
one of Crimea and in Volinskij. They correspond to the habitat
f I. ricinus, the main vector of TBEV (Evstaf’ev, 2001). Natural foci
lso exist in the northwest of the country. From 1980 to 1990, about
00 patients with TBE were recorded in Crimea, where coinfections
ith TBEV and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus have been

ound (Markeshin et al., 1992). More recent data are unavailable,
ith unofficial reports indicating about 50 cases annually.

sia

In recent years, reliable data from Asia have become available,
howing that TBEV is also endemic in a number of non-European
ountries, such as Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Japan,
nd South Korea. However, because notification of TBE cases has
ot been mandatory, diagnostic tools have been underused, and
wareness of the disease is low, the epidemiological picture is still
atchy.

hina

Even though endemic, TBE is not a notifiable disease in China,
hich is why information on endemic areas is incomplete. TBE

isk areas have been identified in northeastern, northwestern, and
outhwestern China, with the main endemic areas located in the
rovince of Heilongjiang in the northeast of the People’s Republic.
rom 1980 to 1998, 2202 cases of TBE were registered. From 1995

o 1998, 420 infections were diagnosed and the seasons with the
ighest numbers of reported cases were May (44 cases) and June
210 cases). The main vector of the disease is I. persulcatus (Süss,
003; Lu et al., 2008). In rarer cases, Dermacentor silvarum has been

dentified as a carrier of TBEV (Lu et al., 2008).
iseases 2 (2011) 2–15

Japan

In 1993, a case of TBE was reported from the southern
part of Hokkaido. Since 1995, TBEV has been isolated from the
blood samples of sentinel dogs, tick pools, and rodent spleens. A
seroepidemiological survey performed among humans and ani-
mals showed that TBEV may be endemic in Japan, at least on the
Island of Hokkaido (Bröker, 2002). The main vector on Hokkaido
was identified as I. ovatus, and genomic sequence and phylo-
genetic analyses of a virus isolate showed a close relationship
with TBEV-Fe (Takashima et al., 1997; Takashima, 1998). I. per-
sulcatus is also a common species in this area (Takashima et al.,
1997).

Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan has long been suspected to be endemic for TBE.
Endemic areas are focused in the eastern parts of the country and
in the region of Almaty. In eastern Kazakhstan, 34 cases of TBE
were reported in 2004, 28 in 2005, and 18 in 2006. In the sur-
roundings of Almaty, the corresponding figures were 10, 9, and 6.
In the city of Almaty, 6 cases were reported in 2004, 12 in 2005,
and 8 in 2006. Overall, 245 clinical cases of TBE were reported in
Kazakhstan from 2004 to 2009 (Deryabin, 2010). People bitten by
a tick in Kazakhstan get treated by passive immunization against
TBEV (Deryabin, 2010).

In the province of Aksu, virus antigen was detected by ELISA in
cow milk. Risk areas in Kazakhstan appear to spread far beyond
currently known endemic areas, with virus antigen detected in
ticks using ELISA (Zhambyl region, Kyzyl-Orda region, eastern
Kazakhstan). Overall, therefore, the number of unreported cases
is believed to be much higher.

Kyrgyzstan

As yet unpublished data on the presence of TBEV in small mam-
mals (Alticola argentatus, Apodemus spp., and Microtus spp.) suggest
that the virus is endemic in Kyrgyzstan. Preliminary results suggest
that in Kyrgyzstan TBEV-Sib is predominant. Clinical cases have not
been reported yet (Atkinson, 2010).

Mongolia

In 2004, some endemic areas were described close to the Rus-
sian border in the north of the country (provinces of Selenga and
Bulgan) and around the capital city Ulan-Bataar based on indirect,
serological evidence (Walder et al., 2006). In 2008, a first patient
died with diagnosed meningoencephalitis, the virus was isolated
from the brain and characterized. The virus was genetically closest
related to the TBEV-Fe subtype (Khasnatinov et al., 2010).

South Korea

In South Korea, TBEV has recently been isolated from ticks
(Haemaphysalis longicornis, I. nipponensis) and mice (Apodemus
agrarius) and, surprisingly, was found to be TBEV-Eu. The virus
has been isolated in the areas of Dongducheon, Geyonggi-
do; Jeongseon, Gangwon-do; Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do; and
Gurye, Jeonrabuk-do. Cases of TBE have not been registered, but
there have been several CNS diseases of unknown origin which are
currently being followed up (Kim et al., 2008).

Abstract

A tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient has not been reported for many years in Japan

although a serological survey of domestic animal sera suggested the presence of TBE foci in
Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. In October 1993 in Hokkaido, a severe
encephalitis case in a farm wife was diagnosed as tick-borne encephalitis. Serological

examination of paired sera showed a rise of neutralization (NT) antibody titer to Russian
spring summer encephalitis virus. A sero-epizootiological survey of dogs showed that the
TBE-related virus was prevalent in the area. Three virus isolates were obtained from the

blood of sentinel dogs and the antigenic analysis grouped the isolates into TBE-related
viruses. Sequence analysis of envelope protein gene identi®ed one of the isolates as the same
subtype as Russian spring summer encephalitis (Far-Eastern TBE) virus. The results
provide the evidence that TBE is endemic in a certain area of Japan. # 1998 Published by

1. Introduction

The family Flaviviridae includes nearly 70 antigenically distinct viruses, many of

which cause severe illness in humans and animals [1, 2]. Ecologically, they are

divided into mosquito- and tick-borne viruses. The latter comprise a complex of

viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), louping ill, Omsk hemorrhagic

fever, Kyasanur Forest fever, and Powassan encephalitis virus [3, 4] (Table 1).

They were often called TBE complex because of antigenic similarities. Like

mosquito-borne yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus,

TBE virus represents one of the major human pathogenic ¯aviviruses causing

thousands of cases of severe neurological disease per year. TBE is thus a

signi®cant public health problem in endemic areas of Asia and Europe. Two

subtypes of TBE virus, Western (central European) subtype and Far-Eastern

subtype (prototype; Russian spring summer encephalitis virus strain Sofjin) are

prevalent on the Eurasian Continent [5, 6]. The latter subtype is known to be

highly pathogenic to humans with a mortality rate of about 30% or more [7]. This

article gives brief information of TBE in general and the epidemiological survey

results of TBE found recently in Japan.

2. Transmission cycle of TBE virus in nature

TBE virus circulates in nature as represented in Fig. 1. The virus is passed from
adult ticks to eggs by transovarial transmission and is further transmitted trans-
stadially from one stage to the next. Persistence of the virus in nature requires a
large population of both small mammals and ticks. The virus foci are very stable
for years unless the ecological conditions are changed either by man or nature.
The virus can be transmitted to man or other hosts by larvae, nymphs or adult
ticks. Larvae and nymphs acquired the virus from infected small mammals and
birds. Vector tick species of TBE virus Western subtype is known as Ixodes ricinus
and that of Far-Eastern subtype as Ixodes persulcatus. But other species of ticks
can serve as the vector of TBE virus. Besides the main transmission route by the
tick bite, humans may acquire the infection by drinking raw milk from goats,
sheep and cows.

3. History and present epidemiology

Illness of the TBE Far Eastern subtype was ®rst reported in Russia in 1937
during an epidemic in southern Far East, and the causing virus was isolated from
the brain of an encephalitis patient [8]. Similar encephalitis was described in
Czechoslovakia in 1948 during an epidemic in Central Bohemia, and TBE virus
Western subtype was isolated [9]. TBE cases are reported in Europe and north
Asia. In the 1990 s, total annual TBE numbers were 6000±10 000 cases among
which 5000±7000 cases have been reported from Russia [10]. The largest number
of cases in recent years was observed in the Ural and in western Siberia where
incidence rates reached 2.7±6.5 and 3.0±4.0 per 100 000, respectively [11, 12]. In

Fig. 1. Transmission cycle of TBE virus.

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±90 83



the 1950s and 1960s, cases occurred mainly in rural areas, but in the 1970s, 1980s
and 1990s, more than 70% of reported cases were in urban dwellers [12].

4. Background information of TBE in Hokkaido, Japan

Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, is located close to the Maritime
Province of Siberia in Far Eastern Russia, in which TBE is prevalent. Both areas,
once connected by land, share the same biogeographical and ecological
environments. Ixodes persulcatus, vector tick of TBE virus in Siberia, is a
predominant species in Hokkaido; and some rodent species, reservoir hosts of the
virus, are also common in both areas. From the viewpoint of an ecological setting
for the virus, it is not surprising that TBE virus of Far Eastern subtype is endemic
to Hokkaido. The presence of scattered TBE foci had been suspected in the area
from previous seroepidemiological surveys in 1978 using cattle sera [13].

In 1993, a case of human viral encephalitis was diagnosed as TBE in Kamiiso,
the southern part of Hokkaido. The following are the results of case ®ndings of
TBE, seroepidemiological survey, virus isolation and the sequence analysis of the
virus envelope (E) protein gene, in order to demonstrate that TBE is endemic in
Japan.

5. Clinical ®ndings

On 27 October 1993, a dairy farmer's wife in the town of Kamiiso suddenly
suered a febrile illness with a temperature of 398C. She was hospitalized on the
third day after the onset of illness. Double vision was reported on the second day,
convulsions on the ®fth day. She was under pulmotor from day ®ve to twenty.
Remaining motor paralysis of the arms and neck was present three years later.
Cerebrospinal ¯uid examination at acute and convalescent phases clearly showed
that she suered from encephalitis or encephalomyelitis of viral origin [14, 15].
The patient's dairy farm was located in the town of Kamiiso in the Oshima

district, Hokkaido (Fig. 2). Four farms were distributed there within a 1.0 km
radius. The area was deforested 50 years ago. The sera and cerebrospinal ¯uid
were examined by ELISA for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (Table 2). ELISA
IgG titer for JE virus increased signi®cantly from acute phase to convalescent
phase. However, ELISA IgM titer essential in JE diagnosis was negative.
Therefore, another ¯avivirus infection was suspected as the cause of the
encephalitis in this case and a more speci®c neutralization test (NT) was
performed including Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus strain JaGAr-01, Negishi
virus isolated in 1948 in Japan [16], Apoi virus isolated from rodents in Hokkaido
in 1954 [17], and Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus strain Sofjin.
NT antibody titers increased signi®cantly to RSSE virus at acute and convalescent

I. Takashima / Comp. Immun., Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 21 (1998) 81±9084



phases among the ¯aviviruses tested. The results indicated that the patient was
infected with a TBE-related virus [14, 18].

6. Epidemiological study in 1994

In 1994, a serological examination of animal sera was conducted for cattle and
dogs kept on farms of a case study area to con®rm that the virus is prevalent
endemically in the aected area, and to examine cow milk as a possible source of
infection. Positive antibody was not detected in 54 cattle sera collected from the
farm of the patient and an adjacent farm, suggesting no connection of cow milk
with infection source. Dogs in the area were selected as indicator animals based

on the observation that dogs were infested with ticks. Sera of nine dogs from four
farms in the aected area were collected in July 1994, and NT titers were
determined to JE virus, RSSE and Langat viruses of tick-borne encephalitis
complex (Table 3). Eight out of nine dogs showed signi®cantly higher titer to
RSSE virus than JE virus. Although titer to Langat virus was lower than RSSE
virus, it was higher than JE virus. The results showed that the TBE-related virus
was prevalent in the area. Comparison of NT titers to three ¯aviviruses
demonstrated that Langat virus could substitute as assay virus instead of the
highly pathogenic RSSE virus.

A serological survey was extended to the residents of the aected area. Five
human sera, including four family members of the patient and a neighbouring
farmer, were tested. Negative titer (<1:20) was obtained from four family
members to Langat virus. However, the neighbouring farmer's serum had speci®c
NT titer to RSSE virus (1:100). He had suered severe encephalitis clinically
suspected as JE 35 years ago and was hospitalized for two months. He claimed to
have suered motor paralysis of the neck for one year.

7. Epidemiological survey using sentinel dogs in 1995

In 1995, 10 sentinel dogs were kept in the area in a free-living environment and
the serum samples were collected once a week from April to July. NT titers of the
dog sera to Langat virus were determined and virus isolation was carried out
(Table 4). On 22 April all 10 dogs had a negative antibody to Langat virus. Two
animals converted to positive on 4 May, three on 13 May and ®ve on 27 May.
The results clearly showed that the virus was prevalent in the area in 1995. The

blood was inoculated into suckling mice via an intracerebral route. Three viral
strains were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs Nos. 5, 8 and 9 which were
obtained seven days prior to the sero-converted day. The virus strains from dogs
Nos 5, 8 and 9 were designated as Oshima-3-6, -5-10 and -5-11, respectively.
Antigenicities of the virus isolates were examined by IFA test using monoclonal
antibodies supplied by Dr F. X. Heinz at the University of Vienna, Austria [19±
21]. Three of the isolates showed high titers to TBE-complex-speci®c 2E7 and
TBE-type-speci®c 7G7 monoclonal antibodies [15]. The viral strains isolated were
identi®ed as TBE-related virus.

8. Characterization of the virus isolates

Sequence and phylogenic analysis of one of the isolates, Oshima-5-10 strain,
was performed targeting the E-protein gene. The whole E-protein gene was
ampli®ed by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. The sequence of Oshima virus was
compared with those of TBE complex viruses (Table 5). The nucleotide identities
of Oshima virus with RSSE (Far Eastern subtype) and Western tick-borne
encephalitis (WTBE) were 95.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Oshima virus showed
extremely high identities of the amino acid sequences with RSSE (99.0%) and
WTBE (95.8%). Oshima virus was grouped in RSSE subtype.

9. Discussion

TBE in Hokkaido, Japan. The encephalitis case found in Hokkaido, Japan, in

1993 was diagnosed as TBE since NT titers of the patient sera were higher to
TBE(RSSE) virus than other ¯aviviruses. NT titers of paired sera also increased
from acute to convalescent phases to TBE virus and very low to JE virus.

The patient was suspected of having acquired the virus infection in the area,
and the virus may have been indigenous to the area for many years. The above
assumption was made for the following reasons. (1) The patient had no history of
travel abroad. (2) In the years 1994 and 1995, virus activity was clearly
demonstrated in the dog population by serological examination and virus
isolation. (3) The neighbouring farmer with speci®c TBE antibody was probably
infected with TBE virus 35 years ago when he suered from encephalitis. (4) In
1978 we had performed a serological survey of TBE virus in Hokkaido using
cattle sera and found positive areas at several foci [13]. (5) TBE virus has been
shown to be endemic in certain foci for many years due to its ecological nature.
The virus can be maintained in the tick trans-stadially and transovarially, and the
reservoir animals are indigenous rodents whose migration is very limited.
However, the above assumption that the virus may have been indigenous for
many years has to be veri®ed further.
Dogs and/or sentinel animals were found to be superior indicators for TBE

virus survey. A high positive antibody rate was detected in dog sera from the
aected area. The time of the virus activity could be monitored by consecutive
testing of the sera. The viruses were isolated from the blood of sentinel dogs. The
viremic period of dogs was reported to be seven days before the neutralizing
antibodies were ®rst detected in the serum from the infected animals [22]. No
clinical signs developed in the experimentally infected dogs or in our sentinel
dogs [22].

The isolated virus strains were identi®ed as TBE-related virus from the results
of the reaction pattern with monoclonal antibodies, and one of the isolates was
shown to be RSSE (Far-Eastern) subtype virus from sequence analysis of the E-
protein gene. Monoclonal antibody 6E2 reacts widely to ¯aviviruses, 2E7 to the

viruses of TBE complex and 7G7 only to TBE viruses of Western subtype and
Far Eastern subtype [19±21]. The E-protein gene of Oshima 5-10 showed the
closest relationship with RSSE virus.

TBE virus may be endemic to areas other than the case study area in Japan.
The dog sera from another district in Hokkaido showed a positive antibody to
TBE virus [23]. I. persulcatus ticks were reported as a principal vector species of
RSSE virus in the far eastern part of Russia. However, our tick collection study
shows that I. ovatus is the predominant species in the case study area and may be
the vector tick in this area [23]. Since I. ovatus tick is a common species all over
Japan, epidemiological surveys should also extend to Honshyu, the main island of
Japan, to reveal the extent of TBE endemicity.

These ®ndings should prompt physicians to consider TBE as one of the causes
of viral encephalitis and to dierentiate it from JE in an area such as Japan. JE is
prevalent in many Asian countries but TBE may not have been reported because
of similar clinical symptoms and a high degree of cross-reactivity in serological
tests. Prompt preventive measures must be established in Japan by further studies
to specify endemic areas and to develop a vaccine strategy against the prevalent
TBE-related virus.

RESUMO

Em amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco (Acre), foi pesquisada a freqüência de portadores de anticorpos contra os
arbovírus, mais prevalentes na região amazônica, e o vírus vacinal da febre amarela, antes e após a imunização com a vacina
17D. Das 390 pessoas incluídas na primeira fase do estudo (agosto de 1999), somente 190 compareceram em janeiro de 2000,
três meses após a aplicação da vacina 17D (outubro de 1999). Nas amostras da primeira fase, as freqüências de soropositivos
(IH) para os vírus estudados foram: 17D (27,2%); Dengue-1 (0,3%); Dengue-2 (4,1%); Dengue-3 (0%); Dengue-4 (0%),
entre outros 8 vírus. Nas amostras séricas de janeiro (2000), a soroconversão para o 17D foi de 89,7% (130/145) e 3,2% (6/
190) passaram a ter anticorpos contra o sorotipo 3 (DEN-3). Em conclusão, por conta da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal e
de soroconversão há redução significativa do risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela na cidade de Rio Branco, apesar
de não ser desprezível a possibilidade de uma nova epidemia de dengue, pelo DEN-3, a semelhança da registrada em 2000 e
2001 pelos sorotipos 1 e 2.

ABSTRACT

During a yellow fever vaccination campaign among residents of Rio Branco (Acre State), the frequency of HI antibodies to the most
prevalent arboviruses in the Amazon region and to yellow fever virus was determined before and three months after immunization
with YF 17D vaccine. From 390 inhabitants included in the first phase of serologic survey (August 1999), only 190 provided a
second serum sample, after the use of 17D vaccine (January 2000). Among first phase samples, the frequency of HI antibodies was:
17D (27.2%); Ilheus (5.9%); Mayaro (5.4%); Caraparu (4.9%); Dengue-2 (4.1%); Oropouche (2.3%); and Dengue-1 (0.3%). In
the second study phase, the serologic conversion to YF reached 89.7% among previously negative persons. Serologic conversions were
also observed to Ilheus (6.2%); Dengue-3 (3.2%); Mayaro (1.1%); and Oropouche (1.1%) viruses. In conclusion, considering the
high YF antibody rate after vaccination, the risk of urban yellow fever seems insignificant, although the lower prevalence of HI
antibodies to dengue viruses, is of concern and inhabitants are under high risk of dengue outbreaks, especially to DEN-3 recently
introduced in Brazil, as was observed in 2000 and 2001 with DEN-1 and DEN-2.

Na região amazônica brasileira, foram realizados amplos
levantamentos sobre a soroepidemiologia dos arbovírus17 18, onde também
foi isolada e ou caracterizada grande parte dos mesmos17 18 19 24.

Não obstante, na população do Estado do Acre há uma lacuna
no conhecimento sobre a soroepidemiologia dos arbovírus e o
impacto na Saúde Pública17, apesar das condições epidemiológicas
favoráveis à circulação de arbovírus em decorrência das extensas
áreas de florestas tropicais nativas e da grande biodiversidade.
Nessa região do Brasil, os estudos arbovirológicos ficaram restritos
às investigações iniciais sobre a Febre Negra de Lábrea6 e de
tentativas de isolamento viral em animais (aves, répteis e mosquitos)
coletados no município de Sena Madureira7 8. Mais recentemente,
em janeiro de 2001, ocorreu a incidência máxima da epidemia de
dengue pelos sorotipos 1 e 2 (DEN-1 e DEN-2) nas cidades do Vale
do Rio Acre, especialmente na capital do Estado (Rio Branco). Isto,
após o registro crescente de casos de dengue ao longo do segundo
semestre de 20004. Anteriormente, em novembro de 1999, houve
registro dos primeiros casos de dengue na cidade boliviana de
Cobija, vizinha às cidades acreanas de Brasiléia e Epitaciolância4.

Essa situação do Estado do Acre motivou o presente estudo
soroepidemiológico sobre os principais arbovírus descritos na região
amazônica, em uma amostra da população da cidade de Rio Branco,
antes (agosto de 1999) da vacinação em massa contra o vírus
vacinal da febre amarela (17D) em 10 de outubro de 1999 e da
ocorrência da epidemia de dengue em 2000/2001.

MATERIAL E MÉTODOS

No primeiro dia da Campanha Estadual de Vacinação contra o
vírus da hepatite B (VHB), em 14 de agosto de 1999, foram
selecionadas 394 pessoas residentes na área urbana da cidade de
Rio Branco (Acre), com 2 ou mais anos de idade, entre aquelas que
compareceram a um dos 212 Postos de Vacinação (temporários) da
cidade. Em cada Posto de Vacinação foi selecionada de uma a duas
pessoas para coleta da amostra sangüínea e levantamento de
informações demográficas e sobre a vacinação prévia contra o
vírus vacinal (17D) da febre amarela, após conhecer os objetivos
da pesquisa e assinar o termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido.
A primeira pessoa selecionada era aquela da fila para vacinação
que estava sendo atendida (ainda na fase de preenchimento dos
dados pessoais), quando da chegada da equipe da pesquisa ao Posto
de Vacinação. Nos Postos de Vacinação com mais de 30 pessoas na
fila, foi selecionada a outra pessoa subseqüente na fila, desde que
não-membro da família da primeira. Quando houve recusa de
alguma pessoa (no total de dois casos), foi incluída a pessoa seguinte
na fila para vacinação2.

Em seguida ao preenchimento do questionário, foram coletados
de 8 a 10ml de sangue venoso sem anticoagulante. Em seguida, as
amostras sangüíneas foram centrifugadas e estocadas (-20o C) no
LACEN- AC, onde foram conservadas até o envio para o Laboratório
de Arbovírus do Instituto Evandro Chagas (Belém, PA), para a
pesquisa de anticorpos inibidores da hemaglutinação (IH), pela
técnica de Clarke & Casals modificada por Shope21, dos seguintes
arbovírus: Alphavirus da família Togaviridae (vírus Mayaro e

Mucambo); Flavivirus da família Flaviviridae (vírus Ilhéus, Rocio,
Dengue-1, Dengue-2, Dengue-3, Dengue-4, Saint Louis e o vírus
vacinal da febre amarela, 17D); e Bunyavirus da família
Bunyaviridae (vírus Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu). Esses 13 vírus,
nem todos são estritamente arbovírus10, foram estudados usando
soros-controles, positivos e negativos, padronizados pelo IEC
(Belém, PA) e considerando soropositivo a amostra com título
recíproco ≥20. Os soropositivos para os sorotipos do vírus da dengue
foram considerados como resposta primária ou secundária, de
acordo com os critérios da Organização Panamericana de Saúde14:
( i)  primária,  quando o t í tulo recíproco era <1.280 e,
simultaneamente, havia ausência de resposta ou títulos 4 vezes
menores  para os demais sorotipos do dengue ou outros flavivírus;
e (ii) secundária, títulos recíprocos iguais ou maiores a 1.280 para
todos os sorotipos do dengue e/ou outros flavivírus.

A segunda etapa do estudo foi realizada três (3) meses depois,
entre os dias 19 a 21 de janeiro de 2000, após a aplicação da vacina
contra o 17D (BIOMANGUINHOS®, Rio de Janeiro) no dia 10 de
outubro de 2000 em toda a população do Estado do Acre. Oito dias
antes do início da segunda etapa, todos os participantes do estudo
(n=394) foram convidados, por carta, pela Secretaria de Estado de
Sáude e Saneamento do Estado (SESSACRE) para nova coleta de
sangue, sendo esclarecido qual o objetivo do estudo (pesquisa
sorológica do marcador anti-HBs do VHB e anti-17D), e o motivo,
ambos descritos em linguagem acessível ao grande público. Na
mesma carta-convite, foi solicitado que a pessoa ou responsável
legal levasse a caderneta de vacinação, entregue em agosto de
1999, ou atualizada em outubro e dezembro de 1999 por ocasião,
respectivamente, da primeira, segunda (+ a vacina 17D) e terceira
doses da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Nessa segunda etapa,
após a coleta de nova amostra sangüínea, foram seguidos os mesmos
procedimentos anteriores, e preenchido o segundo módulo do
questionário (dados pessoais, história de vacinação nos meses
anteriores e exame da caderneta de vacinação). Por ocasião da
segunda etapa do estudo, ainda não eram conhecidos os resultados
dos exames sorológicos da primeira amostra sérica.

As análises estatísticas foram realizadas com auxílio do
“software” Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Na
análise dos resultados, as pessoas naturais do Estado do Acre e
nascidas em municípios da região oriental foram incluídas como
sendo da região do Vale do Rio Acre, enquanto que aquelas nascidas
em municípios da região central e ocidental do Estado como do
Vale do Rio Juruá. Para as variáveis contínuas foram determinadas
a média, o desvio-padrão e a mediana, enquanto para as variáveis
categóricas as medidas de freqüência. As associações foram
consideradas estatisticamente significantes se a probabilidade do
erro α foi ≤0,05 (p≤5%).

RESULTADOS

Das 394 pessoas incluídas no estudo, quatro foram excluídas
porque a primeira amostra sérica foi perdida durante o
processamento laboratorial ou por ocasião do transporte até Belém
(PA). Na segunda etapa do estudo, somente atenderam ao convite
190 (48,7%) pessoas. Os resultados da pesquisa sorológica na

primeira (de agosto de 1999) e na segunda (de janeiro de 2000) amostras
séricas estão descritos na Tabela 1. Todas as respostas sorológicas foram
do tipo primária, exceto em 21,7% (23/106) dos 17D-positivos (agosto
de 1999) e que foi secundária para dois ou mais flavivírus.

Na Tabela 2, foi comparado o resultado sorológico dentre as
variáveis demográficas pesquisadas (sexo e idade), tanto nas pessoas
com anticorpos contra o 17D (em agosto de 1999) como para o
conjunto daqueles com anticorpos para os arbovírus pesquisados
em agosto de 1999. Nesse último grupo, a pessoa amostrada somente
foi considerada uma vez e excluindo aquelas com anticorpos para
o vírus 17D. Por isto, dos 203 soropositivos (106 para o 17D e 97
para os outros arbovírus), somente foram incluídas 80 pessoas, ou
seja, 17 (80 + 17=97) pessoas tinham anticorpos para 2 (n=13) ou
3 (n=4) dos arbovírus investigados. Desse modo, foi possível mostrar
na Tabela 2 que antes da intervenção (vacina contra a febre
amarela), havia a predominância significante (p<0,05) de pessoas
soropositivas para o 17D do sexo masculino (31,9% vs 22,8%), mas
que após a vacinação as freqüências (respectivamente, 93,1% vs
91,3%) de soroconvertidos foram semelhantes (p>0,62). Em
relação ao estudo sorológico da amostra de agosto de 1999, as
pessoas do sexo masculino foram também mais freqüentemente
(p<0,005) soropositivas (26,6% vs 14,8%) para o conjunto de
arbovírus. Quanto à idade, os soropositivos para o 17D em agosto de
1999 (p<0,001) e para o conjunto dos arbovírus (p<0,001)
apresentaram médias de idade significativamente maiores (Tabela
2). No entanto, entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos (n=145),
na amostra de agosto de 1999 e também avaliados em janeiro de
2000, foram semelhantes (p>0,46) as médias das idades dos
soropositivos e negativos (Tabela 2).

Não foi estudado o tempo de residência no Estado do Acre, mas
a distribuição do resultado sorológico para o conjunto dos arbovírus
pesquisados teve freqüências de soropositivos semelhantes (p>0,18)
quanto à naturalidade: Estado do Acre (19,6% ou 62/316); outros
Estados amazônicos (16,7% ou 6/36) ou de outras unidades federadas
(31,6% ou 12/38). Também, entre os naturais do Estado do Acre
(n=316), não foram observadas diferenças significantes (p>0,20)
nas freqüências de soropositivos (conjunto de arbovírus) entre
aqueles naturais de municípios do Vale do Acre (18,3% ou 47/257)
versus os do Vale do Juruá (25,4% ou 15/59). Entre os naturais do
Vale do Acre (n=257), grande parte (80,9%; n=208) era da cidade
de Rio Branco.

O valor preditivo-positivo da história de vacinação prévia, em
relação à pesquisa de anticorpos anti-17D nas amostras de agosto
de 1999, foi baixo - de 30,6% (64/209) -, ao contrário do valor

Da população estudada em agosto de 1999, quase um terço
(27,2%) era portadora de anticorpos contra o vírus vacinal da febre
amarela (17D). Entre os soronegativos (n=284) compareceram na
segunda etapa 145 (51,1%) pessoas e do grupo de soropositivos
(n=106) 45 (42,4%) atenderam o convite, sendo essas diferenças
sem significado estatístico (χ²=2,78; p>0,09). Na segunda etapa,
a soroconversão (três meses após a vacina 17D) foi de 89,7% (130/
145) e os 45 soropositivos (da amostra de agosto de 1999), pesquisados
em janeiro de 2000, tiveram o mesmo resultado sorológico anterior.

A soroprevalência dos portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus
pesquisados  (Tabela 1), foi inferior a 6%, inclusive para o Oropouche
(2,3%), Mayaro (5,4%) e Ilhéus (5,9%), entre outros. Chama a atenção, as
freqüências de soropositivos, nas amostras de agosto de 1999, contra os
sorotipos do vírus da dengue, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 e DEN-4,
respectivamente: 0,3%; 4,1%; 0% e 0%. No entanto, cinco meses após
(janeiro de 2000) da primeira amostra sangüínea (em agosto de 1999),
todos os soronegativos (DEN-1, DEN-2 e DEN-3) pesquisados assim
permaneceram, mas 3,2% (6/190) daqueles soronegativos para o DEN-3
ficaram soropositivos (Tabela 1). Em tempo semelhante, também foi
observada soroconversão para os arbovírus Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%)
e Oropouche (1,1%).

preditivo-negativo de 77,4% (89/115), mas as diferenças observadas
(Tabela 3) não alcançaram significância estatística (p>0,24).
Quando foi levantada a história de vacinação contra o vírus vacinal
17D, em outubro de 1999, e comparada à pesquisa de anticorpos
anti-17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000, o valor preditivo-
positivo foi elevado de 92,1% (152/165), sendo baixo (8,3%) o valor
preditivo-negativo (Tabela 3).

A Tabela 3 também mostra que foi muito baixa (0,3%) a
freqüência de pessoas que portavam a caderneta de vacinação,
quando da primeira dose da Campanha Estadual (agosto de 1999) e
que em janeiro de 2000, cinco meses após, somente 39,5%
apresentaram a caderneta de vacinação, mas sendo semelhante
(p>0,60) a proporção de soropositivos entre os portadores da
caderneta (93,3%) e os não-portadores (91,3%).

Nenhuma pessoa, com história de vacinação (17D) em outubro
de 1999 e pesquisada em janeiro de 2000, referiu qualquer agravo
à saúde nos três meses subseqüentes ou a algum evento adverso,
relacionado à vacina, de intensidade moderada ou grave.

DISCUSSÃO

Esse é o primeiro estudo realizado no Estado do Acre, sobre a
prevalência de portadores de anticorpos contra os arbovírus mais
prevalentes na região Norte do Brasil17 18  19. Talvez, pela procedência
e naturalidade predominantemente urbana da amostra populacional,
a freqüência de soropositivos (<6%) para grande parte dos vírus
estudados (Mayaro, Mucambo, Ilhéus, Rocio, Saint Louis,
Oropouche, Caraparu e Catu) foi inferior à esperada, considerando
os resultados de outros estudos sorológicos realizados na região
amazônica17. É preciso considerar que não devem ser raros os
prováveis contatos (e.g. lazer e ocupacionais) com áreas de
florestas nativas, inclusive entre aqueles nascidos na cidade de Rio

Branco, o que muito mais provavelmente ocorre entre os nascidos
em cidades de menor porte do Estado do Acre. No entanto, o encontro
de mais soropositivos (31,6% vs <20%) entre os não-naturais de
Estados amazônicos, apesar da ausência de significado estatístico,
pode evidenciar a maior exposição desses migrantes em atividades
extrativistas ou vinculadas à agricultura ou à agroindústria.

Na população estudada, a soroconversão observada para os vírus
Ilhéus (6,2%), Mayaro (1,1%) e Oropouche (1,1%), entre a primeira
e a segunda amostra sérica, evidencia a provável circulação desses
vírus ou outro(s) antigenicamente relacionado(s). Considerando as
características da população avaliada, especialmente o efeito da
amplitude da faixa etária e do maior contingente de naturais da
cidade de Rio Branco, essas incidências, no período de 5 meses,
podem ser classificadas como de valores entre médios a elevados. No
entanto, na região Norte do Brasil, não há conhecimento sobre estudo
avaliando a incidência de alguma infecção por arbovírus.

Coerentemente, as pessoas com anticorpos para o conjunto dos
arbovírus estudados foram mais freqüentemente do sexo masculino
e de maior idade, evidenciando provavelmente a maior exposição
dessas pessoas às áreas de maior circulação dos vírus estudados,
onde são próprias para as atividades ocupacionais extrativistas,
agrícolas ou de lazer (e. g. caça e pesca). Em publicações anteriores,
a freqüência de soropositivos para anticorpos contra esses arbovírus
aumentou, proporcionalmente, ao aumento da idade9  22  23, o que
pode ter associação com o tempo de maior exposição nas atividades
de maior risco para adquirir a infecção. No entanto, quanto ao
sexo, as observações são variáveis conforme a população estudada22

e, talvez isto se explique, por questões de gênero ou, mais
especificamente, porque as mulheres têm menos rotineiramente
atividades vinculadas às áreas de floresta tropical.

dengue foram importados. No entanto, em novembro de 1999, houve
os primeiros registros de dengue na cidade boliviana de Cobija4.
Portanto, as soroprevalências dos DEN-1 (0,3%) e DEN-2 (4,1%)
observadas nas amostras de agosto de 1999, provavelmente,
espelham aquele momento epidemiológico. Já no ano 2000, na
cidade de Rio Branco foram notificados 2.178 casos de dengue,
especialmente nos meses de novembro (n=326) e dezembro
(n=525), e com a confirmação de 1.283 casos (SESSACRE, dados
não-publicados). Também no ano 2000, de janeiro a dezembro, os
índices de infestação predial pelo Aedes aegypti na cidade de Rio
Branco variaram de 0% a 16,47% (média de 3,5%), conforme o
bairro pesquisado (SESSACRE-DABS, dados não-publicados).

Quando do segundo levantamento soroepidemiológico (janeiro
de 2000), a curva epidêmica da dengue poderia estar com a
incidência de nível endêmico, mas não ainda em fase de progressão
ou que pode ter começado a ocorrer no segundo semestre de 2000.
Porque, não só considerando o conhecimento sobre as curvas
epidêmicas da dengue23, os casos notificados foram mais freqüentes
a partir de novembro e dezembro de 2000 e a incidência máxima da
epidemia na terceira semana epidemiológica (janeiro) de 2001,
simultaneamente pelos sorotipos DEN-1 e DEN-2, quando foram
confirmados 410 dos 445 casos notificados na cidade de Rio Branco4.

Mais recentemente, nas cidades de Brasiléia e Epitaciolândia,
na divisa com a cidade de Cobija (Bolívia), também foram
confirmados casos autóctones de DEN-1 e DEN-24. Por isto, vale
ressaltar a observação dos 6 (3,2%) casos com anticorpos contra o
sorotipo DEN-3 em janeiro de 2000, sendo anteriormente (agosto
de 1999) soronegativos para esse mesmo sorotipo. Oficialmente, o
DEN-3 foi isolado no Brasil em dezembro de 2000 na cidade do Rio
de Janeiro12, seguido por isolamentos subseqüentes ou de epidemias
em populações de cidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil3.
Portanto, o registro de soropositivos (IH) para o DEN-3 em amostras
séricas extraídas em janeiro de 2000 é digno de nota, especialmente
porque foram em pessoas residentes em região distante daquelas
localidades das regiões Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil. Contudo, vale
também ressaltar, apesar do isolamento geográfico do Estado do
Acre, muitas das cidades do Vale do Acre, inclusive Rio Branco, têm
grande intercâmbio de pessoas e mercadorias com a cidade de
Cobija (Estado de Pando, Bolívia), onde há aeroporto internacional
e com possibilidade de comunicação aérea com outros centros
urbanos da América Latina e onde há circulação do DEN-313.

Apesar do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil recomendar, há mais
de três décadas, a vacinação contra o vírus vacinal (17D) da febre
amarela nas populações residentes na região Norte do País,
especialmente aquelas residentes nas pequenas localidades ou em
áreas de floresta nativa, onde há maior risco de exposição ao ciclo
silvestre do vírus da febre amarela24, somente 27,2% da população
estudada tinha soroproteção contra o vírus amaralíco na amostra
sérica de agosto de 1999. Isto tem ainda maior relevância, porque
é sabido que as pessoas vacinadas mantém títulos de anticorpos
protetores por longos períodos de tempo15, mesmo entre residentes
de áreas sem programa regular de vacinação22. Por outro lado, a
baixa freqüência (27,2%) de portadores de anticorpos anti-17D
mostrou não só a vulnerabilidade da população ao vírus da febre
amarela, antes da campanha de vacinação em massa de 1999, bem

como os precários resultados obtidos com as medidas
governamentais até então praticadas.

No entanto, nas amostras séricas de três meses após a vacinação em
massa contra o vírus 17D, em outubro de 1999, a soroconversão observada
foi de 89,7% entre aqueles inicialmente soronegativos. Nessa Campanha
Estadual de Vacinação, do Governo do Estado do Acre e com o apoio da
Fundação Nacional de Saúde, foram vacinadas 416.267 pessoas em todo o
Estado, correspondendo à época a 82,6% da população estimada como
não-imune (n=504.023), excluindo os menores de 6 meses de idade e as
gestantes. Portanto, essas taxas de cobertura vacinal (82,6%) e de
soroconversão (89,7%), bem como o contingente de pessoas previamente
imunes (27,2%), tornam possível especular que a quase totalidade das
pessoas residentes no Estado do Acre em outubro de 1999 esteja imune
contra o vírus da febre amarela. Isto provavelmente ocorreu de modo
uniforme, no grupo populacional com indicação de receber a vacina,
considerando as distribuições semelhantes de sexo e idade dos portadores
de anticorpos anti-17D em janeiro de 2000. Ao contrário do observado
entre aqueles pesquisados em agosto de 1999, quando predominaram as
pessoas do sexo masculino e de maior idade, o que pode evidenciar o
efeito dessas pessoas saberem ser mais expostas ao ciclo silvestre da febre
amarela e, conseqüentemente, buscaram mais a vacinação.

Não obstante, seria mais indicado o teste de neutralização (TN),
por ser mais sensível e específico, para avaliar a soroconversão
pela vacina antiamarílica e usando como substrato cultura de células
ou camundongos recém-nascidos (PFC Vasconcelos, informação
pessoal). No entanto, o TN, se comparado ao teste de inibição da
hemaglutinação, tem como principais limitações em estudos soro-
epidemiológicos o custo mais elevado e também, especialmente se
for usados camundongos recém-nascidos, o tempo despedido para
conclusão dos exames sorológicos, além de requerer biotério com
capacidade de fornecer grande número de animais.

O custo-benefício da elevada taxa de cobertura vacinal na
população da cidade de Rio Branco, e por extensão do Estado do
Acre, deve ser também avaliado considerando a proteção duradoura
oferecida por essa vacina, ou de pelo menos 10 anos15, e o atual
risco de urbanização do vírus da febre amarela11, o que tem
merecido reiterados alertas as autoridades de saúde do Brasil5 11 16 24,
decorrente da elevada dispersão do Ae. aegypti em grande parte das
cidades brasileiras, à semelhança do observado nas áreas de maior
densidade populacional do Estado do Acre.

Adicionalmente, em todo o Estado do Acre não ocorreu aumento
da incidência de encefalopatias, de encefalites ou de outro evento
adverso conhecido25 nos dias subseqüentes à aplicação em massa
da vacina 17D (SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados). Entre as
416.267 pessoas vacinadas contra o 17D em outubro de 1999, em
todo o Estado do Acre, somente foi notificado um caso (homem, de
26 anos, previamente sadio) que desenvolveu abscesso piogênico
no local da aplicação da vacina, que evoluiu para sepse e faleceu,
dezesseis dias após a vacinação, com falência múltipla de órgãos
(SESSACRE/DABS, dados não-publicados).

Provavelmente pelo efeito do viés de recordação, não houve
diferença da soropositividade para o 17D entre aqueles com ou sem
história de vacinação prévia a agosto de 1999. Ao contrário,
possivelmente por ser um evento mais recente, a história de
vacinação (em outubro de 1999) foi muito mais lembrada pelos

Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 37:1-6, jan-fev, 2004

soropositivos para o 17D na amostra sérica de janeiro de 2000.
Contudo, além do baixo valor preditivo-positivo da história de
vacinação, observada no levantamento de agosto de 1999, não é
hábito da população guardar a caderneta de vacinação ou mesmo
levá-la à unidade de imunização por ocasião da aplicação de uma
nova dose de vacina, isto porque somente uma (0,3%) pessoa a
apresentou quando da aplicação da primeira dose (agosto de 1999)
da vacina contra o vírus da hepatite B. Essa situação fica ainda
mais evidente ao constatar que somente 39,5% das pessoas tinham
aquela caderneta em janeiro de 2000, ou seja, isto após 5 meses do
início da Campanha Estadual de Intensificação do Calendário de
Imunizações, que mobilizou ampla parcela da população do Estado
do Acre, e com maciça divulgação nos vários tipos de mídia.

Como estes resultados observados sobre a caderneta de vacinação
são semelhantes aos descritos nos Estados da Bahia20 e de Minas
Gerais1, há fortes indícios sobre a inadequação dessa prática de
registro e, por isto mesmo, os gestores do Sistema Único de Saúde
deveriam estudar melhor estratégia de registro e/ou de
armazenamento de dados, de mais fácil verificação, e que cobrisse,
ao menos, as vacinas constantes do Programa Nacional de
Imunização.

Em conclusão, a população estudada tem aparentemente menor
exposição aos arbovírus mais prevalentes na região amazônica
brasileira e, apesar de potencialmente mais exposta ao vírus da
febre amarela, tinha, antes da campanha de vacinação, baixa taxa
de cobertura vacinal contra o vírus 17D. De outro lado, os índices
atuais de infestação do Ae aegypti, os determinantes econômicos e
sócioculturais e a evidência sorológica de circulação do DEN-3,
tornam a população do Estado do Acre potencialmente exposta a
outra epidemia de dengue pelo sorotipo 3 (DEN-3).

INTRODUCTION 
LOUPING ill (LI), traditionally a disease of sheep and 
less frequently cattle, occurs in Scotland, northern 
England, Wales and Ireland. The aetiological agent is 
a flavivirus which is transmitted under natural conditions 
by the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. 

Although clinical LI has previously been described in 
the horse (Fletcher, 1937), there have been no virologically 
confirmed cases reported in this species. A limited 
serological survey to determine the prevalence of serum 
neutralising antibodies to  LI virus in horses in Ireland, 
disclosed a positive rate of 10.6 per cent, indicating a 
moderate infection rate in  animals of mixed breed and 
of different environmental backgrounds (Timoney, 
1974). 

This paper contains a description of an outbreak of 
LI in a group of free range horses and the isolation of a 
virus, antigenically indistinguishable from a reference 
strain of LI virus, from the brain and spinal cord of one 
of the animals. It has already been the subject of a 
preliminary report (Timoney, Donnelly, Clements and 
Fenlon, 1974). 

CLINICAL HISTORY 
The group of horses in which LI was confirmed 

comprised a 12 year old (y.0.) hunter, a 3 y.0. ?,-bred 
mare, a 3 y.0. draft mare and a 3 y.0. h-bred mare. 
The animals which were unbroken and scarcely handled 
since they were foals, were grazing on a farm of reclaimed 
land in Co. Clare. Almost 15 years previously losses 
from LI infection had occurred in sheep on this farm. 
The horses involved in the present outbreak were checked 
daily for signs of ill health. 
Case I 

Clinical signs were first noticed in the &-bred mare 
when inspected at 06.30 h on 30.4.74. At rest there 
were generalised muscular tremors, most pronounced 
in the left forelimb which also tended to knuckle over. 
The animal moved reluctantly when approached and 
muscular tremors recommenced when she stopped. 
On the following day the mare was recumbent and when 
forced to rise would walk a short distance and lie down 
again. Five to 6 hours later, she had difficulty in rising 
and exhibited hyperexcitability, incoordination and 
opisthotonus. An hour afterwards the mare was 
caught for the first time and became so excited that she 

was given as a sedative, an intravenous injection of 
magnesium sulphate. She died 10 minutes later approx- 
imately 32 hours after the initial symptoms were detected. 

Case 2 
At the end of April, the 3 y.0. &-bred mare developed 

a peculiar gait and when in motion, stretched out her 
neck in an exaggerated extended position. However, 
these clinical signs subsided in a short time. The owner 
felt that had the &bred mare not been sick, the transient 
symptoms shown by the &-bred mare would have passed 
unnoticed. 
Case 3 

During the second week in May, the 3 y.0. draft mare 
was observed remaining apart from the other horses. 
The animal had been losing condition for over a month. 
The mare tended to lie down a lot and when roused, 
would adopt a dog-sitting position. Having gained her 
feet she would take some time steadying herself and 
occasionally experienced generalised muscular tremors. 
At times, the mare would stagger around but at no stage 
were hyperexcitability, opisthotonus, or paddling of the 
limbs evident. The mare was often recumbent during 
the week preceding her death which occurred on 22.5.74. 
The duration of the illness was approximately 10-12 days. 

FIN DI NGS 
POST-MORTEM AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL 

In  Case 1 there were interlobular pulmonary oedema 
and serosanguineous pleural exudate. The meningeal 
blood vessels were congested. An ulcerative typhlitis 
associated with many Anoplocephala perfoliata was 
present in both cases, and was the only macroscopic 
abnormality observed in Case 3. The entire brain 
from Case 1 and one half of the brain from Case 3 
were fixed in 10 per cent formol saline for histopath- 
ological examination. The remainder of the brain from 
Case 3 was immersed in 50 per cent glycerol saline for 
virological examination. 

After fixation, blocks of cerebrum, cerebellum, 
midbrain, medulla, and cervical cord from both cases, 
were processed to paraffin. Sections were cut at 7 pm 
and were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). 

The lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) were 
typical of those encountered in viral encephalitides, 
namely neuronal degeneration, focal gliosis and peri- 
vascular lymphoid infiltration. 



I I4  

Case I 
Congestion, perivascular lymphoid infiltration and 

glial nodules were present at all levels of the CNS 
examined. Glial nodules were particularly numerous 
in the midbrain, around the cerebral aqueduct (fig. I )  
and in the red nuclei. The oculomotor nuclei were 
unaffected. Some of the cerebellar folia were severely 
involved with marked perivascular haemorrhages in- 
volving both the granular layer and the white matter 
(fig. 2) .  Haemorrhages were also present in the medulla 
and spinal cord.

Lesions in this case were less pronounced. The 
midbrain was most severely affected with perivascular 
infiltration and glial nodules particularly in the central 
grey matter (fig. 3). In the cerebellum, there were areas 
of Purkinje cell loss accompanied by diffuse glial reaction 
and endothelial reactivity in the molecular layer (fig. 4). 
Lesions in the medulla and cervical cord were sparse. 
Some perivascular cuffing and satellitosis were present 
in the medulla and a few glial nodules in the white matter 
of the cervical cord. There was some post-mortem 
degeneration in the tissues from this case. 12 

VIROLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Virus Isolation 

Clarified 10 per cent suspensions were separately 
prepared from 6 areas of the brain of Case 2, the 3 y.0. 
draft mare. These included : anterior cerebral cortex.

Two mice in each of the 3 groups injected with pons, 
medulla, and cervical cord suspensions became sick 
5-6 days after inoculation. Re-isolation of the virus, 
designated 74/E/61, from the same areas of the horse 
brain were successful. Weanling mice inoculated with 
the isolate by the i.c. and intraperitoneal routes, all 
developed posterior paraplegia by the sixth day post 
inoculation. 
Virus Characterisation and Identification 

Haemagglutinating ( H A )  activity. Crude alkaline 
aqueous antigens prepared from first and second passage 
mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 virus were tested fcr 
HA activity over pH range 5.8-6.8 and each was negative. 
However, a haemagglutinin of titre ! /320, was sub- 
sequently obtained from second passage infective mouse 
brain using sucrose-acetone and acetone-ether extraction 
procedures. The preparation of crude and purified 
antigens and the techniaue of HA titration were as 
deschbed by Clarke and 'Casals (1958) adapted to the 

, microtechnique of Sever (1962). 



EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL 

Mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid was produced 
against 74/E/61 virus after the method of Brandt, 
Buescher and Hetrick (1967). The equine isolate was 
preliminarily identified as a strain of LI virus using the 
gel diffusion (GD) test (Papadopoulos, Anslow and 
Hanson, 1970). Lines of complete identity were obtained 
with low passage mouse brain infected with 74/E/61 
virus and suckling mouse brain infected with the More- 
dun strain of LI virus. The identity of the equine 
isolate was confirmed in cross complement-fixation 
(CF) tests (Bradstreet and Taylor, 1962) and in cross 
haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests (Clarke and 
Casals, 1958). 

Cross neutralisation tests were undertaken to determine 
the extent of the antigenic similarity between 74/E/61 
virus and the Moredun strain of LI virus. The test 
method has previously been described (Timoney, 1974). 

The results of cross neutralisation tests revealed that 
both reference and 74/E/61 viruses were antigenically 
indistinguishable, with homologous and heterologous 
neutralisation indices differing by less than one log of 
virus neutralised (Table I ) .

Serological Testing 
Blood samples were collected from the $-bred mare 

and the hunter on 21.5.74 and 9.6.74 and from the draft 
mare on 21.5.74, the day preceding its death. Antibody 
to 74/E/61 virus was detected in all of the sera using 
the neutralisation, CF, HI and G D  tests. There were 
significant rises in titre between first and second samples 
in the case of the &bred mare and the hunter (Table 11). 

DISCUSSION 
Although there is serological evidence of LI infection 

in horses in Ireland (Timoney, 1974), clinical disease 
associated with such infections is very uncommon. It 
is interesting to compare the clinical features of this 
outbreak with those described in other recorded cases 
of experimental or natural LI infection in the horse 
(Alexander and Neitz, 1935; Fletcher, 1937). In both 
instances, there was no attendant mortality. Alexander 
and Neitz (1935) experimentally infected 2 horses with 
LI virus by infesting them with infected Rhipicephalus 
appendiculutus nymphs. One animal was afebrile and 
showed only slight paresis, which appeared 2 weeks 
after challenge and persisted for several weeks. The 
second animal developed a biphasic fever, was anorexic,

tucked up and polypnoeic, with cyanotic mucous 
membranes, a weak pulse and profuse diarrhoea. No 
nervous signs appeared and the horse made an uneventful 
recovery. 

In the clinical report by Fletcher (1937), a 2 y.0. 
Clydesdale colt grazing on hill pasture with 2 other 
horses developed stiffness in gait, especially in the 
hind limbs. This was accompanied by a moderate 
fever, marked nervous tension, head thrust forward, 
fore-legs lifted abnormally high when made to walk 
and slight twitching of the facial muscles. The colt 
had fully recovered after an illness of 12 days duration. 
Alteration in gait and thrusting forward of the head 
were also seen in the 3 y.0. :-bred in the present out- 
break. The nervous signs exhibited by the 2 mares 
which died were quite different and have not been 
previously described in LI in the horse. Whether the 
death of the $-bred mare after a brief illness of 1-2 days, 
was brought about by the intravenous administration 
of magnesium sulphate a short time beforehand or not, 
is conjectural. Certainly the fulminating character of 
the disease and the severity of the nervous signs which 
were observed, suggest that death would have supervened 
in a relatively short period of time irrespective of any 
medication. The variation in clinical response observed 
in this outbreak of LI infection is no different to that 
described for other equine arboviral diseases affecting 
the CNS e.g. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis 
(Kissling, et at., 1956), Western equine encephalomyelitis 
(Sponseller, et al., 1966) and West Nile encephalomyelitis 
(Joubert, et al., 1970). 

The lesions observed on histopathological examination 
of the brains of the i-bred mare and the draft mare 
were typical of viral encephalomyelitis. The difference 
in the severity of the lesions in the 2 horses was no 
greater than that seen in many field cases of LI in sheep. 
The lack of polymorphonuclear reaction differentiated 
this encephalitis from Eastern equine encephalomyelitis 
as described by Hurst (1934). Distribution of lesions 
in Borna disease in which the spinal cord is not involved, 
and in which the oculomotor nuclei rather than the 
red nuclei of the midbrain are affected (Innes and 
Saunders, 1962), is quite different. 



I I6 

The results of the virological investigations confirm 
the importance of checking several areas of the brain 
when attempting virus isolation. The recovery of LI 
virus only from the pons, medulla, and cervical cord can 
be compared with the finding of Doherty and Reid 
(1971), that in sheep experimentally infected with LI 
virus by the subcutaneous route, the highest concentra- 
tions of virus are to be found in the brain stem and 
spinal cord. The ability of virus to survive in brain 
tissue even in the presence of high levels of homologous 
serum antibody, has been noted previously. In acute 
cases of experimental LI infection in sheep, Reid, 
Doherty and Dawson (1971) have reported high levels 
of specific IgM and IgG in cerebrospinal fluid and have 
in every case isolated the virus from nervous tissue. 

The properties of 74/E/61 virus isolated from the 
brain of the draft mare, were indistinguishable from 
those of a reference strain of LI virus. Failure to  
,demonstrate a haemagglutinin in a number of crude 
mouse brain antigens confirms the observation of 
Timoney (1971), that less than one third of such antigens 
prepared from field isolates of LI virus have HA activity. 
Purification of infective mouse brain by sucrose-acetone 
or acetone-ether extraction procedures had to be resorted 
to before a HA antigen was obtained. Even though no 
antigenic difference could be detected between equine 
and reference strains of virus, it is possible that 74/E/6I 
virus possessed biological properties enhancing its 
virulence for the horse. This possibility is presently 
being investigated. 

A significant rise in antibody titre to LI virus was 
detected by neutralisation test in the case of the $-bred 
mare, and by HI and GD tests in the case of the hunter. 
The advisability of carrying out more than one serological 
assay method is evident. 

This outbreak of LI infection when considered in 
conjunction with an antibody prevalence rate of 10.6 per 
cent in non-Thoroughbred horses in Ireland (Timoney, 
I974), would indicate that further studies are required 
to determine the importance of L1 virus in the aetiology 
of equine neurological disorders and to evaluate the 
epidemiological importance of the horse in the natural 
history of this virus. 

SUMMARY 
An outbreak of LI infection in a group of free range 

horses is described. Three of 4 horses displayed signs 
of CNS disturbance and 2 of these died after illnesses 
ranging from 2-12 days duration. In both cases a 
variable degree of viral polioencephalomyelitis was 
observed. 

A virus antigenically indistinguishable from a 
reference strain of L1 virus was isolated from the brain 
and cervical cord of a 3 y.0. draft mare. Serum samples 
obtained from 3 of the horses contained HI, CF, pre- 
cipitating and neutralising antibodies to LI virus, 
with a rise in antibody titre being demonstrated in 2 
animals.

The authors describe their search for a method to reliably record cardiac responses to exercise based on electrocardiographic 
techniques. Initially the question of electrode placement and design led to the development of silver electrodes suspended in perspex 
annuli attached to the forehead and loins using a proprietary adhesive. Several systems for recording cardiac electrical activity were 
tested. A heart rate meter proved inadequate through poor definition of QRS complexes and doubling whenever the T wave was 
large. Traditional radio-telemetry using standard equipment was unreliable owing to  unexpected artifacts such as shadowing of the 
transmitter by the rider and interference from the rider’s walkie-talkie recording system. The system finally adopted employed a 
stereo cassette tape recorder tied to the rider’s back in which a dual channel pulse with modulation technique was used, thus enabling 
effective filtering of mechanical vibration artifacts upon demodulation of the signal. Relevant circuit diagrams are given and the 
experimental procedure described.

This paper describes investigation of the immunity produced in horses to challenge by Streptococcus rqui and a commercial 

Str. equi vaccine commonly used in Australia. Immunity was assayed by an in vitro bactericidal test, using the production of 
bactericidal (opsonic) antibodies against cell wall (M) antigens and a test which measured the ability of the test serum to elicit a long 
chain formation response. These tests are used in correlation to measure immunity to type A Streptococcal infection in man and 
expert opinion suggests that the tests are applicable to Str. equi and are highly type specific. Opinion also suggests that there is a 
good correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunity using these two tests. 

Results confirmed the recommendation 
of the vaccine producers that the three dose primary vaccination regime was necessary to give good initial protection in all horses 
vaccinated. Occasionally however, for reasons not discussed, individual horses did not respond satisfactorily to  vaccination. The 
duration of immunity following vaccination also was variable and some horses had low titres by 3 months post vaccination. The 
author recommends a booster vaccination at  12 months and found a good anamnestic response at  that time. Some horses with 
high pre-vaccinia1 titres showed intense pain and stiffness following vaccination. 

Natural infection produced antibody titres which had fallen to low levels by 9 weeks in most horses. This suggested that natural 
immunity was short lived and reinfection can occur at  intervals as short as 6 months. However, even with low titres, further challenge 
produced a good anamnestic response and this may account for the protection often seen in the field in older horses. Natural immunity 
relies upon repeated challenge either by natural or  artificial challenge. Without this, horses of any age are susceptible to infection. 
The carrier state, when it  occurs, may serve as a natural method of specific immunisation. 

Results from horses with respiratory infection caused by atypical Str. equi suggested that immunity was highly type specific. 
It would be interesting to know the effect of vaccination in clinical situations of atypical Str. equi infection. In the rzviewers experience, 
“typical” clinical cases are frequently assorted with “atypical” bacteriological findings and vice versa. One imagines that vaccination 
under these circumstances would not always give the desired clinical protection.

ANTIGENIC RELATIONSHIPS OF FLAVIVIRUSES WITH
UNDETERMINED ARTHROPOD-BORNE STATUS*

Abstract. In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with
undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with
excreta (saliva, urine, fÃ¨ces,etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles
may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and
recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity ti-
trations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary PÃ©kinduck embryo cells, and
antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutrali
zation tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties
delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those
which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey menin-
goencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five anti
genic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents
or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh
bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, TamaÃ±abat
and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk
and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in
mosquito cells in vitro.

Although 44 of the registered flaviviruses have
been isolated principally or exclusively from mos
quitoes or ticks, the remaining 17 have never been
recovered from wild-caught arthropods.1 These 17

flaviviruses, isolated primarily from bats and ro
dents, may be true arboviruses, transmitted in as
yet undefined vectors. Alternatively, they may
have maintained a primitive mode of direct trans
fer using saliva,2"4 aerosols,5 milk,6 urine7"9 or

transplacental transmission. These flaviviruses
may represent 1) descendents of ancestral viruses
which have not adapted to replication in inver
tebrates or 2) viruses which have evolved to an
existence now independent of a vector interme
diate.4- 10

areas of south Texas. A number of strains of St.
Louis encephalitis virusâ€”a proven arbovirusâ€”
were also included as controls. An attempt was
made to correlate antigenic relationships with geo
graphic distribution and potential for arthropod
transmission.

In this paper, we shall use the term "flaviviruses
with undetermined arthropod-borne status"

(FUAS) when referring to those viruses already
described. We recognize that some FUAS, e.g.,
Koutango and Israel turkey meningoencephalitis,
may eventually be shown to be transmitted by
arthropod vectors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Viruses and virus titrations

Known histories of the viruses used in these
studies are presented in Table 1. Stock virus was
prepared as clarified 10% or 20% suspensions of
suckling mouse (SM) brain in phosphate buffered
saline (pH 7.3) containing 4% bovine albumin.

Virus seeds were titrated in 2- to 4-day-old SM
and endpoints calculated by the method of Reed
and Muench.19 Plaque formation was determined

in primary PÃ©kinduck embryo (DE) and contin
uous rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK,) or Afri
can green monkey kidney (Vero) cells; titers were
recorded as plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of
inoculum.

For production of immune ascitic fluids, adult
mice were given four immunizing doses in com
plete Freund's adjuvant, as described by Tika-
singh et al.2"

Inoculation of mosquito cell cultures

In order to provisionally assess the potential of
these FUAS for replication in mosquitoes, an in
vitro system was used. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus)
cells21were inoculated with an approximate 1,000

PFU of each of 20 FUAS. St. Louis encephalitis
virus, strain TBH-28, a known mosquito-borne
virus, and Colorado tick fever virus, strain Florio,
a known tick-borne virus, were included as "pos
itive" and "negative" controls, respectively. C6/36

cells were collected in their own supernatant fluids

when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed or
on day 10, when uninoculated control C6/36 cell
cultures began to spontaneously degenerate. Har
vests were then titrated in LLC-MK> or Vero cells,
whichever cell line had given the highest titers in
previous tests.

Complement-fixation, hemagglutination,
and neutralization tests

Antigens for complement-fixation (CF) and
hemagglutination (HA) tests were prepared from
infected SM brains by sucrose-acetone extrac
tion.22 Infectious and beta propiolactone inacti

vated antigens were used in a microtiter adapta
tion of the LBCF5n test;23 antigens prepared by

these methods possess similar breadths of reactiv
ity.

Serum dilution plaque reduction neutralization
tests were performed as previously described.24
Virus-serum mixtures were incubated for approx
imately 18 hours at 4Â°Cbefore inoculation of cell

monolayers. All except SLE virus-infected cul
tures received double agar overlays, with 1:25,000
neutral red in the second overlay.

RESULTS

Biologic properties

Titers of FUAS in mice and cell cultures are
shown in Table 2. Titers in SM were from 168'9
to IO1"-1icLD5l(/ml.Average survival times ranged
from 4-10 days.

Aroa, Entebbe bat, Israel turkey meningoen
cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya, and Sokuluk vi
ruses produced distinct plaques in Vero cells; Apoi,
Batu Cave, Bukalasa bat, Carey Island, Cowbone
Ridge, Jutiapa, Montana Myotis leucoencephali-
tis, Negishi, Phnom Penh bat, Rio Bravo, and
TamaÃ±abat viruses produced indistinct plaques,
and the remainder failed to plaque in these cells.
All but Entebbe bat and Saboya viruses produced
distinct plaques in LLC-MK2 cells; titers ranged
from IO44to 10"M PFU/ml. Israel turkey menin

goencephalitis and Koutango viruses produced
clear plaques in primary DE cells. Aroa, Dakar
bat, Entebbe bat, Modoc, Montana Myotis leu-
coencephalitis, Negishi, Rio Bravo, and Saboya
viruses formed indistinct plaques, and the rest
failed to plaque in these cells.

virus were selected from a variety of SLE virus
isolates of mammalian and mosquito origin and
from various locations and collection dates. These
were tested in order to select what might be con
sidered representative biological variants, based
upon unusually low or high titers in SM or DE
cells or unusual plaque morphology or delayed ap
pearance of plaques in DE cells. Since some of
these strains were from rodents it was thought not
unlikely that one or more of these strains might
have characteristics more similar to FUAS than
to prototype SLE virus. However, titers in SM
ranged from IO7-2to IO10"3icLD5(l/mland average
survival times from 4-7 days. All 12isolates formed
plaques in DE cells with titers from IO6-"to IO9-2

PFU/ml; plaques were of uniform morphology and
apparent by the 3rd day after inoculation. There
fore, only four (Table 1) of the 12 strains were
used in further comparisons.

Replication in mosquito cell cultures

As summarized in Table 3, C6/36 cells showed
CPE 9 days after inoculation with SLE virus, a

known mosquito-borne flavivirus, and with Israel
turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango and Sa
boya viruses, 5, 9, and 9 days after inoculation,
respectively. Since virus replication could occur
without CPE, C6/36 cell harvests were titrated in
a sensitive indicator cell culture (LLC-MK, or Vero
cells) by plaque assay. All four viruses which
caused CPE in C6/36 cells titered IO5Â°PFU/ml or

greater. In addition, Aroa, Entebbe bat and Sok
uluk viruses replicated to low levels (IO2-7'3-0PFU/

ml) in the mosquito cell line.

Hemagglutinin activity

Antigens for all but two viruses (Carey Island
and TamaÃ±abat) were shown to possess hemag-
glutinin activity. The pH optima ranged from 5.9
to 6.8; most optima were below pH 6.5. Excep
tions were Aroa (pH 6.7), Koutango (pH 6.6), Sa
boya (pH 6.8), and Sokuluk (pH 6.8) viruses.

Hemagglutinin activity optima for two of the
four SLE virus strains used in these studies had
pH optima 6.6 (BeAn 246262 (pH 6.5) and CorAn
9124 (pH 6.3)).

Complement fixation tests

Table 4 summarizes the results of cross CF tests.
Nearest antigenic neighbors are presented contig
uously. When heterologous antibody titer differed
more than fourfold from the homologous titer of
the virus with which it was compared, it was con
sidered a significant difference.

Complement-fixation test results may be sum
marized as follows:

1. Despite the high potency of immune fluids
to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Aroa, Carey Island,
and Koutango viruses, significant relationships
with other FUAS were not observed.

2. Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus was
reactive one-way with SLE virus strains TBH-28
and 246262.

3. Batu Cave and Phnom Penh bat viruses re
acted reciprocally to high titer, and could not be
distinguished from one another.

4. Antibody to Cowbone Ridge virus, although
of low titer, reacted with Sokuluk, SLE strain

BeAn 246262, and Sal Vieja* viruses. Jutiapa vi
rus was found to be related one-way to San Perlita
and MA-387-72 viruses. MA-387-72 and San Per
lita* viruses were reciprocally cross-reactive to high

titers.
5. Sal Vieja antiserum reacted to high titer with

MA-387-72, San Perlita, and Cowbone Ridge vi
ruses.

6. Antibody to Rio Bravo virus cross-reacted
principally with Apoi and San Perlita antigens.

7. Antibody to Dakar bat virus reacted only
with Bukalasa bat and Apoi antigens, and then
at a barely detectable level.

8. Antibodies to Bukalasa bat, Montana My
otis leucoencephalitis, Negishi, and TamaÃ±abat
viruses reacted significantly only with homologous
antigens. Negishi antigen, however, titered to
within eightfold of homologous antibody to Israel
turkey meningoencephalitis virus.

* Mention here of this virus designation is not intend
ed to constitute priority.

Neutralization tests

Table S summarizes results of neutralization (N)
tests with viruses which were shown to be closely
related by CF. The N test results may be sum
marized as follows:

1. Antibody to Apoi, Saboya, Sokuluk, Israel
turkey meningoencephalitis, Aroa, Bukalasa bat,
Dakar bat, Entebbe bat, Koutango, Negishi, and
Rio Bravo viruses significantly neutralized only
homologous virus. Bukalasa bat virus is distinct
from the other viruses tested.

2. SLE strain SPAn 8678 reacts in one direction
with Aroa virus.

3. The reciprocal neutralization of Batu Cave
and Phnom Penh bat viruses indicates that they
are strains of the same virus rather than distinct
prototypes.

4. Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Modoc, San Per
lita and Sal Vieja viruses are interrelated but an-
tigenically distinct. San Perlita and strain MA-
387-72 were reciprocally cross-neutralized and ap
pear to represent two isolates of a single, newly
recognized virus.

perhaps not strictly comparable, serologie tests.
The uniform comparisons reported here provide
complete relationships between all the viruses
tested and allow a precise definition of antigenic
relationships, at least insofar as concerns the re
agents used. Virulence of these viruses in SM and
in LLC-MK.2, Vero and C6/36 cell lines, and in
DE cells was determined. Infactivity titers in SM
were generally higher than in cell cultures. Pro
longed survival of laboratory mice infected with
many of these viruses may reflect long-standing
adaptations to mammalian hosts. Most of the
FUAS produced distinct plaques in LLC-MK2
cells, with the exception of Entebbe bat (in con
trast to earlier reports25) and Saboya viruses. Our
finding that LLC-MK, cells, in general, are su
perior for the replication of these agents confirms
previous observations.25'26 Davis and Hardy were

able to plaque Modoc virus in Vero cells,27where

as we were not; this observation may reflect a
difference between their cells and ours.

Israel turkey meningoencephalitis and Koutan-
go viruses, as well as 12 strains of SLE virus,
formed discrete plaques in DE cells. This may be
indicative of adaptation to avian hosts.28 Most of

the FUAS failed to produce plaques in DE cells,
possibly a reflection of adaptation to mammalian
reservoir hosts.

Epidemiologie evidence suggests that Israel tur
key meningoencephalitis virus is arthropod-borne,
since avian outbreaks of encephalitis caused by
this virus occur seasonally, coinciding with peak
arthropod activity.29 Also, it replicates in Aedes
albopictus cells3"and is maintained for as long as

30 days in Ae. aegypti and Culex pipiens molestus
mosquitoes, although transmission rates vary.12-31

In addition to Israel turkey meningoencephalitis
virus, Koutango virus replicated in C6/36 cells.
Coz et al.28 have documented experimental trans

mission of Koutango virus by Ae. aegypti mos
quitoes infected by intrathoracic inoculation, ar
tificial feeding, and feeding on viremic hosts.
Koutango virus has also been shown to be trans-
ovarially transmitted by Ae. aegypti.32 If any cor

relation exists between replication in C6/36 cells
and in mosquitoes, then Israel turkey meningoen
cephalitis, Koutango, Saboya and probably Aroa,
Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses are arthropod-
borne. Replication, with or without CPE in C6/
36 cells, may be an indication of the potential for
replication of viruses in mosquito cells in vivo.

Aroa virus was initially isolated from a sentinel
hamster and therefore is probably arthropod-
transmitted; it is related to Bussuquara virus in
CF tests (R. E. Shope, personal communication,

1979) and is neutralized by antibody to Bussu
quara strain BeAn 4073 and to SLE strain SPAn
8678 viruses; and replicates in C6/36 cells.

The second large cluster of FUAS includes those
isolated from rodents and bats and which may be
transmitted by direct contact. Transmission stud
ies with mosquitoes infected by intrathoracic in
oculation, artificial feeding, or feeding on infected
hosts have been unproductive for Saboya,28 Dakar
bat,28 Modoc,4-6 Rio Bravo,4-'" Apoi,1 Phnom
Penh bat,17 Entebbe and Bukalasa bat33 viruses.

In addition, Modoc, Apoi, and Rio Bravo viruses
failed to replicate in mosquito cell lines.3 Although

Carey Island, Entebbe bat, and Sokuluk viruses.
Antigenic relationships have been shown between
Saboya virus and certain mosquito-borne flavivi-
ruses of Africa, including Banzi, Bouboui, and
Uganda S viruses. ' While attempts to experimen
tally infect Ae. aegypti with Saboya virus by in-
trathoracic inoculation have failed,28 replication

in C6/36 cells (Table 3) may be indirect evidence
for replication in arthropods.

Apoi virus, isolated only from rodents in Japan,
fails to react appreciably with any of the other
viruses.

Considerable antigenic overlap occurs among
the FUAS of North and Central American ro
dents, in contrast to the antigenic distance be
tween Koutango and Saboya viruses isolated from
African rodents. Sal Vieja virus is antigenically
unique both by CF and N tests. In fact, based
upon CF and N data, an antigenic spectrum ap

pears to exist among Cowbone Ridge, Modoc, Sal
Vieja, San Perlita, and Jutiapa viruses. Cowbone
Ridge has been shown to be related to Modoc
virus13 which, in turn, shares antigens with San
Perlita prototype (and strain MA-387-72) as well
as Jutiapa viruses. Jutiapa, Cowbone Ridge, and
San Perlita viruses have been isolated from Sig-
modon hispidus in Guatemala, the Florida ever
glades, and Texas, respectively. Modoc from the
western United States and Canada and Sal Vieja
from Texas have been recovered from Peromys-
cus species.

The antigenic relatedness of Jutiapa to Cow-
bone Ridge virus may reflect their evolution in the
cricetid rodent host, S. hispidus. A similar asso
ciation between the South American cricetid ro
dents and at least seven arenaviruses in the Ta-
caribe complex relates Zoogeographie distribution
of host species to viral phytogeny. Ancestral Cri-



1282 VARELAS-WESLEY AND CALISHER

cetidae invaded South America from North Amer
ica during the Miocene-Pliocene epoch,34 and

evolved into a wide variety of forms. Simulta
neously, evolution of new arenaviruses occurred.
As Arata and Gratz have pointed out,35 the evo

lution of S. hispidus as a South American species
is certain from the Pleistocene record, and this
rodent is therefore a recent invader back into North
America. With this migration of S. hispidus, a
member of the Tacaribe serogroup (Tamiami vi
rus) may have been introduced to Florida. Anal
ogous with the arenaviruses, there are bunyavi
ruses and FUAS of Florida and Central and South
America which have been isolated from neotrop
ical cricetid and hystricomorph rodents and mar
supials in those places. Thus, Gumbo Limbo
(Group C), Shark River and Pahayokee (Patois
serogroup), and Mahogany Hammock (Guama
serogroup) bunyaviruses and the flavivirus, Cow-
bone Ridge, have been isolated in Florida; the
Latin American corollaries of these viruses are
Nepuyo, Patois and Zegla, CoAn 49888 and Ju-
tiapa viruses, respectively. It may be that, as with
the arenavirus Tamiami virus, cricetid rodents
reinvading North America were infected with vi
ruses from South America; or perhaps the viruses
had an earlier distribution in Florida but were
isolated from the neotropical habitat by geologic
changes.36

Antigenically unrelated viruses may utilize sim
ilar modes of nonarthropod enzootic dissemina
tion. Modoc virus, the most extensively studied of
the complex, was first isolated from the mammary
gland of Peromyscus maniculatus and has since
been shown to localize in mammary' tissue of lac-

tating female mice fed on SM infected with the
virus." Modoc virus has been recovered from sal

ivary glands, lungs, kidneys, throat swabs and
urine of rodents experimentally infected by sub
cutaneous or intranasal routes.6"9 Like Modoc,

Cowbone Ridge, Jutiapa, Sal Vieja and other
FUAS of rodents may also be transmitted inde
pendently of arthropod intermediates.

Most of the FUAS isolated from bats have been
isolated from salivary glands, yet no significant
antigenic relationships between these or other fla-
viviruses exist. Batu Cave, Phnom Penh bat, and
Carey Island viruses have all been isolated from
salivary glands of Cynopterus brachyotis (fruit-
eating bats) of Southeast Asia.1 Despite this, Ca

rey Island virus is more closely related to Dakar
bat and Saboya viruses. By contrast, Phnom Penh
bat and Batu Cave viruses are cross-reactive in

CF and N tests and therefore are strains of the
same virus. The nearly simultaneous registration
of these viruses precluded recognition of their an
tigenic similarity.1'17

Bukalasa bat, Dakar bat, and Entebbe bat vi
ruses have been isolated exclusively from salivary
glands of African bats.18 In CF tests, antibody to

Entebbe bat virus reacts to high titer only with
Sokuluk antigen, as reported by Lvov.37 It is in

teresting that both Entebbe bat and Sokuluk vi
ruses replicate in C6/36 cells.

Bukalasa bat and Dakar bat viruses are distinct
from one another by both CF and N tests, as ini
tially shown by Karabatsos.26 Serosurveys of in

sectivorous bat populations demonstrated a high
prevalence of antibodies to Dakar bat, Bukalasa
bat, and Entebbe bat viruses.37'38 The tropism of

these agents for vertebrate salivary glands, and
the failure of investigators to isolate them from
arthropods,14'33'38 suggest direct transmission by

biting or licking, or by aerosolized droplets.
Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis, TamaÃ±abat,

and Rio Bravo viruses of the Western Hemisphere
are also excreted in saliva of asymptomatic bats.
Despite years of field investigations in the enzootic
area, Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis virus has
not been isolated from mosquitoes or ticks.16 Rio

Bravo virus, ubiquitous in dense bat populations
roosting in poorly ventilated caves,5 is present in

salivary glands, kidneys, and mammary tissues of
experimental hosts" and has produced human in
fections, implying direct aerosol transmission.2-5

Attempts to incriminate bat ectoparasites as vec
tors were unsuccessful.5 The serologie studies re

ported here show these three isolates from insec
tivorous bats are minimally cross-reactive and
antigenically distinct. By CF, Montana Myotis
leucoencephalitis is antigenically remote from oth
er viruses tested, confirming previous studies.2"

Only when normal monkey serum was used as
diluent did neutralization of Rio Bravo virus by
antibody to Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis vi
rus occur.2" In contrast, Bell and Thomas report
ed one-way reactions by CF between Montana
Myotis leucoencephalitis, Entebbe bat, and SLE
(Parton strain) viruses.16 In this study, Rio Bravo

and SLE reacted reciprocally to low titer in CF
tests, in contrast to the high titer reactions re
ported by Sulkin and Allen2 who used guinea pig

hyperimmune sera.
In summary, the flaviviruses with undeter

mined arthropod-borne status may be broadly di
vided into two biologic groups; the first repre-

sented by Israel turkey meningoencephalitis,
Koutango, Negishi, and Aroa viruses. The second
includes viruses isolated exclusively from rodents
and bats and for which no evidence of vector in
termediates has been found; however, Saboya,
Sokuluk, and Entebbe bat viruses, replicate in
C6/36 cells. The Modoc-Rio Bravo antigenic com
plex of Johnson" is expanded to include, in addi

tion to Rio Bravo and Modoc viruses, Sal Vieja,
Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, and Apoi
viruses.

Phnom Penh bat, TamaÃ±abat, and Montana
Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses appear to be dis
tinct; sufficient data are not yet available to place
these three viruses into either of the above biologic
groupings.

Genome sequencing and virulence studies of 2 Jap-
anese encephalitis viruses (JEVs) from bats in Yunnan, 
China, showed a close relationship with JEVs isolated from 
mosquitoes and humans in the same region over 2 decades. 
These results indicate that bats may play a role in human 
Japanese encephalitis outbreaks in this region. 

Bats have been increasingly recognized as an important source of zoonotic viruses responsible for some of the 
recent major disease outbreaks, including Hendra, Nipah, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated, and Ebola 
viruses (1). Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mem-
ber of the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus (2) 
and is the etiologic agent of severe encephalitic diseases 
in humans. In addition to humans, JEV has been isolated 
from various hosts, e.g., mosquitoes, birds, pigs, and horses 
(3,4). The role of bats in JEV epidemiology has been poor-
ly defined, although the virus has been isolated from bats 
of various species since 1963 in multiple locations (5,6). To 
date, no nucleotide sequence information has been avail-
able for bat JEV isolates.

Yunnan Province, in southern China, has a tropical to 
subtropical climate and a diverse biota. The annual case 
rate of Japanese encephalitis in Yunnan is >2× the aver-
age case rate of the whole country (7). We report the mo-
lecular and virulence characterization of 2 bat JEV isolates 
from Yunnan: B58, obtained from a Leschenault’s rousette 
(Rousettus leschenaultia), a fruit bat, in 1989; and GB30, 
obtained from a little tube-nosed bat (Murina aurata), an 
insectivore, in 1997.

The Study
The viruses used in this study were isolated from ho-

mogenates of the brains of bats by direct intracranial (i.c.) 
inoculation of 3-day-old suckling mice. Although isolate 
B58 was obtained in 1989, no further identification or 
characterization was conducted until this study. GB30 was 
identified as JEV by serologic analysis (8). Inoculation in 
suckling mice was conducted following procedures ap-
proved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute for 
Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China. Mice were 
observed 2× per day after inoculation, and every 2 hours 
after the onset of clinical signs. After euthanasia, superna-
tant from brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 
cells. After the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), su-
pernatant was harvested and passaged 3 more times. Virus 
stock was prepared from the previous passage and stored 
at –85oC.

Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV strains and of a mos-
quito-derived JEV strain, M10 (9), were determined. All 
viruses were consecutively passed 3 times in mice, and 
virus suspension (defined as the 10–1 stock) was prepared 
from the third passage. For determination of a 50% lethal 
dose (LD50), suckling mice (5 per group) were inoculated 
i.c. with dilutions from 10–1 to 10–9. Animals were moni-
tored daily for survival, and the LD50 values were calcu-
lated by using a standard method (10).

Viral RNA was isolated by using the Viral RNA Mini 
Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). First strand cDNA was 
synthesized using the Ready-To-Go kit (Amersham Phar-
macia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Flavivirus-specific 
primers (11) and primers designed from the sequence of 
JEV Beijing-1 (L48916) were used for PCR and sequenc-
ing. Sequence assembly was conducted by using the ATGC 
software package, version 4.0 (GENETYX Corp., Tokyo, 
Japan). Homology and alignment analysis were con-
ducted by using ClustalX version 1.8 (www.clustal.org/
download/1.X/ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX) and 
MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). MEGA 3.1 
(12) was used for phylogenetic analysis.

For initial studies, suckling mice were inoculated i.c. 
with the supernatant of clarified brain homogenate. The 2 
groups (n = 8 for each) inoculated with B58 and GB30, re-
spectively, displayed clinical signs after 42 h postinocula-
tion (hpi), whereas the control group with buffer only (n = 
8) displayed no clinical signs. Clinical signs included refus-
ing sucking, no interest in grouping, neck rigidity, tremors 
and muscular spasms, ataxia, and hind-limb paralysis. All 
mice had to be euthanized from 70 to 78 hpi. The superna-
tant of brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells, 
and CPE was visible at ≈96 hpi for the first passage and at 
72 hpi for second and third passages.

The identity of B58 as JEV was confirmed by PCR 
sequencing. The complete genome sequence of both iso-
lates was then determined. The 2 genomes have identical 
size at 10,977 nt with a 95-nt 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) 
and a 583-nt 3′ NTR. The single open reading frame codes 
for a polyprotein of 3,432 aa. The genomes have similar 
guanine-cytosine content (51.44% for B58 and 51.39% for 
GB30).

The 2 bat JEV isolates have an overall sequence iden-
tity of 99.9% both at nt and aa levels. When compared to 55 
known JEV isolates of known complete genome sequenc-
es, the nt sequence identity varies from 88.6% to 99.3%, 
and aa sequence identity from 97.0% to 99.3%. Analysis of 
the NTR sequences showed that the bat JEV isolates have 
the same 5′ NTR as do the others, but the 3′ NTRs of the 
bat JEVs have a G insertion at nt 307, the same as that 
observed in the Nakayama strain (GenBank accession no. 
EF571853).

Phylogenetic trees derived from nucleotide sequences 
of the complete genome or the most variable envelope pro-
tein gene of selected JEV strains (Table 1) indicated that 
both JEV isolates from bats are members of genotype III as 

defined by Solomon et al. (3). A more detailed analysis in-
dicated that the bat JEVs are most closely related to human 
isolate LiYujie and mosquito isolate BN19 within cluster 
6 (Figure). Similar phylogenetic trees were obtained based 
on other gene sequences, such as PrM (data not shown).

Neurovirulence of the 2 bat JEV isolates was deter-
mined as described above, and the LD50 for suckling mice 
was 8.0 log10/0.02 mL, compared with 3.5 log10/0.02 mL 
for the mosquito strain M10. Neurovirulence of these 2 bat 
isolates also was predicted from aa sequence comparison 
to those known to have high neurovirulence (13,14). As 
shown in Table 2, all residues important for virulence and 
neurotropism were conserved between the bat JEV isolates 
and the Nakayama strain.

Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed the complete genome se-

quences of 2 bat JEV isolates.  Although previous serologic 
studies (15) have indicated the occurrence of JEV in a Le-
schenault’s rousette, we demonstrate JEV infection of Ma-
rina aurata bats, confirming that the same JEV genotype can 
infect bats of many species. Both bats are commonly present

JEV from Bats, China

in Yunnan Province and other parts of China. The bats tend 
to roost in trees, caves, and roofs of residential properties 
in close proximity to rice paddocks and pig pens, provid-
ing ample opportunity for cross-species transmission among 

bats and between bats and other animals. Notably, the 2 JEV 
strains most closely related to the bat viruses were all iso-
lated from Yunnan Province, LiYujie from a human in 1979 
and BN19 from mosquitoes in 1982 (Figure).

Our study indicates that the same virus is circulating in 
hosts of at least 4 different species (human, mosquito, and 2 
different bat species), and likely in birds as well, highlight-
ing the broad host range of JEVs in this area. We empha-
size that the 4 closely related strains (B58, GB30, LiYujie, 
and BN19) were isolated over 2 decades, which suggests 
that the virus was stably maintained in the region, perhaps 
by circulating in disparate hosts. The findings from our cur-
rent study highlight the potential importance of bats in hu-
man JE outbreaks in the region. Needed additional studies 
of JEV in bats should include the determination of viremia 
in bats of different species and potential seasonal variation 
of viral loads among different bats at different geographic 
locations. This data would provide a better assessment of 
risks posed by JEV in bats.

During investigations into an outbreak of egg production decline, retarded growth, and even death among
ducks in Southeast China, a novel Tembusu virus strain named Tembusu virus Fengxian 2010 (FX2010) was
isolated. This virus replicated in embryonated chicken eggs and caused embryo death. In cross-neutralization
tests, antiserum to the partial E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010, whereas
antiserum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not. FX2010 is an enveloped RNA virus of approximately 45–
50 nm in diameter. Sequence analysis of its E and NS5 genes showed that both genes share up to 99.6%
nucleotide sequence identity with Baiyangdian virus, and up to 88% nucleotide sequence identity with their
counterparts in Tembusu virus. FX2010was transmitted without mosquito, and caused systemic infection and
lesions in experimentally infected ducks. These results indicate that FX2010 and BYD virus are newly emerged
Tembusu virus strains that cause an infectious disease in ducks.

Introduction

In April 2010, an outbreak of shelduck infectious disease, of
unknown origin, caused death, retarded growth, high fever, loss of
appetite, and egg production decline. The outbreak was first detected
in Shanghai, China, but spread rapidly to all of the south–east
provinces of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Anhui. The
disease continued to transmit until winter, and the shelducks in the
provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were under
a huge threat by this unknown pathogen. Epizootic investigation
suggested that most susceptible animals to this pathogen were
shelducks, since infection of muscovy ducks and chickens was not
reported. The infection rate andmorbidity of shelducks was as high as
100% and mortality varied from 5% to 30% possibly due to secondary
bacterial infections. Postmortem examinations were performed and
revealed grossly swollen spleens and kidneys. To date, more than
10 million shelducks have been infected and approximately one mil-
lion have died. We isolated a causative agent from sick shelducks by
inoculating filtered spleen homogenates into the allantoic sacs of
embryonated chicken eggs. Here, we describe the properties of the
causative agent of this outbreak.

Results

Isolation of the causative agent in SPF embryonated chicken eggs

Since various antibiotics were used to mitigate the outbreak in
ducks without any success, the pathogenwas thought to be a virus. To
isolate the causative agent, a homogenate of the spleens of sick
shelducks was filtered through 0.22 um filters and inoculated into the
allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. All of the
embryos of the inoculated eggs died 2–6 days post-inoculation and
were severely swollen with edema (Fig. 1). The supernatant of the
homogenate of the embryos had an infectivity titer of 105.5 ELD50/mL.

Electron microscopy

The purified causative agent was examined by electron microscopy.

microscope upon negative staining.

Physicochemical properties of the isolate

To test whether the virus was covered with an organic solvent-
labile lipid envelope, FX2010 was treated with either ether or
chloroform. FX2010 lost infectivity after treatmentwith either organic
solvents, indicating that it is an enveloped virus.

To define the nucleic acid type of FX2010, RNA and DNA were
extracted from purified FX2010 and subjected to agarose electropho-
Nucleotide Substitutions (x100)

band was detected (data not shown). Upon treatment of the nucleic
acid extracted from FX2010 with RNase but not DNase, the RNA band
was no longer detected.
Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

An FX2010 cDNA library was made and 100 plasmids extracted
from the bacterial clones picked randomly from the cDNA librarywere
directly sequenced. One-third of the sequences of the inserted
nucleotides shared 40%–80% identity with viruses of the flavivirus
family when analyzed by using BLAST at the NCBI. The remaining
sequences showed high identity with the rRNAs or mRNAs of Gallus
gallus. Sequences with high homology to other virus genera were not
found. The complete E gene (1–1497 nucleotides)(GenBank accession
number HQ833330)and a partial sequence (1022 nucleotides from
the 3′ terminus) of the NS5 gene (GenBank accession number
HQ833331) of FX2010 were determined when the library sequences
were compiled and analyzed by using the SEQMAN program.

To understand the taxonomic relationship of FX2010, the
sequences of the E gene, from nucleotide positions 318 to 1266 and
the 1022 nucleotide segment of the NS5 gene were compared with
those of representative flavivirus obtained from GenBank. The
nucleotide sequences of the E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010
were highly similar to those of BYD virus (sharing 99.6% and 99.7%
nucleotide identities, respectively); BYD virus was isolated from
ducks with egg-drop syndrome in China (Su et al.). The E gene and the
NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 88.3% and 88.0% nucleotide homology
with those of the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain, respectively.
Accordingly, the amino acid sequence of the E protein and the NS5
protein of FX2010 proved to be 97.2% and 98.8% identical to those of
the MM1775 strain, respectively. When compared with other viruses
in the Nyata group, to which Tembusu virus belongs, of genus
Flavivirus, the NS5 gene of FX2010 shared 69.6%, 75.1%, 76%, 71.2%,
and 76.8% nucleotide identity with that of Rocio virus, Ntaya virus,
Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, Ilheus virus, and Bagaza
virus, respectively (Fig. 3). The NS5 protein that corresponded to the
1022 nucleotide sequence from the 3′ terminus of FX2010 shared
78.2%–88.8% amino acid homology with that of these viruses. Since
the flavivirus isolates with N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the
NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998),
we designated this virus Tembusu virus Fengxian 2010 (FX2010) after
the name of the virus species, the district from which it came, and the
time when it was isolated.

of the chicken β-actin promoter, was generated. BALB/c mice were injected
intramuscularly with this protein expression plasmid every two weeks. Three weeks
after the third injection, the serum of the immunized mice was collected for cross-
neutralization assays.

Cross-neutralization assays

In cross serum neutralization tests between FX2010 and JEV, we
found weak to no cross-reactivity with heterologous antibodies; an
antiserum against FX2010 neutralized its homologous virus at a
serum dilution of 1:1580 (Table 1). In cross serum neutralizing tests
between FX2010 and Tembusu virus, an antiserum against the partial
E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010 at a
serum dilution of 1:90.

Virus replication in cell cultures

Thevirusgrew induckembryofibroblasts andVero cellswithoutany

duck embryo fibroblasts and VERO cells, respectively. Upon three
further passages of the virus in duck embryo fibroblasts, CPEs became
apparent.
Pathogenicity in ducks

Birds were thought to be the natural hosts of flaviviruses, and only
a limited number of flaviviruses were reported previously to cause
disease or death in ducks. We, therefore, infected six shelducks by
inoculating them i.n. or i.m. with 0.2 mL of supernatant of homoge-
nates of embryos containing 105 ELD50 of FX2010. One day after the
ducks were inoculated, we introduced three naïve ducks to the
isolator in which the i.n.-infected ducks were housed. Both the i.n. and
i.m. inoculated ducks lost their appetite on day 3 post-infection, and
the contact ducks showed symptoms similar to those of the infected
animals on day 5 post-contact. Upon dissection of the inoculated
ducks on day 4 post-infection and of the contact ducks on day 6 post-
exposure to the infected ducks, all of the ducks showed grossly
swollen spleens and kidneys. The three remaining ducks in each
inoculated group recovered on day 7 post-infection; no ducks died in
this experiment.

Histopathological studies showed that all of the ducks tested had
systemic lesions: moderate necrosis in the brain, severe nephrosis,
pneumorrhagia, and severe necrosis of the spleen. To detect the
specific viral antigen of FX2010 in organs, tissue sections were
subjected to immunohistochemistry with an antiserum against
FX2010. Virus antigens were found in the brain, kidney, lung, and
spleen (Fig. 4), indicating systemic infection of FX2010; no antigen
was detected in the tissues of uninfected ducks.

Upon viral titration in organs, high levels of virus were detected in
the trachea, spleen, pancreas, kidney, brain, lung, livers, and blood of
the inoculated and contact ducks (Table 2). The results show that the
virus could transmit efficiently and directly to contact animals
without mosquito.

To determine the mortality rate in a larger cohort of ducks, a total
of eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were
inoculated i.n. with 105 ELD50 of FX2010 in 0.2 mL. Of these, three
ducks died on day 7, day 10, and day 11 post-infection, yielding a
mortality rate of 7.5%. None of the forty ducks in the negative control
group died during the experiment. All of the remaining ducks that
were inoculated with FX2010 seroconverted.

Discussion

Tembusu virus (TMUV), a member of the Ntaya virus (NTAV)
group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, has been
frequently isolated from Culex and Aedes mosquitoes in Malaysia
and Thailand (Gubler et al., 2007). Although birds, including domestic
fowl, are thought to be the natural vertebrate hosts of Flavivirus
(Hoshino et al., 2009; Lindh et al., 2008), a few infectious diseases of
poultry caused by these viruses have been recorded (Ianconescu et al.,
1975). Sitiawan virus, which was isolated from sick chicken and
transmitted by Culex mosquitoes in Malaysia was one of the first
Tembusu virus strains reported to cause disease in domestic poultry
(Kono et al., 2000). Recently, Su et al. (2011) reported that a new
Tembusu-related flavivirus, BYD virus, caused duck egg-drop syn-
drome in China. The E gene and the NS5 gene of FX2010 have 99.6%
and 99.7% nucleotide identities with those of BYD virus, respectively,
suggesting that the FX2010 and BYD viruses are essentially the same
virus. The E and NS5 genes of the FX2010 and BYD viruses share about
88% nucleotide homology and 97% amino acid homologywith those of
Tembusu virus. Cross-neutralization studies with the reference
Tembusu virus would further support an antigenic relationship
between FX2010 and other Tembusu viruses. However, we could
not obtain a permit from the Chinese government to import the
reference Tembusu virus, because it does not exist in China. However,
we found that the antiserum to the partial E protein (aa 107-422) of
Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized FX2010, whereas antise-
rum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not. These results suggest a
close antigenic relationship between FX2010 and Tembusu virus
Mm1775 strain. Recently, classification of adenoviruses based on



C

Fig. 4 (continued).

5P. Yan et al. / Virology 417 (2011) 1–8
sequences, not serology, was suggested and debated widely (Aoki
et al., 2011; Imperiale and Enquist, 2011; Seto et al., 2011). For
flavivirus, isolateswith N84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5
region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998).
Therefore, FX2010 and BYD virus represent a new strain of Tembusu
virus because the former viruses share about 88.0% nucleotide
homology for the NS gene with the Tembusu virus MM1775 strain.
Although BYD virus was described as a new Tembusu-related flavivirus
(Su et al.), we suggest that the virus be named as a Tembusu virus. A
Tembusu virus has never before been detected in China. Given the
limited sequence information available, it is not possible for us to
speculate which of the amino acid differences may contribute to the
different pathogenic properties of these viruses in ducks.

Only a limited number of flaviviruses have been reported to cause
duck infectious diseases (Wojnarowicz et al., 2007), although many
flaviviruses, whose pathogenicity for animals is unknown, have been
isolated from mosquitoes, ticks, and bats (Cook et al., 2009; Crabtree
et al., 2009; Ebel, 2009; Epstein et al., 2010; Hoshino et al., 2009;
Huhtamo et al., 2009; Junglen et al., 2009; Morales-Betoulle et al.,
2008; Platt et al., 1975; Roiz et al., 2009; Saiyasombat et al., 2010).
Tembusu virus was isolated frommosquitoes in Kuala Lumpur in 1955
(Kono et al., 2000). Since then, Tembusu virus has been isolated from
the Culex species of mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand. Encephalitis
and retarded growth of chicks caused by a Tembusu virus was firstly
reported in Malaysia (Kono et al., 2000). In addition, high levels of
serum-neutralizing antibody against Tembusu virus have been
reported in humans in Malaysia, although a disease associated with
Tembusu virus infection had not yet been reported (Kono et al., 2000).
It remains unknown whether FX2010-like Tembusu virus can infect
humans, although the virus has spread widely in Southeast China.
However, given that the areas where FX2010-like Tembusu virus is
circulating are among the most densely populated areas in the world,
this virus may pose a threat to human health in the future. We
recommend that human serological surveillance be conducted in
FX2010-likeTembusu virus -circulating areas as soon as possible.

Materials and methods

Field samples

In a shelduck layer farm in the Fengxian district of Shanghai, China,
an outbreak of a disease characterized by retarded growth, egg
production decline, and 10% mortality was observed in 9–26-week-
old ducks. Postmortem examinations were performed on the dead
ducks. Tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin; 3-um sections were stain with
hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic diagnosis.

Virus isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs

The homogenated spleens of dead shelducks were mixed with an
equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), filtered through
0.22 um filters and inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF
embryonated chicken eggs (0.1 mL per egg). Embryos and the chorio-
allantoic membranes of the eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation
were pooled, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatants were
stored at −80 °C until use for virologic and molecular analyses.

Virus purification

The above-described supernatant of homogenated embryos and
chorio-allantoicmembraneswas subjected toultra-speed centrifugation;

the pellet was resuspended in PBS, loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose
density gradient of 30%, 45%, and 60% (W/V), and centrifuged for 2 h at
35,000 rpm. The fraction between the 30% and 45% sucrose gradient was
collected and ultra-centrifuged; the pellet was resuspended in PBS.
Electron microscopy

Purified virus was negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid
and observed under a JEM2100 transmission electron microscope.

Nucleic acid extraction and identification

Nucleic acid was extracted from purified virus by using the
QIAamp Viral RNAMini Kit (QIAGEN Inc. Valencia, CA, US) or the Viral
DNA Extraction Kit (ABigen Inc, Beijing, China), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. To determine the nucleic acid type,
extracted nucleic acid was treated with RNase and DNase (Takara
Biotechnology, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.

Construction of a cDNA library of viral genes

Viral cDNAs were synthesized by using a cDNA Library Construc-
tion Kit (Takara), which includes the following steps: first strand
cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA synthesis, adaptor ligation,
restriction enzyme treatment, vector ligation, and competent Jm109
cell transformation. Bacterial clones were picked at random for
sequence analysis.

Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Plasmids extracted from the bacterial clones picked from the cDNA
library were directly sequenced by use of the BigDye® Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Foster, CA, USA) and an ABI 3500 genetic
analyzer. To compile and analyze the sequences, we used the SEQMAN
program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The sequences of the reference
viruses were obtained from GenBank by using the basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion (NCBI) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The nucleotide
sequences were compared and phylogenetic trees were generated
with the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR) by using the Clustal
alignment algorithm. The sequences of the following reference viruses
were included in the phylogenetic analysis: Baiyangdian (BYD) virus,
JF312912; Tembusu virus strain MM1775, AF013408.1; Tembusu virus
Sitiawan, AB110489.1; Rocio virus, AF013397.1; Ntaya virus, AF013392.
1; Israel turkey Meningoencephalitis virus, AF013377.1; Ilheus virus,
AF013376.1; and Bagaza virus, AF013363.1.

Cross-neutralization assays

Antisera against the FX2010 virus were collected from ducks
21 days after i.m. inoculation with 105 ELD50 of FX2010. The
antiserum to JEV was from a pig infected with JEV, strain SA-1414-2
(provided by Shanghai Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shang-
hai, PRC). Because Tembusu virus and antiserum to it were not
available in our laboratory, a portion of the E gene encoding amino
acids 107 to 422 with artificial start and stop codons was synthesized
based on the sequence in GenBank (AB110494.1). A protein
expression plasmid, pCAGGS-E, possessing this partial E gene under
the control of the chicken β-actin promoter was generated. BALB/c
mice were injected i.m. with this protein expression plasmid every
two weeks. Three weeks after the third injection, the serum of the
immunized mice was collected for cross-neutralization assays. The
viruses used in the cross-neutralization assays were FX2010 (second
passage in embryonated chicken eggs) and JEV (provided by Shanghai
Hile bio-pharmaceutical corporation, Shanghai, PRC). Serial ten-fold
dilutions starting from a 1:5 dilution of the heat-inactivated antisera
were mixed with 100 TCID50 of JEV or 100 ELD50 of FX2010 and
incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture containing JEV was then
inoculated into BHK cells, and the mixture containing FX2010 was
inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For the neutralization
assays with JEV, the results were read when cytopathic effects (CPEs)
were observed in control cultures (no antiserum) and the serum
neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the
serum dilution that inhibited CPEs. For the neutralization assays with
FX2010, the serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the
reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited egg embryo death
6 days post-inoculation.

Virus replication in cell cultures

African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and duck embryo
fibroblast cultures were used for virus replication. These cells were
grown in 75 mm flasks and then infected with 100 ELD50 of FX2010 in
1 mL of PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions of viral samples (0.1 mL) were
inoculated into the allantoic sacs of 9-day-old SPF embryonated
chicken eggs and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Three eggs were used
for each dilution. The eggs that died 24–120 h post-inoculation were
considered virus-positive; the 50% egg lethal dose (ELD50) was
calculated by using Reed and Muench's method. To detect CPEs,
FX2010 was passaged five times in duck embryo fibroblasts.

Duck experiments

To determine the pathogenicity of the virus isolate, six 9-week-old
ducks (a local outbred strain of shelducks) were inoculated intranasally
(i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 50% lethal doses for eggs
(ELD50) of virus in 0.2 mL of supernatant of homogenized embryos and
chorio-allantoic membranes of eggs that died 24–120 h post-inocula-
tion with FX2010 and housed separately in two isolators. One day after
inoculation, to test the transmissibility of the virus, three contact ducks
were introduced into the isolator in which the ducks that had been
inoculated i.n. were housed. Three virus-inoculated ducks in each group
and three uninfected control ducks were euthanized on day 4. Six days
after being co-housedwith the virus-inoculated ducks, the three contact
ducks were euthanized. Samples of lung, trachea, kidney, brain, liver,
pancreas, spleen, and blood were collected and virus titers were
determined by using 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. For
histopathological study, samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin solution, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Alternatively, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted with an
antiserumagainst the virus isolate. The three remainingducks thatwere
inoculated i.n. or i.mwere observed daily for 10 days for signs of disease.

To determine the mortality rate of ducks infected with FX2010,
eighty 9-week-old shelducks were used. Forty ducks were inoculated
i.n. with 0.2 mL of 105 ELD50 of FX2010 virus, and another forty ducks
were inoculated i.n. with the same volume of PBS. The two groups of
ducks were housed separately in different rooms and were observed
daily for 20 days for signs of disease, and the number of duck deaths
was recorded.
